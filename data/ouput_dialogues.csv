(Eerie music in background) One Ranger splits off and finds a campsite full of mutilated bodies, including a child hanging from a tree branch. A birds-eye view shows the bodies arranged in a shield-like pattern. The Ranger rides back to the other two."
1,"WAYMAR ROYCE: What d’you expect? They’re savages. One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it, they’re ripping each other to pieces."
2,"WILL: I’ve never seen wildlings do a thing like this. I’ve never seen a thing like this, not ever in my life."
3,WAYMAR ROYCE: How close did you get?
4,WILL: Close as any man would.
5,GARED: We should head back to the wall.

7,GARED: Our orders were to track the wildlings. We tracked them. They won’t trouble us no more.
8,ROYCE: You don’t think he’ll ask us how they died? Get back on your horse.
9,NARRATOR:GARED grumbles.
10,WILL: Whatever did it to them could do it to us. They even killed the children.
11,"ROYCE: It’s a good thing we’re not children. You want to run away south, run away. Of course, they will behead you as a deserter … If I don’t catch you first. Get back on your horse. I won’t say it again."
12,"NARRATOR:WILL glares, but obeys. Sometime later, the three Rangers return to the campsite, which is now completely cleared."
13,ROYCE: Your dead men seem to have moved camp.

19,"NARRATOR:As he speaks, a CREATURE with glowing blue eyes rises behind ROYCE. ROYCE turns, the CREATURE strikes. The scene shifts to WILL, who hears a man crying out. The three horses stampede past him. He turns and sees someone standing very still in the distance. The figure turns – it’s the child who had been suspended in the tree, now with glowing blue eyes. WILL turns and runs."
20,"NARRATOR:GARED is also fleeing, and we hear strange growls and catch glimpses of the CREATURE. Both terrified RANGERS stop, some distance apart, to catch their breath. WILL sees a CREATURE behead GARED. WILL sinks to his knees and the CREATURE tosses GARED’S head to him."
21,NARRATOR:Blackout
22,"NARRATOR:TITLE SEQUENCERiders from Winterfell come up behind a dazed WILL. The scene shifts to the castle, where BRAN is practicing archery and getting frustrated, under the eyes of JON SNOW and ROBB STARK. JON pats BRAN’S shoulder."

45,"NED: Tell Bran he’s coming, too."
46,NARRATOR:CASSEL nods and departs.
47,CATELYN: Ned. Ten is too young to see such things.
48,NED: He won’t be a boy forever. And winter is coming.
49,"NARRATOR:NED departs. In the courtyard, ROBB and JON gather the arrows. CATELYN turns and glares down on JON. He looks at her and walks away."
50,"ROBB: Lad, go run back and get the rest."
51,"NARRATOR:Scene shifts, and we see WILL being taken to the block."
52,"WILL (muttering): White Walkers. I saw the White Walkers. White Walkers. The White Walkers, I saw them."
53,NARRATOR:He and NED face each other.
54,"WILL: I know I broke my oath. And I know I’m a deserter. I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them. But I saw what I saw. I saw the White Walkers. People need to know. If you can get word to my family, tell them I’m no coward. Tell them I’m sorry."
55,"NARRATOR:NED nods yes, and WILL is positioned on the tree limb that serves as a block. NED draws Ice from a scabbard held by Theon."

63,NARRATOR:NED swings ICE and beheads WILL. BRAN does not look away.
64,JON: You did well.
65,NARRATOR:He walks away. ROBB turns and puts his arm around BRAN and they go to their horses together. NED approaches BRAN.
66,NED: You understand why I did it?
67,BRAN: Jon said he was a deserter.
68,NED: But do you understand why I had to kill him?
69,BRAN: Our way is the old way?
70,NED: The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword.
71,BRAN: Is it true he saw the White Walkers?
72,NED: The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years.
73,BRAN: So he was lying?

96,"BRAN: Please, father!"
97,"NED: I’m sorry, Bran."

109,"JAIME: As your brother, I feel it’s my duty to warn you: You worry too much. It’s starting to show."
110,"CERSEI: And you never worry about anything. When we were seven, you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock. One hundred foot drop into the water. And you were never afraid."
111,"JAIME: There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father. In a whisper, mimicking We’re Lannisters. Lannisters don’t act like fools."
112,CERSEI: What if Jon Arryn told someone?
113,JAIME: But who would he tell?
114,CERSEI: My husband.
115,"JAIME: If he told the king, both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now. Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didn’t know, it died with him. And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king, someone to do his job while he’s off fucking boars and hunting whores. Or is it the other way around? And life will go on."
116,CERSEI: You should be the Hand of the king.

118,NARRATOR:Scene shifts to a raven approaching Winterfell. CATELYN crosses a busy courtyard and finds NED in the godswood.
119,CATELYN: All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here.
120,NED: You have five northern children. You’re not an outsider.
121,CATELYN: I wonder if the old gods agree.
122,NED: It’s your gods with all the rules.
123,"CATELYN: I am so sorry, my love."
124,NED: Tell me.
125,CATELYN: There was a raven from Kings Landing. Jon Arryn is dead. A fever took him. I know he was like a father to you.

127,CATELYN: They both have their health. Gods be good. pause The raven brought more news. The king rides for Winterfell. With the queen and all the rest of them.
128,"NED: He’s coming this far North, there’s only one thing he’s after."
129,"CATELYN: You can always say no, Ned."
130,NARRATOR:Scene shifts to the Winterfell great hall where a great banquet is being prepared.

136,"NARRATOR:Scene shifts to Robb, Theon, and Jon getting barbered."
137,JON: Why’s your mother so dead-set on us getting pretty for the king?
138,"THEON: It’s for the queen, I bet. I hear she’s sleek as a mink?"
139,ROBB: I hear the prince is a right royal prick.
140,THEON: Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick.
141,"ROBB: Go on, Tommy, shave him good. He’s never met a girl he likes better than his own hair."
142,"NARRATOR:Scene shifts to the royal procession approaching Winterfell. Bran sees them from his perch high atop a castle wall and clambers nimbly down to tell everyone. CATELYN and LUWIN walk to the courtyard, passing BRAN’s wolf pup."
143,"CATELYN: Gods, but they grow fast. Seeing BRAN on the wall Brandon!"
144,BRAN: I saw the king! He’s got hundreds of people!
145,CATELYN: How many times have I told you: No climbing!
146,BRAN: But he’s coming right now! Down our road!
147,CATELYN: I want you to promise me: No more climbing.
148,BRAN (looking down): I promise.
149,CATELYN: D’you know what?
150,BRAN: What?
151,CATELYN: You always look at your feet before you lie. Run and find your father. Tell him the king is close.
152,"NARRATOR:BRAN runs off, followed by his wolf pup."

159,NED: Your Grace.
160,ROBERT: You’ve got fat.
161,NARRATOR:NED gives ROBERT a “What about you?” look. They start laughing.
162,ROBERT: Cat!
163,CATELYN: Your Grace.
164,ROBERT: Nine years. Why haven’t I seen you? Where the hell have you been?
165,"NED: Guarding the North for you, Your Grace. Winterfell is yours."
166,NARRATOR:CERSEI and her other children descend from the coach.
167,ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
168,SANSA: Will you shut up?
169,"ROBERT: Who have we here? You must be Robb. (To Sansa) My, you’re a pretty one. (To Arya) Your name is?"
170,ARYA: Arya.
171,NARRATOR:ROBERT (to BRAN) Ooh. Show us your muscles. You’ll be a soldier.

175,NARRATOR:CERSEI approaches.
176,NED: My queen.
177,CATELYN: My queen.
178,ROBERT: Take me to your crypt. I want to pay my respects.
179,"CERSEI: We’ve been riding for a month, my love. Surely the dead can wait."
180,ROBERT: Ned.
181,ARYA: Where’s the Imp?
182,"NARRATOR:CERSEI, humiliated in front of all, walks back to JAIME."
183,CERSEI: Where is our brother? Go find the little beast.
184,NARRATOR:Scene changes to the crypt.
185,NED: Tell me about Jon Arryn.
186,"ROBERT: One minute he was fine, and then … Burned right through him, whatever it was. I loved that man."
187,NED: We both did.
188,"ROBERT: He never had to teach you much, but me … You remember me at 16? All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls. He showed me what was what."
189,NED: Aye.
190,"ROBERT: Don’t look at me like that. Not his fault I didn’t listen. (They laugh. ROBERT sighs.) I need you, Ned. Down at Kings Landing. Not up here, where you’re no damn use to anybody. Lord Eddard Stark, I would name you the Hand of the king."
191,NARRATOR:NED kneels.
192,NED: I’m not worthy of the honor.
193,"ROBERT: I’m not trying to honor you. I’m trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat, drink, and whore my way to an early grave. Damn it, Ned, stand up. You helped me win the Iron Throne, now help me keep the damn thing. We were meant to rule together. If your sister had lived, we would have been bound by blood. Well, it’s not too late. I have a son, you have a daughter. We’ll join our Houses."
194,"NARRATOR:Scene changes to JAIME in the Winterfell settlement. We see Tyrion inside a whorehouse, swilling liquor and laughing as a woman pops into view after servicing him."
195,TYRION: Mmh. It is true what they say about the Northern girls.
196,ROS: Did you hear the king’s in Winterfell?
197,TYRION: I did hear something about that.
198,ROS: And the queen. And her twin brother. They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.
199,TYRION: And the other brother?
200,ROS: The queen has two brothers?
201,TYRION: There’s the pretty one. And there’s the clever one.
202,ROS: I hear they call him the Imp.
203,TYRION: I hear he hates that nickname.
204,ROS: Oh? I hear he’s more than earned it. I hear he’s a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions.
205,TYRION: Clever girl.
206,"ROS: We’ve been expecting you, Lord Tyrion."
207,TYRION: Have you?
208,TYRION: The gods gave me one blessing.
209,NARRATOR:She climbs on TYRION. JAIME walks in without knocking.
210,JAIME: Don’t get up.
211,ROS: M’lord.
212,"TYRION: Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse, brother?"
213,"JAIME: You’ve much to teach me, no doubt. But our sister craves your attention."
214,"TYRION: She has odd cravings, our sister."
215,"JAIME: A family trait. Now, the Starks are feasting us at sundown. Don’t leave me alone with these people."
216,"TYRION: I’m sorry, I’ve begun the feast a bit early. And this is the first of many courses."
217,"JAIME: I thought you might say that. But since we’re short on time, (he opens the door; a bevy of whores enter and descend on TYRION) Come on, girls. See you at sundown."
218,NARRATOR:JAIME leaves.
219,TYRION: Close the door!
220,"NARRATOR:Scene changes to the Winterfell crypt, at Lyanna’s tomb. Robert places a feather in the hand of her statue."
221,ROBERT: Did you have to bury her in a place like this? She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her.
222,NED: She was my sister. This is where she belongs.
223,ROBERT: She belonged with me.
224,NARRATOR:He touches Lyanna’s face.
225,"ROBERT: In my dreams, I kill him every night."
226,"NED: It’s done, Your Grace. The Targaryens are gone."
227,ROBERT: Not all of them.
228,"NARRATOR:Scene shifts to Daenerys on a balcony in Pentos, across the Narrow Sea."
229,VISERYS (off camera): Daenerys!
230,NARRATOR:He enters a large chamber.
231,VISERYS: Daenerys! There’s our bride to be! Look – a gift from Illyrio. Touch it. Come on. Feel the fabric. Mmmm. Isn’t he a gracious host?
232,DAENERYS: We’ve been his guests for over a year and he’s never asked us for anything.
233,"VISERYS: Illyrio is no fool. He knows I won’t forget my friends when I come into my throne. You still slouch. Let me see. (He pulls off her gown.) You have a woman’s body now. (She endures it as he strokes her breast.) I need you to be perfect today. Can you do that for me? You don’t want to wake the dragon, do you?"
234,DAENERYS: No.
235,NARRATOR:VISERYS nods and starts to leave the chamber. He turns.
236,"VISERYS: When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say it began today."
237,NARRATOR:Daenerys turns and steps into a steaming hot bath with a despairing look on her face.
238,"MAID: It’s too hot, my lady."
239,"NARRATOR:But DAENERYS keeps stepping deeper. The scene shifts to ILLYRIOS, DAENERYS, AND VISERYS outside the mansion, awaiting Khal Drogo."
240,VISERYS: Where is he?
241,ILLYRIO: The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality.
242,NARRATOR:A host of Dothraki come riding up. Khal Drogo wheels his stallion into the front.
243,"ILLYRIO: (Greets them in Dothraki.) May I present my honored guests? Viserys of House Targaryen, the third of his name. The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men. And his sister, Daenerys, of the House Targaryen."
244,"NARRATOR:VISERYS (to DAENERYS) Do you see how long his hair is? When Dothraki are defeated in combat, they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame. Khal Drogo has never been defeated. He’s a savage, of course, but he’s one of the finest killers alive. And you will be his queen."
245,"ILLYRIO: Come forward, my dear."
246,"NARRATOR:KHAL DROGO watches as DAENERYS walks toward him. She does not hesitate and looks straight at him, although there is fear on her face. KHAL DROGO gazes at her and then leads his horsemen on a charge away."
247,VISERYS: Where’s he going?
248,ILLYRIO: The ceremony is over.
249,VISERYS: But he didn’t say anything. Did he like her?
250,"ILLYRIO: Trust me, Your Grace. If he didn’t like her, we’d know."
251,"NARRATOR:The scene shifts to ILLYRIO, VISERYS, AND DAENERYS ON A GARDEN BALCONY OVERLOOKING THE SEA."
252,ILLYRIO: It won’t be long now. Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your father’s throne. The people drink secret toasts to your health. They cry out for their true king.
253,VISERYS: When will they be married?
254,ILLYRIO: Soon. The Dothraki never stay still for long.
255,VISERYS: Is it true they lie with their horses?
256,ILLYRIO: I wouldn’t ask Khal Drogo.
257,VISERYS: Do you take me for a fool?
258,ILLYRIO: I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I’ve given offense.
259,VISERYS: I know how to play a man like Drogo. I give him a queen and he gives me an army.
260,NARRATOR:DAENERYS (pleadingly) I don’t want to be his queen. I want to go home.
261,"VISERYS: So do I. I want us both to go home. But they took it from us. So tell me, sweet sister, how do we go home?"
262,DAENERYS: I don’t know.
263,"VISERYS: We go home with an army. With Khal Drogo’s army. I would let his whole tribe fuck you, all 40,000 men and their horses too, if that’s what it took."
264,"NARRATOR:He gives DAENERYS a brotherly kiss on the forehead and walks away. The scene shifts to a bedroom in Winterfell, where CATELYN is fixing SANSA’S hair."
265,SANSA: Do you think Joffrey will like me? What if he thinks I’m ugly?
266,CATELYN: Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived.
267,SANSA: He’s so handsome.
268,NARRATOR:CATELYN rolls her eyes.
269,SANSA: When would we be married? Soon or do we have to wait?
270,CATELYN: Hush now. Your father hasn’t even said yes.
271,SANSA: Why would he say no? He’d be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms.
272,CATELYN: He’d have to leave home. He’d have to leave me. And so would you.
273,SANSA: You left your home to come here. And I’d be queen someday. Please make father say yes.
274,CATELYN: Sansa…
275,"SANSA: Please, please. It’s the only thing I ever wanted."
276,"NARRATOR:Scene shifts to the Winterfell banquet. Laughter, music, KING ROBERT getting bawdy with a wench. CATELYN and CERSEI watch, CATELYN embarrassed for CERSEI, who looks disgusted. Out in the courtyard, JON takes out his frustration on a fencing dummy. His uncle BENJEN rides up."
277,BENJEN: Is he dead yet?
278,JON: Uncle Benjen!
279,NARRATOR:They hug.
280,BENJEN: You got bigger. I rode all day. Didn’t want to leave you alone with the Lannisters. Why aren’t you at the feast?
281,JON: Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst.
282,"BENJEN: Well, you’re always welcome on the wall. No bastard was ever refused a seat there."
283,JON: So take me with you when you go back.
284,BENJEN: Jon…
285,"JON: Father will let me if you ask him, I know he will."
286,BENJEN: The Wall isn’t going anywhere.
287,JON: I’m ready to swear your oath.
288,BENJEN: You don’t understand what you’d be giving up. We have no families. None of us will ever father sons.
289,JON: I don’t care about that.
290,"BENJEN: You might, if you knew what it meant. … I’d better get inside. Rescue your father from his guests. We’ll talk later."
291,NARRATOR:BENJEN goes to the banquet.
292,TYRION: Your uncle’s in the Night’s Watch.
293,JON: What’re you doing back there?
294,TYRION (drinking): Preparing for a night with your family. I’ve always wanted to see the Wall.
295,JON: You’re Tyrion Lannister. The queen’s brother?
296,"TYRION: My greatest accomplishment. You – you’re Ned Stark’s bastard, aren’t you?"
297,NARRATOR:JON looks angry and turns away.
298,"TYRION: Did I offend you? Sorry. You are the bastard, though."
299,JON: Lord Eddard Stark is my father.
300,"TYRION: And Lady Stark is not your mother. Making you a bastard. Let me give you some advice, bastard. Never forget what you are. The rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor. Then it can never be used to hurt you."
301,JON: What the hell do you know about being a bastard?
302,TYRION: All dwarves are bastards in their fathers’ eyes.
303,NARRATOR:TYRION departs. JON picks up his sword and attacks the dummy with new ferocity.
304,"NARRATOR:The scene shifts back to the banquet, in full raucous swing. NED is off to himself; BENJEN comes up to him."
305,NED: The boy I beheaded. Did you know him?
306,"BENJEN: Of course I did. Just a lad. But he was tough, Ned. A true Ranger."

You were right about Eddard Stark. lf he were alive, we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun, which would have given us more time to deal with Robert's brothers. But now – madness. Madness and stupidity. l always thought you were a stunted fool. Perhaps l was wrong. "
579,"Tyrion Lannister:  Half wrong. l'm new to strategy, but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies, it appears we can't stay here."

581,Tyrion Lannister:  And do what?
582,"Tywin Lannister:  Rule. You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead. You will bring that boy king to heel, and his mother too, if needs be. And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest – Baelish, Varys, Pycelle…"
583,"Tyrion Lannister:  Heads, spikes, walls. Why not my uncle? Why not anyone? Why me?"

599,"Mirri Maz Duur:  As you command, lady. Come. l will take you to him."
600,Jorah Mormont:  Time enough for that later –
601,Daenerys Targaryen:  l want to see him now.
602,"NARRATOR:They leave the tent/yurt, following Mirri Maz Duur to the place where Drogo is lying."
603,Daenerys Targaryen:  The khalasar is gone.
604,"Jorah Mormont:  A khal who cannot ride is no khal. The Dothraki follow only the strong. l'm sorry, my Princess."
605,"Daenerys Targaryen:  Drogo! (in Dothraki) My sun and stars. (in the Common Tongue, to the rest) Why is he out here alone?"
606,"Jorah Mormont:  He seems to like the warmth, Princess."
607,"Mirri Maz Duur:  He lives. You asked for life, you paid for life."
608,Daenerys Targaryen:  (looking at Drogo’s catatonic expression) This is not life. When will he be as he was?
609,"Mirri Maz Duur:  When the sun rises in the west, sets in the east. When the seas go dry. When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves."
610,Daenerys Targaryen:  Leave us.
611,Jorah Mormont:  l don't want you alone with this sorceress.
612,Daenerys Targaryen:  l have nothing more to fear from this woman. Go.
613,NARRATOR:Daenerys and Mirri Maz Duur have a conversation alone.
614,Daenerys Targaryen:  You knew what l was buying and you knew the price.
615,Mirri Maz Duur:  lt was wrong of them to burn my temple. lt angered the Great Shepherd.
616,Daenerys Targaryen:  This is not God's work. My child was innocent.
617,Mirri Maz Duur:  lnnocent? He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World. Now he will burn no cities. Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust.
618,Daenerys Targaryen:  l spoke for you. l saved you.
619,"Mirri Maz Duur:  Saved me? Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me, girl. l saw my god's house burn, there where l had healed men and women beyond counting. ln the streets l saw piles of heads, the head of the baker who makes my bread, the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past. So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved?"
620,Daenerys Targaryen:  Your life.
621,Mirri Maz Duur:  Why don't you take a look at your khal. Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone.

649,"Shae:  I’m funny now? l'm Shae, the funny whore."
650,"Tyrion Lannister:  My father's probably the most powerful man in the country. Certainly the richest. He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets. Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says. He's always been a cunt. l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you. Why don't you come with me, be the Hand's lady? Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand – (Shae kisses Tyrion)"

689,Ros:  So what's the thing?

700,Petyr Baelish:  lt's hard for them to simper and bow without heads.
701,Varys:  A man with great ambition and no morals… l wouldn't bet against you.

704,Petyr Baelish:  You must be one of the few men in the city who isn't a man.
705,"Varys:  Oh, you can do better than that."
706,"Petyr Baelish:  When they castrated you, did they take the pillar with the stones? l've always wondered."
707,Varys:  Have you? Do you spend a lot of time wondering what's between my legs?
708,Petyr Baelish:  l picture a gash. Like a woman's. ls that about right?
709,"Varys:  l am flattered, of course, to be pictured at all."
710,"Petyr Baelish:  Must be strange for you, even after all these years… a man from another land, despised by most, feared by all."
711,Varys:  Am l? That is good to know. Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash?
712,Petyr Baelish:  But you carry on whispering in one king's ear and then the next. l admire you.
713,"Varys:  And l admire you, Lord Baelish. A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men – and women."
714,"Petyr Baelish:  A useful talent, l'm sure you'd agree."
715,Varys:  So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect.

723,Arya Stark:  Arry.
724,"Yoren:  You've a long way to travel, and in bad company. l've 20 this time –  men and boys all bound for the Wall. Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons, and l didn't find no little lordlings down there. This lot – half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon. And the other half would do the same, except they'd rape you first. So keep to yourself – and when you piss, do it in the woods alone. You stay with this lot, boy. And stay or l'll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three."

729,Lommy Greenhands:  Maybe he's a little squire.

731,Lommy Greenhands:  Let's have a look. (wrestles Arya to the ground)
732,Hot Pie:  l could use me a sword like that.
733,Lommy Greenhands:  Take it off him.
734,"Hot Pie:  Give it here, midget."
735,Lommy Greenhands:  Look at him! You'd better give Hot Pie the sword. l've seen him kick a boy to death.
736,Hot Pie:  l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead. l kicked him all to pieces. You better give me that sword!
737,Arya Stark:  (pointing Needle at Hot Pie) You want it? l'll give it to you. l already killed one fat boy. l bet you never killed anyone. l bet you're a liar. But l'm not. l'm good at killing fat boys. l like killing fat boys.

740,Arya Stark:  lt was a gift.
741,"Gendry:  lt don't matter now. Where we're going, they don't care what you've done. They've got rapers, pickpockets, highwaymen, murderers."
742,Arya Stark:  Which are you?
743,"Gendry:  Armourer's apprentice. But my master got sick of me, so here l am."

749,"NARRATOR:(Jon looks at the Lord Commander with surprise) Don't look so terrified. lf we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night, only ghosts would guard the Wall. At least you weren't whoring in Mole's Town. Honor made you leave, honor brought you back."

751,Jeor Mormont:  l didn't say it was your honor.
752,Jon Snow:  They killed my father.
753,"Jeor Mormont:  And you're gonna bring him back to life, are you? No? Good. We've had enough of that sort of thing. Beyond the Wall, the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned. At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn. A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold, to what ends the gods only know. Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pyke's men discovered four blue-eyed corpses. Unlike us, they were wise enough to burn them. Do you think your brother's war is more important than ours?"
754,Jon Snow:  No.
755,"Jeor Mormont:  When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night, do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne?"

758,Jon Snow:  Beyond the Wall?
759,"Jeor Mormont:  l'll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows. l mean to find out what's happening. The Night's Watch will ride in force against the wildlings, the White Walkers and whatever else is out there. And we will find Benjen Stark, alive or dead. l will command them myself. So l'll only ask you once, Lord Snow, are you a brother of the Night's Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war?"

764,Jorah Mormont:  Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands. Sell them. You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days.
765,Daenerys Targaryen:  They were not given to me to sell.
766,"Jorah Mormont:  Khaleesi, my Queen, l vow to serve you, obey you, to die for you if need be, but let him go, Khaleesi. l know what you intend. Do not."
767,Daenerys Targaryen:  l must. You don't understand.
768,Jorah Mormont:  Don't ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre. l won't watch you burn.
769,"Daenerys Targaryen:  ls that what you fear? (kisses Jorah on the cheek, then speaks to the rest of the Dothraki and Lhazareen who stayed with her)  You will be my khalasar. l see the faces of slaves. l free you. Take off your collars. Go if you wish, no one will stop you. But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters, as husbands and wives."

774,Daenerys Targaryen:  I will. But it is not your screams I want. Only your life.
775,"NARRATOR:Daenerys walks towards the pyre and lights it on fire with a torch. Mirri Maz Duur starts uttering some incantations which quickly turn into screaming. Daenerys walks into the burning pyre as her dress catches fire. The flames engulf everything, and the screen fades to black."

781,Daenerys Targaryen: Isn't there anything else?
782,"Jorah Mormont: The Dothraki have two things in abundance: grass and horses. People can't live on grass... In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night. It murders all other grass. The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything. That's the way the world will end… It'll get easier."

788,Viserys Targaryen: I have no interest in hospitality or comfort. I'll stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown.
789,"Jorah Mormont: As you wish, your Grace."
790,"Viserys Targaryen: Well, Mormont, as brutish as this life is, I suppose it is preferable to beheading. What did Ned Stark want you for? Buying from a slaver?"
791,Jorah Mormont: Selling to one... Some poachers I caught on my land.
792,"Viserys Targaryen: Under my reign, you won't be punished for such nonsense. You can rest assured of that."
793,NARRATOR:Joffrey finding Tyrion asleep in the dog’s pen of Winterfell.

796,Joffrey Baratheon: What good will my sympathies do them?
797,Tyrion Lannister: None. But it is expected of you. Your absence has already been noted.
798,Joffrey Baratheon: The boy means nothing to me. And I can't stand the wailing of women.
799,Tyrion Lannister: One word and I'll hit you again.
800,Joffrey Baratheon: I'm telling mother!
801,"Tyrion Lannister: Go! Tell her. But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are, that you are at their service, and that all your prayers are with them. Do you understand?"
802,Joffrey Baratheon: You can't...
803,Tyrion Lannister: Do you understand?

810,Myrcella Baratheon: Is Bran going to die?
811,Tyrion Lannister: Apparently not.
812,Cersei Baratheon: What do you mean?
813,Tyrion Lannister: The Maester says the boy may live.
814,"Cersei Baratheon: It's no mercy, letting a child linger in such pain."
815,Tyrion Lannister: Only the gods know for certain. All the rest of us can do is pray. The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you.
816,Cersei Baratheon: I still can't believe you're going. It's ridiculous even for you.
817,"Tyrion Lannister: Where's your sense of wonder? The greatest structure ever built, the intrepid men of the Night's Watch, the wintry abode of the White Walkers."
818,Jaime Lannister: Tell me you're not thinking of taking the black.
819,Tyrion Lannister: And go celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
820,Cersei Baratheon: The children don't need to hear your filth. Come.
821,"Jaime Lannister: Even if the boy lives, he'll be a cripple, a grotesque. Give me a good clean death any day."
822,"Tyrion Lannister: Speaking for the grotesques, I'd have to disagree. Death is so final, whereas life... Life is full of possibilities. I hope the boy does wake. I'd be very interested to hear what he has to say."
823,"Jaime Lannister: My dear brother, there are times you make me wonder whose side you're on."
824,"Tyrion Lannister: My dear brother, you wound me. You know how much I love my family."
825,"NARRATOR:In Bran’s room with Catelyn at his bedside, Cersei coming to console."

827,"Catelyn Stark:  I would have dressed, your Grace."
828,"Cersei Baratheon: This is your home. I'm your guest. Handsome one, isn't he? I lost my first boy, a little black-haired beauty. He was a fighter too... Tried to beat the fever that took him. Forgive me. It's the last thing you need to hear right now."
829,Catelyn Stark: I never knew.
830,"Cersei Baratheon:  It was years ago. Robert was crazed, beat his hands bloody on the wall, all the things men do to show you how much they care... The boy looked just like him. Such a little thing... A bird without feathers. They came to take his body away and Robert held me. I screamed and I battled, but he held me. That little bundle. They took him away and I never saw him again. Never have visited the crypt, never. I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you."
831,Catelyn Stark:  I am grateful..
832,Cersei Baratheon: Perhaps this time she'll listen.
833,NARRATOR:Near the Smith in a courtyard of Winterfell.
834,Jaime Lannister: A sword for the wall?
835,Jon Snow: I already have one.
836,Jaime Lannister: Good man. Have you swung it yet?
837,Jon Snow: Of course I have.
838,"Jaime Lannister:  At someone, I mean. It's a strange thing, the first time you cut a man. You realize we're nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing. Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall... Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot. We're grateful to have good, strong men like you protecting us."
839,Jon Snow: We've guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years.
840,"Jaime Lannister: Is it ""we"" already? Have you taken your vows then?"
841,Jon Snow: Soon enough.
842,"Jaime Lannister: Give my regards to the Night's Watch. I'm sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force. And if not, It's only for life."
843,"NARRATOR:Arya’s room, packing things for her trip to King’s Landing, having her direwolf assist her. Jon comes in to say goodbye before he leaves for the Night's Watch."
844,"Arya Stark: Thank you, Nymeria. Septa Mordane says I have to do it again. ""My things weren't properly folded"", she says. Who cares how they're folded?! They're going to get all messed up anyway."
845,Jon Snow: It's good you've got help.
846,"Arya Stark: Watch. Nymeria, gloves."
847,Jon Snow:  Impressive.
848,"Arya Stark:  Shut up. Nymeria, gloves!"
849,Jon Snow:  I have something for you. And it has to be packed very carefully.
850,Arya Stark:  A present?
851,Jon Snow:  Close the door. This is no toy. Be careful you don't cut yourself.
852,Arya Stark:  It's so skinny.
853,"Jon Snow: So are you. I had the blacksmith make it for you special. It won't hack a man's head off, but it can poke him full of holes if you're quick enough."
854,Arya Stark: I can be quick.
855,Jon Snow:  You'll have to work at it every day. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
856,Arya Stark: I think so.
857,Jon Snow: First lesson: Stick them with the pointy end.
858,Arya Stark:  I know which end to use.
859,"Jon Snow:  I'm going to miss you... Careful... All the best swords have names, you know."
860,Arya Stark:  Sansa can keep her sewing needles. I've got a needle of my own.
861,"NARRATOR:Jon walks into Bran’s room, where Catelyn is still at his bedside."
862,Jon Snow:  I came to say goodbye to Bran.
863,Catelyn Stark:  You've said it.
864,"Jon Snow:  I wish I could be here when you wake up. I'm going north with Uncle Benjen. I'm taking the black. I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together, but you'll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when you're better. I'll know my way around by then. I'll be a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. We can go out walking beyond the Wall, if you're not afraid."
865,Catelyn Stark: I want you to leave.
866,"NARRATOR:Eddard walks into the room, Jon kisses Brandon on the forehead and exits."
867,Catelyn Stark: 17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon. You came back a year later with another woman's son. And now you're leaving again.
868,Eddard Stark:  I have no choice.
869,"Catelyn Stark: That's what men always say when honor calls. That's what you tell your families, tell yourselves. You do have a choice. And you've made it. I can't do it, Ned. I really can't."
870,Eddard Stark:  You can. You must.
871,"NARRATOR:In the courtyard, Jon prepping his horse to leave for the Wall."
872,Robb Stark: You've said goodbye to Bran? He's not going to die. I know it.
873,Jon Snow:  You Starks are hard to kill.
874,Robb Stark: My mother?
875,Jon Snow:  She was very kind.
876,"Robb Stark: Good. Next time I see you, you'll be all in black."
877,Jon Snow:  It was always my color.
878,"Robb Stark: Farewell, Snow."
879,"Jon Snow:  And you, Stark."
880,NARRATOR:At the split between the Kingsroad and the road that will take Benjen and Jon to the Wall.
881,"Eddard Stark: There's great honor serving in the Night's Watch. The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years. And you are a Stark. You might not have my name, but you have my blood."
882,"Jon Snow: Is my mother alive? Does she know about me? Where I am, where I'm going? Does she care?"
883,"Eddard Stark: The next time we see each other, we'll talk about your mother. I promise."
884,NARRATOR:Stopping for rest along the Kingsroad. Robert has a mini table set up full of wine and food.
885,"Robert Baratheon: Gods, this is country! I've half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going."
886,Eddard Stark:  I've half a mind to go with you.
887,"Robert Baratheon: What do you say, just you and me on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides, a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight."
888,Eddard Stark: You should have asked me 20 years ago.
889,"Robert Baratheon: There were wars to fight, women to marry... We never had the chance to be young."
890,Eddard Stark:  I recall a few chances.
891,"Robert Baratheon: There was that one... Oh, what was her name? That common girl of yours? Becca? With the great big tits you could bury your face in."
892,Eddard Stark:  Bessie. She was one of yours.
893,Robert Baratheon: Bessie! Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits. Yours was... Aleena? No. You told me once. Meryl? Your bastard's mother?
894,Eddard Stark:  Wylla.
895,Robert Baratheon: That's it. She must have been a rare wench to make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor. You never told me what she looked like.
896,Eddard Stark:  Nor will I.
897,"Robert Baratheon: We were at war. None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again. You're too hard on yourself. You always have been. I swear if I weren't your King, you'd have hit me already."
898,Eddard Stark: The worst thing about your coronation... I'll never get to hit you again.
899,"Robert Baratheon: Trust me, that's not the worst thing. There was a rider in the night."
900,Eddard Stark:  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Should we send her a wedding gift?
901,"Robert Baratheon: A knife perhaps, a good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it."
902,Eddard Stark: She's little more than a child.
903,Robert Baratheon: Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding.
904,Eddard Stark:  Tell me we're not speaking of this.
905,"Robert Baratheon: Oh, it's unspeakable to you? What her father did to your family... That was unspeakable. What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister... the woman I loved. I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on."
906,"Eddard Stark:  But you can't get your hands on this one, can you?"
907,"Robert Baratheon:  This Khal Drogo, it's said he has 100,000 men in his horde."
908,"Eddard Stark: Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea. They have no ships, Robert."
909,"Robert Baratheon:  There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the scum will join him."
910,"Eddard Stark: He will not cross. And if by chance he does, we'll throw him back into the sea."
911,"Robert Baratheon: There's a war coming, Ned. I don't know when, I don't know who we'll be fighting, but it's coming."
912,"NARRATOR:Back across the sea, Drogo fornicates with Daenerys, she’s clearly not enjoying it."
913,"NARRATOR:On their way to the Wall, stopping to set up camp for the night."
914,Benjen Stark: Sit. You'll be fed. Untie them.
915,Tyrion Lannister: Rapers. They were given a choice no doubt... Castration or the Wall. Most choose the knife. Not impressed by your new brothers? Lovely thing about the Watch... You discard your old family and get a whole new one.
916,Jon Snow: Why do you read so much?
917,Tyrion Lannister: Look at me and tell me what you see.
918,Jon Snow:  Is this a trick?
919,"Tyrion Lannister:  What you see is a dwarf. If I'd been born a peasant they might've left me out in the woods to die. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years."
920,Jon Snow: Until your brother killed that King.
921,"Tyrion Lannister: Yes, until my brother killed him. Life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him. I must do my part for the honor of my house, wouldn't you agree? But how? Well, my brother has his sword and I have my mind. And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone. That's why I read so much. And you? What's your story, bastard?"
922,"Jon Snow: Ask me nicely and maybe I'll tell you, dwarf."
923,"Tyrion Lannister:  A bastard boy with nothing to inherit, off to join the ancient order of the Night's Watch, alongside his valiant brothers-in-arms."
924,Jon Snow: The Night's Watch protects the realm from...
925,"Tyrion Lannister: Yes yes, against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. You're a smart boy. You don't believe that nonsense... Everything's better with some wine in the belly."
926,"NARRATOR:Bran’s bedroom, Catelyn still at his bedside, Maester Luwin walks in."
927,"Maester Luwin: It's time we reviewed the accounts, my lady. You'll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us."
928,Catelyn Stark:  Talk to Poole about it.
929,"Maester Luwin: Poole went south with Lord Stark, my lady. We need a new steward, and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention..."
930,Catelyn Stark: I don't care about appointments!
931,Robb Stark:  I'll make the appointments. We'll talk about it first thing in the morning.
932,"Maester Luwin: Very good, my Lord. My Lady."
933,Robb Stark:  When was the last time you left this room?
934,Catelyn Stark:  I have to take care of him.
935,"Robb Stark: He's not going to die, mother. Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed."
936,Catelyn Stark: What if he's wrong? Bran needs me.
937,"Robb Stark: Rickon needs you. He's six. He doesn't know what's happening. He follows me around all day, clutching my leg, crying..."
938,Catelyn Stark: Close the windows! I can't stand it! Please make them stop! (Wolf’s howling repeatedly)
939,Robb Stark:  Fire. You stay here. I'll come back.
940,Assassin: You're not supposed to be here. No one is supposed to be here. It's a mercy. He's dead already.
941,Catelyn Stark:  No!
942,"NARRATOR:The man is an assassin, when he draws his blade, Catelyn begins to fend him off. In the process her hands are both sliced. The man walks within inches of Bran and his direwolf comes in and mauls the assassin."
943,NARRATOR:In Daenerys’ tent across the Narrow Sea.
944,Daenerys Targaryen:  Have you ever seen a dragon?
945,"Irri: Dragon gone, Khaleesi."
946,Daenerys Targaryen:  Everywhere? Even in the east?
947,Irri: No dragon. Brave men kill them. It is known.
948,Jhiqui: It is known.
949,Doreah: A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon.
950,Daenerys Targaryen: The moon?
951,"Doreah: He told me the moon was an egg, Khaleesi, that once there were two moons in the sky. But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat. Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the sun's fire."
952,Irri: Moon is no egg. Moon is goddess... wife of sun. It is known.
953,Jhiqui: It is known.
954,Daenerys Targaryen: Leave me with her. Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories?
955,NARRATOR:Irri leaves the tent.
956,"Doreah: Men like to talk when they're happy. Before your brother bought me for you, it was my job to make men happy."
957,Daenerys Targaryen: How old were you?
958,Doreah: I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house.
959,Daenerys Targaryen:  Nine?!
960,"Doreah: I did not touch a man for three years, Khaleesi. First you must learn."
961,Daenerys Targaryen:  Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy?
962,Doreah: Yes.
963,Daenerys Targaryen: Will it take three years?
964,Doreah: No.
965,"NARRATOR:Jon, Tyrion, Benjen and company arrive at the wall and look at it from afar."
966,Benjen Stark: Welcome.
967,"NARRATOR:Catelyn is on the ground where Bran’s body was discovered, below the tower he fell from. She looks up and sees the window. She now is looking through that same window where Bran fell. She investigates the room, noticing a cleared patch on some flooring, finding a long blonde hair."
968,"NARRATOR:Catelyn holds council in the Godswood with Robb, Theon Greyjoy, Rodrick and Maester Luwin."
969,Catelyn Stark:  What I am about to tell you must remain between us. I don't think Bran fell from that tower. I think he was thrown.
970,Maester Luwin: The boy was always sure-footed before.
971,Catelyn Stark: Someone tried to kill him twice. Why? Why murder an innocent child? Unless he saw something he wasn't meant to see.
972,"Theon Greyjoy: Saw what, my lady?"
973,Catelyn Stark: I don't know. But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved. We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown.
974,"Rodrick Cassel: Did you notice the dagger the killer used? It's too fine a weapon for such a man. The blade is Valyrian steel, the handle dragonbone. Someone gave it to him."
975,Robb Stark:  They come into our home and try to murder my brother? If it's war they want...
976,"Theon Greyjoy: If it comes to that, you know I'll stand behind you."
977,"Maester Luwin: What, is there going to be a battle in the Godswood? Too easily words of war become acts of war. We don't know the truth yet. Lord Stark must be told of this."
978,Catelyn Stark:  I don't trust a raven to carry these words.
979,Robb Stark:  I'll ride to King's Landing.
980,Catelyn Stark:  No. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. I will go myself.
981,"Robb Stark:  Mother, you can't."
982,Catelyn Stark: I must.
983,Rodrick Cassel: I'll send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you.
984,Catelyn Stark:  Too large a party attracts unwanted attention. I don't want the Lannisters to know I'm coming.
985,Rodrick Cassel: Let me accompany you at least. The Kingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone.
986,Robb Stark:  What about Bran?
987,Catelyn Stark:  I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month. Bran's life is in their hands now.
988,"NARRATOR:Back at Daenerys’ tent, Doreah is on top of her, “teaching” Daenerys how to please Khal Drogo."
989,"Doreah: No, Khaleesi. You must look in his eyes always. Love comes in at the eyes. It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes."
990,Daenerys Targaryen: Finish a man?
991,Doreah: Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia. Magisters sold their palaces. Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours. They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all.
992,"Daenerys Targaryen:  Well, she sounds like an interesting woman. I don't think that Drogo will like it with me on top."
993,"Doreah: You will make him like it, Khaleesi. Men want what they've never had. And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch. Are you a slave, Khaleesi? Then don't make love like a slave. Very good, Khaleesi. Out there he is the mighty Khal, but in this tent, he belongs to you."
994,Daenerys Targaryen:  I don't think that this is the Dothraki way.
995,"Doreah: If he wanted the Dothraki way, why did he marry you?"
996,Daenerys Targaryen:  No. No. Tonight I would look upon your face.
997,"NARRATOR:The Lannisters, traveling Starks and all royal guards have stopped for the evening to rest on their way to King’s Landing."
998,"Sansa Stark:  Pardon me, Ser."
999,"Sandor Clegane: Do I frighten you so much, girl? Or is it him there making you shake? He frightens me too. Look at that face."
1000,"Sansa Stark:  I'm sorry if I offended you, Ser. Why won't he speak to me?"
1001,Sandor Clegane: He hasn't been very talkative these last 20 years. Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers.
1002,"Joffrey Baratheon: He speaks damn well with his sword though. Ser Ilyn Payne, the King's justice. The royal executioner. What is it, sweet lady? Does the hound frighten you? Away with you, dog. You're scaring my lady. I don't like to see you upset. The sun is finally shining. Come walk with me."
1003,"Sansa Stark: Stay, Lady. I probably shouldn't have any more. Father only lets us have one cup at feasts."
1004,Joffrey Baratheon:  My princess can drink as much as she wants. Don't worry... You're safe with me.
1005,"NARRATOR:In a field next to a river, off from where everyone else is."
1006,Mycah: I'll get you!
1007,Sansa Stark:  Arya!
1008,Arya Stark: What are you doing here? Go away.
1009,"Joffrey Baratheon:  Your sister? And who are you, boy?"
1010,"Mycah: Mycah, my Lord."
1011,Sansa Stark: He the butcher's boy.
1012,Arya Stark: He's my friend.
1013,"Joffrey Baratheon:  A butcher's boy who wants to be a Knight, eh? Pick up your sword, butcher's boy. Let's see how good you are."
1014,"Mycah: She asked me to, my Lord. She asked me to."
1015,"Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm your prince, not your lord, and I said pick up your sword."
1016,"Mycah: It's not a sword, my prince. It's only a stick."
1017,"Joffrey Baratheon: And you're not a Knight. Only a butcher's boy. That was my lady's sister you were hitting, do you know that?"
1018,Arya Stark: Stop it!
1019,"Sansa Stark:  Arya, stay out of this."
1020,Joffrey Baratheon:  I won't hurt him... Much. Filthy little bitch!
1021,"Sansa Stark:  No no, stop it, stop it, both of you. You're spoiling it. You're spoiling everything!"
1022,"Joffrey Baratheon:  I'll gut you, you little cunt!"
1023,Sansa Stark: Arya!
1024,"NARRATOR:Arya then steps in and fights with Joffrey, disarming him and putting him on his back. Her direwolf sees this as a thread and runs in to defend."
1025,Arya Stark:  Nymeria!
1026,Joffrey Baratheon:  Please don't.
1027,"Sansa Stark:  Arya, leave him alone. My prince, my poor prince, look what they did to you. Stay here, I'll go back to the inn and bring help."
1028,Joffrey Baratheon: Then go! Don't touch me.
1029,NARRATOR:A hunt has begun for the direwolf that attacked Joffrey.
1030,Soldier 1: The wolf's not here. Look down by the stream.
1031,NARRATOR:Arya hidden from everyone telling her direwolf to leave.
1032,Arya Stark:  You've got to go. They'll kill you for what you did to Joffrey. Go on... run. Go! Leave now!
1033,Soldier 2: It's a direwolf.
1034,Soldier 1: I'll check down here.
1035,Soldier 2: I think I heard a noise.
1036,Arya Stark:  Go!
1037,NARRATOR:Jory comes to tell Ned that his daughter has been found.
1038,Jory Cassel: My lord! My lord! They found her. She's unharmed.
1039,Eddard Stark: Where is she?
1040,Jory Cassel: She's been taken directly before the King.
1041,Eddard Stark: Who took her?
1042,Jory Cassel: The Lannisters found her.
1043,"Eddard Stark: Right, get back."
1044,Jory Cassel: The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him.
1045,Eddard Stark: Back! Back to the inn. All back!
1046,NARRATOR:Now back at the Inn where everyone is staying.
1047,Arya Stark:  I'm sorry.
1048,Eddard Stark: Are you hurt?
1049,Arya Stark: No.
1050,Eddard Stark: It's all right. What is the meaning of this? Why was my daughter not brought to me at once?
1051,Cersei Baratheon:  How dare you speak to your King in that manner?
1052,"Robert Baratheon: Quiet, woman. Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl. But we need to get this business done quickly."
1053,Cersei Baratheon: Your girl and that butcher's boy attacked my son. That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.
1054,Arya Stark:  That's not true! She just... Bit him a little. He was hurting Mycah.
1055,Cersei Baratheon: Joffrey told us what happened. You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him.
1056,Arya Stark:  That's not what happened!
1057,Joffrey Baratheon:  Yes it is! They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river.
1058,Arya Stark:  Liar!
1059,Joffrey Baratheon:  Shut up!
1060,"Robert Baratheon: Enough! He tells me one thing, she tells me another. Seven hells! What am I to make of this? Where's your other daughter, Ned?"
1061,Eddard Stark: In bed asleep.
1062,"Cersei Baratheon: She's not. Sansa, come here, darling."
1063,"Robert Baratheon: Now, child... Tell me what happened. Tell it all and tell it true. It's a great crime to lie to a King."
1064,Sansa Stark: I don't know. I don't remember. Everything happened so fast. I didn't see.
1065,Arya Stark: Liar! Liar liar liar!
1066,Sansa Stark: Arya!
1067,Eddard Stark: Stop it! That's enough of that.
1068,Arya Stark:  Liar liar liar!
1069,Eddard Stark: Stop! Arya!
1070,Cersei Baratheon:  She's as wild as that animal of hers. I want her punished.
1071,"Robert Baratheon: What would you have me do, whip her through the streets? Damn it, children fight. It's over."
1072,Cersei Baratheon:  Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life.
1073,Robert Baratheon: You let that little girl disarm you? See to it that your daughter is disciplined. I'll do the same with my son.
1074,"Eddard Stark: Gladly, your Grace."
1075,Cersei Baratheon:  And what of the direwolf? What of the beast that savaged your son?
1076,Robert Baratheon: I'd forgot the damned wolf.
1077,"Soldier: We found no trace of the direwolf, your Grace."
1078,Robert Baratheon: So be it.
1079,Cersei Baratheon: We have another wolf.
1080,Robert Baratheon:  As you will.
1081,Eddard Stark: You can't mean it.
1082,Robert Baratheon: A direwolf's no pet. Get her a dog. She'll be happier for it.
1083,"Sansa Stark: He doesn't mean Lady, does he? No no, not Lady! Lady didn't bite anyone! She's good!"
1084,Arya Stark: Lady wasn't there! You leave her alone!
1085,Sansa Stark:  Stop them. Don't let them do it. Please! It wasn't Lady!
1086,Eddard Stark: s this your command... your Grace?
1087,Cersei Baratheon:  Where is the beast?
1088,"Soldier: Chained up outside, your Grace."
1089,"Cersei Baratheon: Ser Ilyn, do me the honor."
1090,"Eddard Stark: No. Jory... Take the girls to their rooms. If it must be done, then I'll do it myself."
1091,Cersei Baratheon: Is this some trick?
1092,Eddard Stark:  The wolf is of the north. She deserves better than a butcher.
1093,"NARRATOR:Once outside, before Eddard lays to rest the direwolf."
1094,Eddard Stark: The butcher's boy... You rode him down?
1095,Sandor Clegane: He ran... Not very fast.
1096,NARRATOR:Eddard kills the direwolf on the King’s orders.
1097,"NARRATOR:The King, Eddard and the rest of the posse have arrived at King’s Landing."
1098,"King’s Landing Guard: Welcome, Lord Stark. Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council. The honor of your presence is requested."
1099,"Eddard Stark: Get the girls settled in. I'll be back in time for supper. And, Jory, you go with them."
1100,"Jory Cassel: Yes, my Lord."
1101,King’s Landing Guard: If you'd like to change into something more appropriate…
1102,"NARRATOR:Ned Stark gives the guard a blank stare before taking off his gloves, the guard realizes Ned’s disinterest and the two begin walking to the council chamber. First they walk through the Great Hall, where the throne sits. Jaime Lannister is lingering in front of the throne."
1103,"Jaime Lannister: Thank the gods you're here, Stark. About time we had some stern northern leadership."
1104,Eddard Stark: Glad to see you're protecting the throne.
1105,"Jaime Lannister: Sturdy old thing. How many kings' asses have polished it, I wonder? What's the line? The King shits and the Hand wipes."
1106,Eddard Stark:  Very handsome armor. Not a scratch on it.
1107,"Jaime Lannister: I know. People have been swinging at me for years, but they always seem to miss."
1108,Eddard Stark: You've chosen your opponents wisely then.
1109,"Jaime Lannister: I have a knack for it. It must be strange for you coming into this room. I was standing right here when it happened. He was very brave, your brother. Your father too. They didn't deserve to die like that. Nobody deserves to die like that."
1110,Eddard Stark:  But you just stood there and watched.
1111,"Jaime Lannister: 500 men just stood there and watched. All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms. You think anyone said a word, lifted a finger? No, Lord Stark. 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt. Except for the screams, of course, and the Mad King laughing. And later... When I watched the Mad King die, I remembered him laughing as your father burned... It felt like justice."
1112,Eddard Stark: Is that what you tell yourself at night? You're a servant of justice? That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryen's back?
1113,"Jaime Lannister: Tell me... If I'd stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back, would you admire me more?"
1114,"Eddard Stark:  You served him well, when serving was safe."
1115,NARRATOR:Ned enters the small council’s chamber where the others are already awaiting him.
1116,Varys: Lord Stark.
1117,Eddard Stark: Lord Varys.
1118,Varys: I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad. We are all praying for Prince Joffrey's full recovery.
1119,Eddard Stark:  A shame you didn't say a prayer for the butcher's son. Renly! You're looking well.
1120,"Renly Baratheon: And you look tired from the road. I told them this meeting could wait another day, but..."
1121,"Petyr Baelish: But we have a Kingdom to look after. I've hoped to meet you for some time, Lord Stark. No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me."
1122,"Eddard Stark:  She has, Lord Baelish. I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well."
1123,Petyr Baelish: All too well. I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone.
1124,Eddard Stark: Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with.
1125,"Petyr Baelish: It wasn't the man that I chose, my Lord. It was Catelyn Tully. A woman worth fighting for, I'm sure you'll agree."
1126,"Grand Maester Pycelle: I humbly beg your pardon, my Lord Stark."
1127,Eddard Stark:  Grand Maester.
1128,Grand Maester Pycelle: How many years has it been? You were a young man.
1129,Eddard Stark: And you served another King.
1130,"Grand Maester Pycelle: How forgetful of me. This belongs to you, now. Should we begin?"
1131,Eddard Stark:  Without the King?
1132,"Renly Baratheon: Winter may be coming, but I'm afraid the same cannot be said for my brother."
1133,Varys: His Grace has many cares. He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load.
1134,Petyr Baelish:  We are the lords of small matters here.
1135,Renly Baratheon: My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Stark's appointment as Hand of the King.
1136,"Petyr Baelish:  Mmm, how much?"
1137,"Eddard Stark: 40,000 gold dragons to the champion, 20,000 to the runner-up, 20,000 to the winning archer."
1138,Grand Maester Pycelle: Can the treasury bear such expense?
1139,"Petyr Baelish:  I'll have to borrow it. The Lannisters will accommodate, I expect. We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold. What's another 80,000?"
1140,Eddard Stark:  Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt?
1141,Petyr Baelish: I'm telling you the Crown is six million in debt.
1142,Eddard Stark:  How could you let this happen?
1143,Petyr Baelish:  The Master of Coin finds the money. The King and the Hand spend it.
1144,Eddard Stark:  I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm.
1145,"Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice, but I fear His Grace doesn't always listen."
1146,"Renly Baratheon: ""Counting coppers,"" he calls it."
1147,Eddard Stark:  I'll speak to him tomorrow. This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford.
1148,"Petyr Baelish:  As you will. But still, we'd best make our plans."
1149,"Eddard Stark:  There will be no plans until I speak to Robert. Forgive me, my Lords. I had a long ride."
1150,"Varys: You are the King's Hand, Lord Stark, we serve at your pleasure."
1151,NARRATOR:Cersei tending to Joffrey’s “wound”.
1152,"Cersei Baratheon: Please, it's nearly healed."
1153,Joffrey Baratheon:  It's ugly.
1154,"Cersei Baratheon: A King should have scars, you fought off a direwolf. You're a warrior like your father."
1155,"Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm not like him. I didn't fight off anything. It bit me and all I did was scream. And the two Stark girls saw it, both of them."
1156,"Cersei Baratheon: That's not true. You killed the beast. You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father. When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne, your father was a rebel and a traitor. Someday you'll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it."
1157,Joffrey Baratheon: Do I have to marry her?
1158,"Cersei Baratheon: Yes. She's very beautiful and young. If you don't like her, you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes, to make little princes and princesses. And if you'd rather fuck painted whores, you'll fuck painted whores. And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it. You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be. Do something nice for the Stark girl."
1159,Joffrey Baratheon:  I don't want to.
1160,"Cersei Baratheon: No, but you will. The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road."
1161,Joffrey Baratheon: We allow the northerners too much power. They consider themselves our equals.
1162,Cersei Baratheon: How would you handle them?
1163,"Joffrey Baratheon:  I'd double their taxes and command them to supply 10,000 men to the royal army."
1164,Cersei Baratheon:  A royal army?
1165,"Joffrey Baratheon:  Why should every lord command his own men? It's primitive, no better than the hill tribes. We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown, trained by experienced soldiers... Instead of a mob of peasants who've never held pikes in their lives."
1166,Cersei Baratheon: And if the northerners rebel?
1167,"Joffrey Baratheon: I'd crush them. Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North. Uncle Kevan, maybe."
1168,"Cersei Baratheon: And these 10,000 northern troops, would they fight for you or their lord?"
1169,Joffrey Baratheon:  For me. I'm their King.
1170,"Cersei Baratheon:  But you've just invaded their homeland, asked them to kill their brothers."
1171,Joffrey Baratheon:  I'm not asking.
1172,"Cersei Baratheon: The North cannot be held... not by an outsider. It's too big and too wild. When the winter comes, the Seven gods together couldn't save you and your royal army. A good King knows when to save his strength... And when to destroy his enemies."
1173,Joffrey Baratheon:  So you agree... The Starks are enemies?
1174,Cersei Baratheon:  Everyone who isn't us is an enemy.
1175,"NARRATOR:Arya, Sansa and their Septa are all around a table eating. Arya is stabbing a knife into the table between her fingers."
1176,"Septa Mordane: Enough of that, young lady. Eat your food."
1177,Arya Stark:  I'm practicing.
1178,Sansa Stark:  Practicing for what?
1179,Arya Stark: The Prince.
1180,"Septa Mordane: Arya, stop!"
1181,Arya Stark: He's a liar and a coward and he killed my friend.
1182,Sansa Stark: The Hound killed your friend.
1183,Arya Stark: The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do.
1184,Sansa Stark: You're an idiot.
1185,"Arya Stark: You're a liar. And if you told the truth, Mycah would be alive."
1186,Septa Mordane: Enough!
1187,NARRATOR:Septa Mordane begins escorting Arya away from the table as Ned walks in.
1188,Eddard Stark:  What's happening here?
1189,Septa Mordane: Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady.
1190,"Eddard Stark:  Go to your room. We'll speak later. That's for you, love…"
1191,NARRATOR:Ned places a wrapped package in front of Sansa on the table.
1192,Eddard Stark:  The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcella's toys. Don't you like it?
1193,Sansa Stark: I haven't played with dolls since I was eight. May I be excused?
1194,Septa Mordane: You've barely eaten a thing.
1195,Eddard Stark:  It's all right. Go on.
1196,"NARRATOR:Sansa gets up from the table, leaving only Ned and Septa Mordane."
1197,Eddard Stark: War was easier than daughters.
1198,NARRATOR:Arya is unsheathing Needle privately in her room as Ned knocks on the door.
1199,Arya Stark: Go away!
1200,"Eddard Stark: Arya, open the door. May I come in? Whose sword is that?"
1201,Arya Stark:  Mine.
1202,Eddard Stark:  Give it to me. I know this maker's mark. This is Mikken's work. Where did you get this? This is no toy. Little ladies shouldn't play with swords.
1203,Arya Stark: I wasn't playing. And I don't want to be a lady.
1204,Eddard Stark:  Come here. Now what do you want with this?
1205,Arya Stark:  It's called Needle.
1206,Eddard Stark:  A blade with a name. And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle? Your sister? Do you know the first thing about sword fighting?
1207,Arya Stark: Stick 'em with the pointy end.
1208,Eddard Stark: laughs That's the essence of it.
1209,Arya Stark: I was trying to learn. I asked Mycah to practice with me. I asked him. It was my fault.
1210,"Eddard Stark:  No, sweet girl. You didn't kill the butcher's boy."
1211,"Arya Stark: I hate them! I hate all of them. The Hound, the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa."
1212,Eddard Stark:  Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen... And asked to call the Prince a liar.
1213,Arya Stark: So was I! He is a liar.
1214,"Eddard Stark: Darling, listen to me. Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday. She cannot betray him. She must take his side even when he's wrong."
1215,Arya Stark: But how you can let her marry someone like that?
1216,Eddard Stark: Well… Look at me. You're a Stark of Winterfell. You know our words.
1217,Arya Stark: Winter is coming.
1218,"Eddard Stark: You were born in the long summer. You've never known anything else. But now winter is truly coming. And in the winter, we must protect ourselves, look after one another. Sansa is your sister."
1219,Arya Stark: I don't hate her. Not really.
1220,"Eddard Stark: I don't want to frighten you, but I won't lie to you either. We've come to a dangerous place. We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves. All right? Go on. It's yours."
1221,Arya Stark: I can keep it?
1222,"Eddard Stark:  Try not to stab your sister with it. If you're going to own a sword, you'd better know how to use it."
1223,NARRATOR:Bran’s bedside in Winterfell. A crow lands on his windowsill.
1224,Old Nan:  Don't listen to it. Crows are all liars. I know a story about a crow.
1225,Bran Stark:  I hate your stories.
1226,Old Nan:  I know a story about a boy who hated stories. I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall. Those were always your favorites.
1227,Bran Stark: Those weren't my favorites. My favorites were the scary ones.
1228,"Old Nan: Oh, my sweet summer child. What do you know about fear? Fear is for the winter, when the snows fall a hundred feet deep. Fear is for the long night, when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness. That is the time for fear, my little Lord, when the White Walkers move through the woods. Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation. Kings froze to death in their castles, same as the shepherds in their huts. And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve, and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks. So is this the sort of story that you like? In that darkness, the White Walkers came for the first time. They swept through cities and kingdoms, riding their dead horses, hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds…"
1229,"NARRATOR:Robb walks into the room, interrupting Old Nan’s story."
1230,Robb Stark:  What are you telling him now?
1231,Old Nan: Only what the little Lord wants to hear.
1232,Robb Stark:  Get your supper. I want some time with him. One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blue-eyed giant named Macumber.
1233,Bran Stark:  Maybe we do.
1234,"Robb Stark:  How do you feel? You still don't remember anything? I've seen you climb a thousand times. In the wind, in the rain... A thousand times. You never fall."
1235,"Bran Stark:  I did though. It's true, isn't it... what Maester Luwin says about my legs? I'd rather be dead."
1236,Robb Stark: Don't ever say that.
1237,Bran Stark: I'd rather be dead.
1238,"NARRATOR:Catelyn and Rodrick arrive at King’s Landing, entering through a back entrance."
1239,"Rodrick Cassel: Fewer eyes back here, my Lady. But still too many."
1240,Catelyn Stark:  It's nine years since I've set foot in the capital. And no one knew who I was the last time I came either.
1241,Rodrick Cassel: My Lady.
1242,"NARRATOR:Two guards pull up to her on horseback and hand her a scroll, informing her that she is to follow them."
1243,"Guard: Welcome to King's Landing, Lady Stark. Would you mind following us?"
1244,Catelyn Stark:  I would. We've done nothing wrong.
1245,Guard: We've been instructed to escort you into the city.
1246,"Catelyn Stark: Instructed? I don't know who's providing your instructions, but..."
1247,"Guard: Follow me, Lady Stark."
1248,NARRATOR:At Baelish’s brothel.
1249,Petyr Baelish:  Cat! Go on. Go upstairs. (to his whores)
1250,Catelyn Stark:  You little worm! You take me for some back-alley Sally you can drag into a…
1251,"NARRATOR:Two naked whores interrupt, Baelish snaps at them to leave."
1252,Petyr Baelish: I meant no disrespect to you of all people.
1253,Catelyn Stark:  How dare you bring me here! Have you lost your mind?
1254,Petyr Baelish:  No one will come looking for you here. Isn't that what like you wanted? I'm truly sorry... about the locale.
1255,Catelyn Stark:  How did you know I was coming to King's Landing?
1256,Petyr Baelish: A dear friend told me.
1257,Varys:  Lady Stark.
1258,Catelyn Stark:  Lord Varys.
1259,Varys:  To see you again after so many years is a blessing. Your poor hands.
1260,Catelyn Stark: How did you know I was coming?
1261,"Varys:  Knowledge is my trade, my Lady. Did you bring the dagger with you, by any chance? My little birds are everywhere. Even in the north. They whisper to me the strangest stories. Valyrian steel."
1262,Catelyn Stark:  Do you know whose dagger this is?
1263,Varys:  I must admit I do not.
1264,"Petyr Baelish:  Well well, this is an historic day. Something you don't know that I do. There's only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms. It's mine."
1265,Catelyn Stark:  Yours?
1266,"Petyr Baelish: At least it was, until the tournament on Prince Joffrey's last nameday. I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting, as any sane man would. When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him, I lost this dagger."
1267,Catelyn Stark: To whom?
1268,Petyr Baelish:  Tyrion Lannister. The Imp.
1269,"NARRATOR:At Castle Black, in a courtyard. Grenn and Jon are swordfighting, Jon getting the best of him and breaking his nose."
1270,"Alliser Thorne: If that were a real sword, you'd be dead. Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you. Pyp. Do you think Ned Stark's bastard bleeds like the rest of us?"
1271,NARRATOR:Pyp steps forward and with one move Jon has him on his back.
1272,Alliser Thorne: Next!
1273,"NARRATOR:Jon quickly dispatches of another newcomer, we see Lord Commander Jeor and Tyrion looking on from a balcony."
1274,Alliser Thorne: Next!
1275,"NARRATOR:Another man starts againt Jon Snow, as another joins, Jon defeats the two of them almost instantly."
1276,"Alliser Thorne: Lord Snow, it appears you're the least useless person here. Go clean yourselves up. There's only so much I can stomach in a day."
1277,"NARRATOR:Tyrion and Lord Commander talking, overlooking the courtyard."
1278,Tyrion Lannister: A charming man.
1279,Jeor Mormont: I don't need him to be charming. I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Night's Watch.
1280,"Tyrion Lannister: And how's that going, Commander Mormont?"
1281,Jeor Mormont: Slowly. A raven came for Ned Stark's son.
1282,Tyrion Lannister: Good news or bad?
1283,Jeor Mormont: Both.
1284,"NARRATOR:Back in the throne room, just outside of the small council chambers."
1285,Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Stark. I meant to give you this earlier. So forgetful these days. A raven from Winterfell this morning.
1286,Petyr Baelish:  Good news? Perhaps you'd like to share it with your wife?
1287,Eddard Stark:  My wife is in Winterfell.
1288,Petyr Baelish:  Is she?
1289,NARRATOR:Baelish leads Ned to the entrance of his brothel. Ned is not so keen on the idea and begins choking Baelish.
1290,Petyr Baelish:  I thought that she'd be safest in here. One of several such establishments I own.
1291,Eddard Stark: You're a funny man. A very funny man.
1292,Catelyn Stark:  Ned! poking her head out of a window
1293,"Petyr Baelish: The Starks... Quick tempers, slow minds."
1294,"NARRATOR:Jon is in the armory of Castle Black, putting away equipment when a gang of the guys jump him."
1295,"Grenn: You broke my nose, bastard!"
1296,Jon Snow:  It's an improvement.
1297,"Grenn: If we threw you over the Wall, wonder how long it'd take you to hit."
1298,Pyp: I wonder if they'd find you before the wolves did.
1299,"Grenn: What're you looking at, halfman?"
1300,Tyrion Lannister:  I'm looking at you. You've got an interesting face. Very distinctive faces. All of you.
1301,Rast: What do you care about our faces?
1302,"Tyrion Lannister: It's just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in King's Landing. Perhaps I'll write my sister, the Queen, about it."
1303,"Grenn: We'll talk later, Lord Snow."
1304,Jon Snow: Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me. No one but you. My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same.
1305,Tyrion Lannister:  Grenn's father left him too... Outside a farmhouse when he was three. Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese. His little sister hadn't eaten in three days. He was given a choice: his right hand or the Wall. I've been asking the Lord Commander about them. Fascinating stories.
1306,Jon Snow: They hate me because I'm better than they are.
1307,Tyrion Lannister: It's a lucky thing none of them were trained by a master-at-arms like your Ser Rodrik. I don't imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here. Your brother Bran. He's woken up.
1308,NARRATOR:At Baelish’s brothel.
1309,Petyr Baelish: The mere suggestion that the Queen's brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason.
1310,Catelyn Stark: We have proof. We have the blade.
1311,"Petyr Baelish:  Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him. The only man who could say otherwise has no throat, thanks to your boy's wolf."
1312,Catelyn Stark:  Petyr has promised to help us find the truth. He's like a little brother to me. He would never betray my trust.
1313,"Petyr Baelish:  I'll try to keep you alive, for her sake. A fool's task, admittedly, but I've never been able to refuse your wife anything."
1314,Catelyn Stark: I won't forget this. You're a true friend.
1315,Petyr Baelish:  Don't tell anyone. I have a reputation to maintain.
1316,NARRATOR:In the Queen’s chambers.
1317,Cersei Baratheon: How could you be so stupid?
1318,Jaime Lannister: Calm down.
1319,Cersei Baratheon: He's a child... 10 years old. What were you thinking?
1320,Jaime Lannister: I was thinking of us. You're a bit late to start complaining about it now. What has the boy told them?
1321,Cersei Baratheon: Nothing. He's said nothing. He remembers nothing.
1322,Jaime Lannister: Then what are you raving about?
1323,Cersei Baratheon: What if it comes back to him? If he tells his father what he saw...
1324,Jaime Lannister: We'll say he was lying. We'll say he was dreaming. We'll say whatever we like. I think we can outfox a 10-year-old.
1325,Cersei Baratheon: And my husband?
1326,"Jaime Lannister: I'll go to war with him if I have to. They can write a ballad about us : ""The War for Cersei's Cunt."""
1327,"NARRATOR:Cersei hits Jaime, he spins her around and hugs her from behind, whispering into her ear."
1328,Cersei Baratheon: Let me go.
1329,Jaime Lannister: Never.
1330,Cersei Baratheon: Let me go.
1331,"Jaime Lannister: The boy won't talk. And if he does, I'll kill him. Him, Ned Stark, the King... the whole bloody lot of them, until you and I are the only people left in this world."
1332,NARRATOR:In a back alley before Catelyn leaves King’s Landing.
1333,Catelyn Stark:  I wish I could see the girls.
1334,Eddard Stark:  It's too dangerous.
1335,Catelyn Stark: Just for a moment.
1336,Eddard Stark:  Until we know who our enemies are...
1337,"Catelyn Stark: I know they did it, Ned. The Lannisters. In my bones, I know it."
1338,Eddard Stark:  Littlefinger's right. I can't do anything without proof.
1339,Cersei Baratheon: And if you find the proof?
1340,"Eddard Stark: Then I bring it to Robert... And hope he's still the man I once knew. You watch yourself on the road, huh? That temper of yours is a dangerous thing."
1341,"Catelyn Stark: My temper? Gods be good, you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday."
1342,Eddard Stark: He still loves you.
1343,Catelyn Stark: Does he?
1344,Eddard Stark: Off with you.
1345,"NARRATOR:In the King’s chambers, he’s drinking and eating at a table."
1346,Robert Baratheon:  It's been a long time. But I still remember every face. You remember your first?
1347,"Barristan Selmy: Of course, your Grace."
1348,Robert Baratheon:  Who was it?
1349,Barristan Selmy: A Tyroshi. Never learned the name.
1350,Robert Baratheon: How'd you do it?
1351,Barristan Selmy: Lance through the heart.
1352,"Robert Baratheon: Quick one. Lucky for you. Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall. My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud. He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword. I knocked him down with the hammer. Gods, I was strong then. Caved in his breastplate. Probably shattered every rib he had. Stood over him, hammer in the air. Right before I brought it down he shouted, ""Wait! Wait!""... They never tell you how they all shit themselves. They don't put that part in the songs. Stupid boy. Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else. He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable, his sons would be ingrates, and he'd be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl. Wine! Lancel. Gods, what a stupid name. Lancel Lannister. Who named you? Some halfwit with a stutter? What are you doing?"
1353,"Lancel Lannister: It's empty, your Grace."
1354,Robert Baratheon: What do you mean it's empty?
1355,Lancel Lannister: There's no more wine.
1356,"Robert Baratheon:  Is that what empty means?! So get more. Tell your cousin to get in here. Kingslayer! Get in here. Surrounded by Lannisters. Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug, satisfied faces. It must wound your pride, huh? Standing out there like a glorified sentry. Jaime Lannister, son of the mighty Tywin... Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks. So come on. We're telling war stories. Who was your first kill, not counting old men?"
1357,Jaime Lannister: One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood.
1358,"Barristan Selmy: I was there that day. You were only a squire, 16 years old."
1359,Jaime Lannister: You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte. Best move I ever saw.
1360,"Barristan Selmy: A good fighter, Toyne, but he lacked stamina."
1361,Robert Baratheon: Your outlaw... Any last words?
1362,"Jaime Lannister: I cut his head off, so no."
1363,Robert Baratheon: What about Aerys Targaryen? What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back? I never asked. Did he call you a traitor? Did he plead for a reprieve?
1364,"Jaime Lannister: He said the same thing he'd been saying for hours... ""Burn them all."" If that's all, your Grace..."
1365,NARRATOR:Riding horseback and walking through fields.
1366,Daenerys Targaryen: : Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves?
1367,Jorah Mormont:  The Dothraki don't believe in money. Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts.
1368,Daenerys Targaryen: From whom?
1369,"Jorah Mormont:  If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching, you have two choices : pay tribute or fight. An easy choice for most. Of course, sometimes it's not enough. Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves he's given. He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly. Sometimes a Khal decides his riders haven't had a good fight in months and need the practice."
1370,NARRATOR:Daenerys sees one of the Dothraki men strike a slave with a whip for not moving fast enough.
1371,Daenerys Targaryen: Tell them all to stop.
1372,Jorah Mormont: You want the entire horde to stop? For how long?
1373,Daenerys Targaryen:  Until I command them otherwise.
1374,Jorah Mormont:  You're learning to talk like a Queen.
1375,Daenerys Targaryen: Not a Queen. A Khaleesi.
1376,NARRATOR:Daenerys dismounts her horse and walks through the field off of the path. She hears noises coming towards her and grass snapping. Her brother Viserys storms into the clearing on horseback wielding a sword.
1377,Viserys Targaryen: You dare! You give commands to me? To me? You do not command the dragon. I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. I don't take orders from savages or their sluts. Do you hear me?
1378,"NARRATOR:Viserys has his sword to Daenerys’ throat. Rakharo whips Viserys, wrapping it around his neck and yanking him to his back."
1379,"Irri: Rakharo ask if you want him dead, Khaleesi."
1380,Daenerys Targaryen:  No!
1381,"Irri: Rakharo say you should take ear, to teach respect."
1382,"Daenerys Targaryen:  Please please, don't hurt him. Tell him I don't want my brother harmed."
1383,Viserys Targaryen: Kill these Dothraki dogs! I am your King!
1384,"Jorah Mormont:  Shall we return to the Khalasar, Khaleesi?"
1385,Rakharo: You walk. to Viserys
1386,NARRATOR:Jon and Benjen looking out over the wall. Benjen saying goodbye.
1387,Benjen Stark:  I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time. I'm leaving this morning.
1388,Jon Snow: You're leaving?
1389,Benjen Stark: I'm the First Ranger. My job is out there. There have been disturbing reports.
1390,Jon Snow:  What kind of reports?
1391,Benjen Stark:  The kind I don't want to believe.
1392,Jon Snow: 'm ready. I won't let you down.
1393,"Benjen Stark: You're not going. You're no ranger, Jon."
1394,Jon Snow: But I'm better than every...
1395,"Benjen Stark: Better than no one! Here... A man gets what he earns, when he earns it. We'll speak when I return."
1396,NARRATOR:Yoren and Tyrion getting drunk on wine in a the mess hall of Castle Black.
1397,Yoren: A bear's balls.
1398,Tyrion Lannister: You're joking?
1399,"Yoren: And his brains and his guts, his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat. When you're a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago, you leave nothing for the wolves."
1400,Tyrion Lannister: And how do a bear's balls taste?
1401,"Yoren: A bit chewy. And what about you, my Lord? What's the strangest thing you've eaten?"
1402,"Tyrion Lannister:  Do Dornish girls count? So you roam the Seven Kingdoms, collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits?"
1403,Yoren: But it's not all of 'em's done bad things. Some of 'em's just poor lads looking for steady feed. Some of 'em's high-born lads looking for glory.
1404,Tyrion Lannister: They have a better chance finding feed than glory.
1405,NARRATOR:Benjen enters.
1406,"Benjen Stark: The Night's Watch is a joke to you, is it? Is that what we are, Lannister? An army of jesters in black?"
1407,"Tyrion Lannister:  You don't have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here, none of you are particularly funny."
1408,"Benjen Stark:  I hope we've provided you with some good stories to tell when you're back in King's Landing. But something to think about while you're drinking your wine down there, enjoying your brothels... Half the boys you've seen training will die north of the Wall. Might be a wilding's axe that gets them, might be sickness, might just be the cold. They die in pain. And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort."
1409,"Tyrion Lannister: Do you think I'm plump? Listen, Benjen... May I call you Benjen?"
1410,Benjen Stark: Call me what you like.
1411,Tyrion Lannister:  I'm not sure what I've done to offend you. I have great admiration for the Night's Watch. I've great admiration for you as First Ranger.
1412,"Benjen Stark: You know, my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word ""but"" really counts."
1413,"Tyrion Lannister: But... I don't believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall. I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up, our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it."
1414,"Benjen Stark:  You're right. The wildlings are no different from us. A little rougher maybe. But they're made of meat and bone. I know how to track them and I know how to kill them. It's not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights. You've never been north of the Wall, so don't tell me what's out there."
1415,"Yoren: Are you going below? Keep well, keep warm."
1416,"Benjen Stark:  Enjoy the capital, brother."
1417,Yoren: I always do.
1418,"Tyrion Lannister: I think he's starting to like me. ""Going below""?"
1419,Yoren: Into the tunnel and out the other side. He'll be north of the Wall for a month or two.
1420,Tyrion Lannister: So you're heading down to King's Landing too.
1421,Yoren: Day after tomorrow. I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons.
1422,Tyrion Lannister: Let's share the road. I could use some decent company.
1423,"Yoren: I travel a bit on the grubby side, my Lord."
1424,Tyrion Lannister:  Not this time. We'll be staying at the finest castles and inns. No one turns away a Lannister.
1425,NARRATOR:Irri is braiding Daenerys hair and teaching her Dothraki. She feels Daenerys’ breast.
1426,"Irri: Yes, Khaleesi."
1427,Daenerys Targaryen:  What are you doing?
1428,"Irri: When was last time you bleed, Khaleesi? You change, Khaleesi. It’s a blessing from the Great Stallion."
1429,NARRATOR:Jorah and Rakharo around a fire in a tent.
1430,"Jorah Mormont:  For a man on horseback, the curved blade is a good thing, easier to handle. It's a good weapon for a Dothrakan. But a man in full plate... the arakh won't get through the steel. That's where the broadsword has the advantage. Designed for piercing plate."
1431,Rakharo: Dothraki don’t wear steel dresses.
1432,Jorah Mormont: Armor.
1433,Rakharo: Armor. Armor make a man... Vroz?
1434,Jorah Mormont:  Slow.
1435,Rakharo: Slow.
1436,"Jorah Mormont: It's true, but it also keeps a man alive."
1437,Rakharo: My father taught me how to fight. He taught me that speed defeats size.
1438,Jorah Mormont:  I’ve heard that your father was a famous warrior.
1439,"Rakharo: He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo. And your father, Jorah the Andal? He was a warrior also?"
1440,Jorah Mormont: He still is. A man of great honor. And I betrayed him.
1441,Irri: The Khaleesi wants to eat something different tonight. Kill some rabbits.
1442,Rakharo: There are no rabbits.
1443,"Irri: Find some ducks, she likes ducks."
1444,"Rakharo: Have you seen any ducks, woman? No rabbits, no ducks. Do you have eyes in your head? Do you?"
1445,Irri: Dog then. I have seen many dogs.
1446,Jorah Mormont: I don't think she wants to eat dog.
1447,Irri: The Khaleesi have baby inside her. It is true. She does not bleed for two moons. Her belly start to swell.
1448,Rakharo: A blessing from the Great Stallion.
1449,Irri: She does not want to eat horse.
1450,Jorah Mormont: I'll have the boys butcher a goat for supper. I need to ride to Qohor.
1451,Rhakaro: We ride for Vaes Dothrak.
1452,Jorah Mormont: Don't worry. I'll catch you. The horde's easy to find.
1453,"NARRATOR:Back again in the courtyard of Castle Black. Jon is battling his brothers in black as Tyrion overlooks from the balcony. Jon continuing to defeat them, he begins teaching them."
1454,Jon Snow: Don't stand so still. It's harder to hit a moving target. Except for you. You move too much. I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me.
1455,NARRATOR:Tyrion reenters the hall to speak and drink with Aemon and Lord Commander.
1456,"Maester Aemon: How many winters have you seen, Lord Tyrion?"
1457,"Tyrion Lannister:  Eight... no, nine."
1458,Maester Aemon: All of them brief?
1459,"Tyrion Lannister:  They say the winter of my birth was three years long, Maester Aemon."
1460,Maester Aemon: This summer has lasted nine. But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter. The Starks are always right eventually : winter is coming. This one will be long and dark things will come with it.
1461,"Jeor Mormont: We've been capturing wildlings, more every month. They're fleeing south. The ones who flee... say they've seen the White Walkers."
1462,"Tyrion Lannister:  Yes, and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids."
1463,Jeor Mormont: One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions. He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off.
1464,Maester Aemon: The Night's Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond. And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men. There are less than a thousand of us now. We can't man the other castles on the Wall. We can't properly patrol the wilderness. We've barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed.
1465,Jeor Mormont: Your sister sits by the side of the King. Tell her we need help.
1466,"Maester Aemon: When winter does come, gods help us all if we're not ready."
1467,NARRATOR:The Khal and Daenerys are intertwined in their tent via candlelight. Daenerys surprises Drogo and speaks Dothraki to him.
1468,Daenerys Targaryen:  It’s a boy.
1469,Khal Drogo: How do you know?
1470,Daenerys Targaryen: I know.
1471,"NARRATOR:Tyrion is pissing off of the wall, when he’s done, Jon and him converse near a fire."
1472,"Jon Snow:  I'm sorry to see you leave, Lannister."
1473,Tyrion Lannister: It's either me or this cold. And it doesn't appear to be going anywhere.
1474,Jon Snow:  Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South?
1475,Tyrion Lannister:  I expect I will. Gods know there aren't many feather beds between here and King's Landing.
1476,"Jon Snow:  If you see my brother Bran, tell him I miss him. Tell him I'd visit if I could."
1477,Tyrion Lannister: Of course.
1478,Jon Snow: He'll never walk again.
1479,"Tyrion Lannister: If you're going to be a cripple, it's better to be a rich cripple. Take care, Snow."
1480,"Jon Snow: Farewell, My Lord."
1481,NARRATOR:Arya arrives to her “dance lesson” in King’s Landing.
1482,"Syrio Forel:  You are late, boy. Tomorrow you will be here at midday."
1483,Arya Stark:  Who are you?
1484,"Syrio Forel: Your dancing master, Syrio Forel."
1485,"NARRATOR:Syrio throws a wooden sword to Arya, she does not catch it, but drops it."
1486,"Syrio Forel: Tomorrow you will catch it. Now pick it up. That is not the way, boy. This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it."
1487,Arya Stark:  It's too heavy.
1488,Syrio Forel:  It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong. Just so. One hand is all that is needed. Now you are standing all wrong. Turn your body side-face. So. You are skinny. That is good. The target is smaller. Now the grip... Let me see. The grip must be delicate.
1489,Arya Stark: What if I drop it?
1490,"Syrio Forel: The steel must be part of your arm. Can you drop part of your arm? No. Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos. He knows these things. You must listen to me, boy."
1491,Arya Stark: I'm a girl.
1492,"Syrio Forel:  Boy, girl... You are a sword, that is all. That is the grip. You are not holding a battle-axe. You are holding..."
1493,Arya Stark:  A needle.
1494,"Syrio Forel: Ahhh… Just so. Now we will begin the dance. Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering. This is the Bravo's dance... The water dance. It is swift and sudden. All men are made of water, do you know this? If you pierce them, the water leaks out and they die. Now you will try to strike me."
1495,"NARRATOR:Arya takes several attempts as Syrio turns his back, defending her and disarming her constantly. She begins picking up on a few things, but still needs much work. Ned enters in the doorway and his smile turns to a grimace watching his daughter swordfight."
1496,"Syrio Forel: Up! Dead. Dead. Very dead. Come. Again, faster."
1497,"NARRATOR:Open to Bran Stark dreaming. He is in the courtyard of Winterfell shooting a bow as a raven flies in. As he approaches it, it flies into the crypt, continuously cawing. As Bran enters the crypt he makes direct eye contact with the raven and sees that it has three eyes. He wakes up. Theon enters just as he wakes up."
1498,Old Nan: The little Lord's been dreaming again.
1499,Theon Greyjoy: We have visitors.
1500,Bran Stark: I don't want to see anyone.
1501,"Theon Greyjoy: Really? If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company, I'd go mad. Anyway, you don't have a choice. Robb's waiting."
1502,Bran Stark: I don't want to go.
1503,"Theon Greyjoy: Neither do I. But Robb's Lord of Winterfell, which means I do what he says and you do what I say. Hodor! (Hodor enters, hoisting up Bran and carrying him away) Help Bran down the hall."
1504,NARRATOR:Tyrion standing in front of Robb and Maester Luwin inside the Winterfell castle.
1505,Tyrion Lannister:  I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit.
1506,Robb Stark: Any man of the Night's Watch is welcome at Winterfell.
1507,"Tyrion Lannister: Any man of the Night's Watch, but not I, eh, boy?"
1508,"Robb Stark: I'm not your boy, Lannister. I'm Lord of Winterfell while my father is away."
1509,Tyrion Lannister: Then you might learn a lord's courtesy.
1510,NARRATOR:Hodor enters carrying Bran.
1511,Tyrion Lannister: So it's true. Hello Bran. Do you remember anything about what happened?
1512,Maester Luwin: He has no memory of that day.
1513,Tyrion Lannister: Curious.
1514,Robb Stark:  Why are you here?
1515,Tyrion Lannister: Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel? My neck is beginning to hurt.
1516,"Bran Stark: Kneel, Hodor."
1517,"Tyrion Lannister: Do you like to ride, Bran?"
1518,"Bran Stark: Yes. Well, I mean I did like to."
1519,Maester Luwin: The boy has lost the use of his legs.
1520,"Tyrion Lannister: What of it? With the right horse and saddle, even a cripple can ride."
1521,Bran Stark: I'm not a cripple.
1522,Tyrion Lannister: Then I'm not a dwarf. My father will rejoice to hear it. I have a gift for you. Give that to your saddler. He'll provide the rest. You must shape the horse to the rider. Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
1523,Bran Stark: Will I really be able to ride?
1524,Tyrion Lannister:You will. On horseback you will be as tall as any of them.
1525,Robb Stark: Is this some kind of trick? Why do you want to help him?
1526,"Tyrion Lannister: I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples, bastards and broken things."
1527,Robb Stark: You've done my brother a kindness. The hospitality of Winterfell is yours.
1528,"Tyrion Lannister: Spare me your false courtesies, Lord Stark. There's a brothel outside your walls. There I'll find a bed and both of us can sleep easier."
1529,"NARRATOR:Before Tyrion exits Winterfell for the brothel, Theon sees him off in the courtyard."
1530,"Theon Greyjoy: Couldn't resist some northern ass? If you like redheads, ask for Ros."
1531,"Tyrion Lannister: Come to see me off, Greyjoy? Kind of you. Your master doesn't seem to like Lannisters."
1532,Theon Greyjoy: He's not my master.
1533,"Tyrion Lannister: No, of course not. What happened here? Where is lady Stark? Why didn't she receive me?"
1534,Theon Greyjoy: She wasn't feeling well.
1535,"Tyrion Lannister: She's not in Winterfell, is she? Where did she go?"
1536,Theon Greyjoy: My lady's whereabouts...
1537,"Tyrion Lannister: My lady? Your loyalty to your captors is touching. Tell me, how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey? I still remember seeing my father's fleet burn in Lannisport. I believe your uncles were responsible?"
1538,Theon Greyjoy: Must have been a pretty sight.
1539,"Tyrion Lannister: Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive. Yes, a great victory for your people. Shame how it all turned out."
1540,Theon Greyjoy: We were outnumbered 10 to one.
1541,"Tyrion Lannister: A stupid rebellion then. I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle. Now here you are, your enemy's squire."
1542,"Theon Greyjoy: Careful, Imp."
1543,"Tyrion Lannister: I've offended you. Forgive me, it's been a rough morning. Anyway, don't despair. I'm a constant disappointment to my own father and I've learned to live with it. Your next tumble with Ros is on me. I'll try not to wear her out."
1544,"NARRATOR:In the courtyard of Castle Black, Jon Snow is giving the group lessons in fighting. As Alliser marches in with a new recruit, Samwell Tarly."
1545,"Jon Snow: Leg, shoulder, leg. Left foot forward. Good. Now pivot as you deliver the stroke. Put all your weight behind it."
1546,Grenn: What in seven hells is that?
1547,Pyp: They'll need an eighth hell to fit him in.
1548,Alliser Thorne: Tell them your name.
1549,"Samwell Tarly: Samwell Tarly, of Horn Hill. I mean, I was of Horn Hill. I've come to take the black."
1550,Rast: Come to take the black pudding.
1551,"Alliser Thorne: Well, you couldn't be any worse than you look. See what he can do."
1552,"Samwell Tarly: I yield. Please, no more."
1553,"Alliser Thorne: On your feet. Pick up your sword. Hit him till he finds his feet. It seems they've run short of poachers and thieves down south. Now they send us squealing bloody pigs. Again, harder."
1554,Jon Snow: Enough! He yielded.
1555,"Alliser Thorne: Looks like the bastard's in love. All right then, lord Snow, you wish to defend your lady love, let's make it an exercise. You two. Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal. All you've got to do is get past the bastard."
1556,Jon Snow: Are you sure you want to do this?
1557,"NARRATOR:Alliser has the three guys attack Jon, trying to get to Sam, Jon successfully defends them all off."
1558,Grenn: No. Yield yield yield! I yield.
1559,Alliser Thorne: We're done for today. Go clean the armory. That's all you're good for.
1560,Pyp: Well fought!
1561,Grenn: Piss off.
1562,Samwell Tarly: Did he hurt you?
1563,Jon Snow:  I've had worse.
1564,Samwell Tarly: You can call me Sam... If you want. My mother calls me Sam.
1565,"Jon Snow: It's not going to get any easier, you know? You'll have to defend yourself."
1566,Grenn: Why didn't you get up and fight?
1567,Samwell Tarly: I wanted to. I just couldn't.
1568,Grenn: Why not?
1569,Samwell Tarly: I'm a coward. My father always says so.
1570,Jon Snow:  The Wall's no place for cowards.
1571,Samwell Tarly: You're right. I'm sorry. I just... Wanted to thank you.
1572,Grenn: A bloody coward. People saw us talking to him. Now they'll think we're cowards too.
1573,Pyp: You're too stupid to be a coward.
1574,Grenn: You're too stupid to be a...
1575,"Pyp: Quick now, before summer's over."
1576,Grenn: Come on here!
1577,NARRATOR:Daenerys and the horde have arrived to the Dothraki homeland.
1578,Jorah Mormont: Vaes Dothrak. The city of the horselords.
1579,Daenerys Targaryen: These are my people now. You shouldn't call them savages.
1580,"Viserys Targaryen: I'll call them what I like, because they're my people. This is my army. Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army."
1581,"Daenerys Targaryen: If my brother was given an army of Dothraki, could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms?"
1582,Jorah Mormont: The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea. They fear any water their horses can't drink.
1583,Daenerys Targaryen: But if they did?
1584,"Jorah Mormont: King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle, but the men advising him are different."
1585,Daenerys Targaryen: And you know these men?
1586,"Jorah Mormont: I fought beside them once, long ago. Now Ned Stark wants my head. He drove me from my land."
1587,Daenerys Targaryen: You sold slaves.
1588,Jorah Mormont: Aye.
1589,Daenerys Targaryen: Why?
1590,Jorah Mormont: I had no money and an expensive wife.
1591,Daenerys Targaryen: And where is she now?
1592,"Jorah Mormont: In another place, with another man."
1593,"NARRATOR:Viserys is in a tub inside of a tent, being bathed by Doreah."
1594,Doreah: Your Grace?
1595,"Viserys Targaryen: Yes, my dear?"
1596,Doreah: They call you the last dragon...
1597,Viserys Targaryen: They do.
1598,Doreah: You have dragon's blood in your veins?
1599,Viserys Targaryen: It's entirely possible.
1600,Doreah: What happened to the dragons? I was told that brave men killed them all.
1601,"Viserys Targaryen: The brave men didn't kill dragons. The brave men rode them. Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen. The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne, which the Usurper is keeping warm for me. The swords of the vanquished, a thousand of them... melted together like so many candles."
1602,Doreah: I have always wanted to see a dragon. There is nothing in the world that I would rather see.
1603,Viserys Targaryen:Really? Why dragons?
1604,"Doreah: They can fly. And wherever they are, just a few flaps of their wings and they're somewhere else... Far away. And they can kill. Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing... melted... like so many candles. Seeing a dragon would make me very happy."
1605,"Viserys Targaryen: Well, after 15 years in a pleasure house, I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy."
1606,Doreah: I was not locked in. I have seen things.
1607,Viserys Targaryen: What have you seen?
1608,Doreah: I've seen... A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass. I've seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes. And I've seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk. So... Have you seen one?
1609,Viserys Targaryen: A pirate ship?
1610,Doreah: A dragon.
1611,"Viserys Targaryen: No, the last one died many years before I was born. I'll tell you what I have seen : their skulls. They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep. When I was very young, just 3 or 4, my father used to walk me down the rows and I'd recite their names for him. When I got them all right, he'd give me a sweet. The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong. Skulls no bigger than dog skulls. But as you got closer to the Iron Throne... They got bigger and bigger and bigger. There was Ghiscar and Valryon, Vermithrax, Essovius, Archonel, Meraxes, Vhagar... And Balerion the Dread... whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one."
1612,Doreah: What happened to the skulls?
1613,"Viserys Targaryen: I don't know. The Usurper had them smashed to powder, I expect. Scattered to the wind."
1614,Doreah: That's very sad.
1615,"Viserys Targaryen: Yes, it is. What did I buy you for? To make me sad?"
1616,"Doreah: No, your Grace. To teach your sister."
1617,Viserys Targaryen: To teach my sister how to be a better lover? You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy? You pretty little idiot. Go on then. Get on with it.
1618,NARRATOR:Inside of the throne room at King’s Landing.
1619,"Septa Mordane: Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side. And one day, before too long, you will present your son to the court. All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince..."
1620,Sansa Stark: What if I have a girl?
1621,"Septa Mordane: Gods be good, you'll have boys and girls and plenty of them."
1622,Sansa Stark: What if I only have girls?
1623,Septa Mordane: I wouldn't worry about that.
1624,"Sansa Stark: Jeyne Poole's mother had five children, all of them girls."
1625,"Septa Mordane: Yes, but it's highly unlikely."
1626,Sansa Stark: But what if?
1627,"Septa Mordane: If you only had girls, I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffrey's little brother."
1628,Sansa Stark: And everyone would hate me.
1629,Septa Mordane: Nobody could ever hate you.
1630,Sansa Stark: Joffrey does.
1631,Septa Mordane: Nonsense. Why would you say such a thing? That business with the wolves? I've told you a hundred times... A direwolf is not...
1632,Sansa Stark: Please shut up about it.
1633,Septa Mordane: Do you remember your lessons? Who built the Iron Throne?
1634,Sansa Stark: Aegon the Conqueror.
1635,Septa Mordane: And who built the Red Keep?
1636,Sansa Stark: Maegor the Cruel.
1637,Septa Mordane: And how many years did it take to build...
1638,"Sansa Stark: My grandfather and uncle were murdered here, weren't they?"
1639,"Septa Mordane: They were killed on the orders of King Aerys, yes."
1640,Sansa Stark: The Mad King.
1641,Septa Mordane: Commonly known as the Mad King.
1642,Sansa Stark: Why were they killed?
1643,Septa Mordane: You should speak to your father about these matters.
1644,"Sansa Stark: I don't want to speak to my father, ever."
1645,Septa Mordane: You will find it in your heart to forgive your father.
1646,"Sansa Stark: No, I won't."
1647,NARRATOR:Small council meeting in King’s Landing.
1648,"Janos Slynt: It's the Hand's tournament that's causing all this trouble, my Lords."
1649,Eddard Stark: The King's tournament. I assure you the Hand wants no part of it.
1650,"Janos Slynt: Call it what you will, Lord Stark Ser, the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day. Last night we had a tavern riot, a brothel fire, three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters."
1651,Varys: Dreadful.
1652,"Renly Baratheon: If you can't keep the King's peace, perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can."
1653,Janos Slynt: I need more men.
1654,Eddard Stark:  You'll get 50. Lord Baelish will see it paid for.
1655,Petyr Baelish: I will?
1656,"Eddard Stark:  You found money for a champion's purse, you can find money to keep the peace. I'll also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left."
1657,"Janos Slynt: Thank you, my Lord Hand Ser. They will be put to good use."
1658,"Eddard Stark: The sooner this is over, the better."
1659,"Varys: The realm prospers from such events, my Lord. They give the great a chance at glory, and the lowly a respite from their woes."
1660,Petyr Baelish: And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bow-legged.
1661,"Eddard Stark: I'm sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket. Now... If there's nothing else, my Lords?"
1662,"NARRATOR:Eddard dismisses the council, as they are all leaving, Ned stops Pycelle."
1663,"Grand Maester Pycelle: This heat. On days like this, I envy you northerners your summer snows. Until tomorrow my Lord."
1664,Eddard Stark:  I've been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn.
1665,"Grand Maester Pycelle: Lord Arryn? His death was a great sadness to all of us. I took personal charge of his care, but I could not save him. His sickness struck him very hard and very fast. I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed. Lord Jon often came to me for counsel."
1666,Eddard Stark:  Why?
1667,Grand Maester Pycelle: I have been Grand Maester for many years. Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since...
1668,Eddard Stark:  What did Jon want the night before he died?
1669,Grand Maester Pycelle: He came inquiring after a book.
1670,Eddard Stark:  A book? What book?
1671,"Grand Maester Pycelle: I fear it would be of little interest to you, my Lord. A ponderous tome."
1672,Eddard Stark: I'd like to read it.
1673,"NARRATOR:Now in Pycelle’s room, he hands a book to Ned."
1674,"Grand Maester Pycelle: ""The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms, with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children."""
1675,"Eddard Stark:  ""Harkon Umber, first of his name, born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegon's landing, at the last hearth. Blue of eye, brown of hair and fair complected, died in his 14th year of a wound sustained"
1676,"NARRATOR:in a bear hunt."""
1677,"Grand Maester Pycelle: As I said, my Lord, a ponderous read."
1678,Eddard Stark:  Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it?
1679,"Grand Maester Pycelle: He did not, my Lord. And I did not presume to ask."
1680,Eddard Stark:  Jon's death...
1681,Grand Maester Pycelle: Such a tragedy.
1682,Eddard Stark:  Did he say anything to you during his final hours?
1683,"Grand Maester Pycelle:Nothing of import, my Lord. There was one phrase he kept repeating: ""The seed is strong,"" I think it was."
1684,"Eddard Stark:  ""The seed is strong""? What does that mean?"
1685,"Grand Maester Pycelle: The dying mind is a demented mind, Lord Stark. For all the weight they're given, last words are usually as significant as first words."
1686,Eddard Stark: And you're quite certain he died of a natural illness?
1687,Grand Maester Pycelle: What else could it be?
1688,Eddard Stark:  Poison.
1689,Grand Maester Pycelle: A disturbing thought. I don't think it likely. The Hand was loved by all. What sort of man would dare...
1690,Eddard Stark:  I've heard it said that poison is a woman's weapon.
1691,"Grand Maester Pycelle: Yes. Women, cravens... and eunuchs. Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch?"
1692,Eddard Stark:  Everybody knows that.
1693,"Grand Maester Pycelle: Yes, yes, of course. How that sort of person found himself on the King's Council, I will never know."
1694,Eddard Stark: I've taken enough of your time.
1695,"Grand Maester Pycelle: No trouble at all, my Lord. It's a great honor..."
1696,Eddard Stark:  Thank you. I'll find my own way out.
1697,NARRATOR:Ned is walking back to his chambers as he sees Arya balancing on one foot in front of a staircase.
1698,Arya Stark: Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours.
1699,Eddard Stark:  It's a hard fall down these steps.
1700,Arya Stark: Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better. Tomorrow I'm going to be chasing cats.
1701,Eddard Stark:  Cats? Syrio says…
1702,Arya Stark: He says every swordsman should study cats. They're quiet as shadows and as light as feathers. You have to be quick to catch them.
1703,Eddard Stark:  He's right about that.
1704,Arya Stark: Now that Bran's awake will he come live with us?
1705,Eddard Stark: He needs to get his strength back first.
1706,"Arya Stark:He wants to be a knight of the King’s Guard. He can't be one now, can he?"
1707,Eddard Stark: No. But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the King's Council. Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder.
1708,Arya Stark: Can I be Lord of a holdfast?
1709,Eddard Stark: You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords.
1710,Arya Stark: No. That's not me.
1711,"NARRATOR:Keeping watch on the wall, Sam joins Jon as his watch partner."
1712,"Samwell Tarly: Hello. Ser Alliser said I'm to be your new watch partner. I should warn you, I don't see all that well."
1713,Jon Snow: Come stand by the fire. It's warmer.
1714,"Samwell Tarly: No, that's all right. I'm fine."
1715,Jon Snow: You're not. You're freezing.
1716,Samwell Tarly: I don't like high places.
1717,"Jon Snow:  You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam?"
1718,"Samwell Tarly: On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. ""You're almost a man now,"" he said, ""but you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,"" he said, ""then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more."" Ser Alliser's going to make me fight again tomorrow, isn't he?"
1719,"Jon Snow:  Yes, he is."
1720,"Samwell Tarly: I'm not going to get any better, you know?"
1721,Jon Snow:  Well… You can't get any worse.
1722,NARRATOR:Walking through the gardens of King’s Landing.
1723,Petyr Baelish: I hear you're reading a boring book.
1724,Eddard Stark: Pycelle talks too much.
1725,"Petyr Baelish: He never stops. Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale? Not surprising. Until recently, he was only a squire... Jon Arryn's squire. He was knighted almost immediately after his master's untimely death."
1726,Eddard Stark:  Knighted for what? Why are you telling me this?
1727,Petyr Baelish: I promised Cat that I'd help you.
1728,Eddard Stark:  Where is Ser Hugh? I'll speak to him.
1729,Petyr Baelish: A singularly bad idea. Do you see that boy there? One of Varys's little birds. The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings. Now look there. That one belongs to the Queen. And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book?
1730,Eddard Stark: Varys or the Queen?
1731,Petyr Baelish: No. She's one of mine. Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely?
1732,Eddard Stark:  Yes.
1733,"Petyr Baelish: The wiser answer was no, my Lord. Get a message to this paragon of yours... Discreetly. Send him to question Ser Hugh. After that, you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city. He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel."
1734,Eddard Stark:  Why?
1735,"Petyr Baelish: I have my observers, as I said, and it's possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death."
1736,"Eddard Stark: Lord Baelish, perhaps I was wrong to distrust you."
1737,Petyr Baelish: Distrusting me was the wisest thing you've done since you climbed off your horse.
1738,"NARRATOR:Preparing for the Hand of the King’s tournament, Ser Hugh is pacing out steps on the joust."
1739,Jory Cassel: Ser Hugh? Ser Hugh!
1740,"Hugh of the Vale: As you can see, I'm busy."
1741,"Jory Cassel: I'm here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark, the Hand of the king. I'm the captain of his guard."
1742,"Hugh of the Vale: I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name, Ser..."
1743,"Jory Cassel: No ""ser."" I'm not a knight."
1744,"Hugh of the Vale: I see. Well, it just so happens that I am."
1745,"NARRATOR:Riding on horseback through King’s Landing, Ned and Jory arrive at the armorer."
1746,"Jory Cassel: He said he'd be glad to talk to the Hand himself. He's a knight, you see."
1747,Eddard Stark:  A knight. They strut around like roosters down here. Even the ones who've never seen an arrow coming their way.
1748,"Jory Cassel: You shouldn't be out here, my Lord. There's no telling who has eyes where."
1749,Eddard Stark: Let them look.
1750,"Tobho Mott: The former Hand did call on me, my Lord, several times. I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage."
1751,Eddard Stark:  What did Lord Arryn want?
1752,Tobho Mott: He always came to see the boy.
1753,Eddard Stark:  I'd like to see him as well.
1754,"Tobho Mott: As you wish, my Lord. Gendry! Here he is. Strong for his age. He works hard. Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad."
1755,Eddard Stark: This is fine work.
1756,Gendry: It's not for sale.
1757,"Tobho Mott: Boy, this is the King's Hand! If his lordship wants the helmet..."
1758,Gendry: I made it for me.
1759,"Tobho Mott: Forgive him, my Lord."
1760,"Eddard Stark: There's nothing to forgive. When Lord Arryn came to visit you, what would you talk about?"
1761,"Gendry: He just asked me questions is all, my Lord."
1762,Eddard Stark: What kind of questions?
1763,"Gendry: About my work at first, if I was being treated well, if I liked it here. But then he started asking me about my mother."
1764,Eddard Stark: Your mother?
1765,"Gendry: Who she was, what she looked like."
1766,Eddard Stark: What did you tell him?
1767,Gendry: She died when I was little. She had yellow hair. She'd sing to me sometimes.
1768,"Eddard Stark: Look at me. Get back to work, lad. If the day ever comes when that boy'd rather wield a sword than forge one, you send him to me."
1769,Jory Cassel: Find anything?
1770,Eddard Stark: King Robert's bastard son.
1771,NARRATOR:Jaime is standing guard outside of the king’s chambers. You can hear King Robert with numerous girls inside his room.
1772,Jory Cassel: This is for the King from Lord Stark.
1773,Jaime Lannister: Listen. Do you hear them? How many do you think are in there with him? Guess.
1774,Jory Cassel: Three? Four?
1775,Jaime Lannister:  He likes to do this when I'm on duty... He makes me listen as he insults my sister.
1776,"Jory Cassel: Forgive me, my Lord..."
1777,Jaime Lannister: Why do I have to forgive you? Have you wronged me?
1778,"Jory Cassel: We've met before, you know."
1779,"Jaime Lannister:  Have we? Strange, I've forgotten."
1780,Jory Cassel: The siege of Pyke. We fought side by side one afternoon.
1781,Jaime Lannister: That's where you got your scar?
1782,Jory Cassel: Aye. One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye.
1783,Jaime Lannister:  Vicious sons of whores.
1784,Jory Cassel: They like their bloodshed.
1785,Jaime Lannister: They stopped liking it at the end. That was a proper battle. D'you remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach?
1786,Jory Cassel: With his burning sword? I'll remember that till the day I die.
1787,Jaime Lannister:  I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell. It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop.
1788,Jory Cassel: Theon? He's a good lad.
1789,Jaime Lannister:  I doubt it.
1790,Robert Baratheon: I'll bet you smell of blackberry jam! Let me smell it. Come here.
1791,Jory Cassel: Can I leave this with you? The message from Lord Stark.
1792,Jaime Lannister: I don't serve Lord Stark.
1793,NARRATOR:In the mess hall at Castle Black.
1794,Grenn: Where have you been?
1795,Jon Snow: Watch duty. With Sam.
1796,Pyp: Prince Porkchop. Where is he?
1797,Jon Snow: He wasn't hungry.
1798,Pyp: Impossible!
1799,"Jon Snow: That's enough. Sam's no different from the rest of us. There was no place for him in the world, so he's come here. We're not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore. Never again, no matter what Thorne says. He's our brother now and we're going to protect him."
1800,"Rast: You are in love, Lord Snow. You girls can do as you please. But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy, I'm gonna slice me off a side of bacon."
1801,"NARRATOR:All of the new recruits are sleeping. Jon, Ghost (his direwolf), Pyp and Grenn ambush and gag Rast as he sleeps. Jon threatens him."
1802,Jon Snow:  No one touches Sam.
1803,NARRATOR:Back in the training yard the next morning. Rast is defying Alliser and not attacking Sam.
1804,"Alliser Thorne: What are you waiting for? Attack him! You, get in there."
1805,"Grenn: Hit me. Go on, hit me! I yield! Yield yield. I yield."
1806,"Alliser Thorne: You think this is funny, do you? When you're out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down, do you want a man at your back? Or a sniveling boy?"
1807,"NARRATOR:After their bath, Viserys drags Doreah by her hair through the camp and into Daenerys’ tent."
1808,Viserys Targaryen: You send this whore to give me commands? I should have sent you back her head!
1809,"Doreah: Forgive me, Khaleesi. I did as you asked."
1810,"Daenerys Targaryen: Hush now. It's all right. Irri, take her and leave us."
1811,"Irri: Yes, Khaleesi."
1812,Daenerys Targaryen: Why did you hit her?!
1813,Viserys Targaryen: How many times do I have to tell you? You do not command me.
1814,Daenerys Targaryen: I wasn't commanding you. I just wanted to invite you to supper.
1815,Viserys Targaryen: What's this?
1816,Daenerys Targaryen: It's a gift. I had it made for you.
1817,Viserys Targaryen: Dothraki rags? Are you going to dress me now?
1818,Daenerys Targaryen: Please.
1819,Viserys Targaryen: This stinks of manure. All of it.
1820,"Viserys Targaryen: You would turn me into one of them, wouldn't you? Next you'll want to braid my hair."
1821,Daenerys Targaryen: You've no right to a braid. You've won no victories yet.
1822,Viserys Targaryen: You do not talk back to me!
1823,"NARRATOR:Viserys hit Daenerys, as he mounts her to keep hitting her, she fends him off with a chain."
1824,Viserys Targaryen: You are a horselord's slut. And now you've woken the dragon...
1825,Daenerys Targaryen: I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki! I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me. The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands.
1826,"NARRATOR:Inside the Castle Black mess hall, cleaning up."
1827,Samwell Tarly: I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Mole's Town.
1828,Jon Snow: I wouldn't doubt it.
1829,Samwell Tarly: Don't you think it's a little bit unfair? Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side?
1830,Jon Snow:  Sally on the side?
1831,"Samwell Tarly:It's silly, isn't it? What, we can't defend the Wall unless we're celibate? It's absurd."
1832,Jon Snow: I didn't think you'd be so upset about it.
1833,Samwell Tarly:Why not? Because I'm fat? But I like girls just as much as you do. They might not like me as much. I've never... been with one. You've probably had hundreds.
1834,"Jon Snow:  As a matter of fact, I'm the same as you."
1835,Samwell Tarly: I find that hard to believe.
1836,"Jon Snow:  I came very close once. I was alone in a room with a naked girl, but..."
1837,Samwell Tarly:You didn't know where to put it?
1838,Jon Snow:  I know where to put it.
1839,Samwell Tarly:Was she... Old and ugly?
1840,Jon Snow:  Young and gorgeous. A whore named Ros.
1841,Samwell Tarly: What color hair?
1842,Jon Snow: Red.
1843,Samwell Tarly: I like red hair. And her... Her...
1844,Jon Snow:  You don't want to know.
1845,Samwell Tarly: That good?
1846,Jon Snow: Better.
1847,Samwell Tarly: Oh no. So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect...
1848,Jon Snow:  What's my name?
1849,Samwell Tarly: Jon Snow?
1850,Jon Snow:  And why is my surname Snow?
1851,Samwell Tarly: Because... You're a bastard from the north.
1852,"Jon Snow: I never met my mother. My father wouldn't even tell me her name. I don't know if she's living or dead. I don't know if she's a noblewoman or a fisherman's wife... Or a whore. So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes. But I couldn't do it. Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child, another bastard named Snow? It's not a good life for a child."
1853,Samwell Tarly: So... You didn't know where to put it?
1854,"Alliser Thorne: Enjoying yourselves? You look cold, boys."
1855,Samwell Tarly: It is a bit nippy.
1856,"Alliser Thorne: A bit nippy, yeah, by the fire, indoors. It's still summer. Do you boys even remember the last winter? How long has it been now? What, 10 years? I remember. Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell? Were there days when you just couldn't get warm, never mind how many fires your servants built?"
1857,Jon Snow: I build my own fires.
1858,"Alliser Thorne: That's admirable. I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter. It was supposed to be a two-week mission. We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch. So we went out to look for some of his men... Capture them, gather some knowledge. The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men. Harder than you'll ever be. They know their country better than we do. They knew there was a storm coming in. So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass. And we got caught in the open. Wind so strong it yanked 100-foot trees straight from the ground, roots and all. If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss, you lost a finger to the frost. And all in darkness. You don't know cold. Neither of you do. The horses died first. We didn't have enough to feed them, to keep them warm. Eating the horses was easy. But later when we started to fall... That wasn't easy. We should have had a couple of boys like you along, shouldn't we? Soft, fat boys like you. We'd have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup. Soon we'll have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Night's Watch, but you'd be fools to believe it. You're boys still. And come the winter you will die... Like flies."
1859,"NARRATOR:Inside Daenerys’ tent, speaking privately to Jorah."
1860,Daenerys Targaryen: I hit him. I hit the dragon.
1861,Jorah Mormont: Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon. Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake.
1862,Daenerys Targaryen: He is still the true King.
1863,Jorah Mormont: The truth now: do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne?
1864,Daenerys Targaryen: No. But the common people are waiting for him. Illyrio said they're sewing dragon banners and praying for his return.
1865,"Jorah Mormont: The common people pray for rain, health and a summer that never ends. They don't care what games the high Lords play."
1866,"Daenerys Targaryen:What do you pray for, Ser Jorah?"
1867,Jorah Mormont: Home.
1868,Daenerys Targaryen: I pray for home too. My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms. He couldn't lead an army even if my husband gave him one. He'll never take us home.
1869,NARRATOR:At the Hand of the King’s tournament. Baelish sees Sansa looking at Joffrey who hides his face from her.
1870,Petyr Baelish: Lover's quarrel?
1871,Sansa Stark: I'm sorry. Do I...?
1872,"Septa Mordane: Sansa dear, this is Lord Baelish. He's known..."
1873,Petyr Baelish: An old friend of the family. I've known your mother a long long time.
1874,Arya Stark: Why do they call you Littlefinger?
1875,Sansa Stark: Arya!
1876,Septa Mordane: Don't be rude!
1877,"Petyr Baelish: No, it's quite all right. When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers, so you see, it's an exceedingly clever nickname."
1878,Robert Baratheon: I've been sitting here for days! Start the damn joust before I piss myself!
1879,"NARRATOR:The competitors step forward on their horses, Baelish introduces them to Sansa."
1880,"Sansa Stark: Gods, who is that?"
1881,Petyr Baelish: Ser Gregor Clegane. They call him the Mountain. The Hound's older brother.
1882,Sansa Stark: And his opponent?
1883,Petyr Baelish: Ser Hugh of the Vale. He was Jon Arryn's squire. Look how far he's come.
1884,"Robert Baratheon: Yes, yes. Enough of the bloody pomp. Have at it!"
1885,"NARRATOR:The joust begins. The first pass takes its course with no contact. On the second pass, the Mountain’s joust strikes Ser Hugh in the neck, causing a massive splinter, and his blood gushing out. This occurs directly in front of where Sansa is sitting."
1886,"Petyr Baelish: Not what you were expecting? Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound? Lovely little tale of brotherly love. The Hound was just a pup, six years old maybe. Gregor a few years older, already a big lad, already getting a bit of a reputation. Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence. One evening... Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire... Gregor's toy, a wooden knight. Gregor never said a word, he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals. Held him there while the boy screamed, while his face melted. There aren't very many people who know that story."
1887,Sansa Stark: I won't tell anyone. I promise.
1888,"Petyr Baelish: No, please don't. If the Hound so much as heard you mention it, I'm afraid all the knights in King's Landing would not be able to save you."
1889,"NARRATOR:In Eddard’s quarters, Cersei enters."
1890,"Jory Cassel: My Lord, Her Grace the Queen."
1891,Eddard Stark: Your Grace.
1892,Cersei Baratheon: You're missing your tournament.
1893,Eddard Stark: Putting my name on it doesn't make it mine.
1894,Cersei Baratheon: I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us – the ugliness with the wolves. And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme. Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned. How is Sansa?
1895,Eddard Stark:  She likes it here.
1896,"Cersei Baratheon: The only Stark who does. Favors her mother, not much of the north in her."
1897,Eddard Stark: What are you doing here?
1898,Cersei Baratheon:  I might ask the same of you. What is it you hope to accomplish?
1899,"Eddard Stark:  The King called on me to serve him and the realm, and that's what I'll do until he tells me otherwise."
1900,"Cersei Baratheon: You can't change him. You can't help him. He'll do what he wants, which is all he's ever done. You'll try your best to pick up the pieces."
1901,"Eddard Stark:  If that's my job, then so be it."
1902,"Cersei Baratheon: You're just a soldier, aren't you? You take your orders and you carry on. I suppose it makes sense. Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow."
1903,"Eddard Stark:  I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace."
1904,Cersei Baratheon: As was I.
1905,NARRATOR:At an inn along the King’s Road. Catelyn is heading back towards Winterfell.
1906,"Marillion: Seven blessings to you, goodfolk!"
1907,Catelyn Stark: And to you.
1908,"Rodrick Cassel: Boy! Bread, meat and beer, quickly."
1909,"Marillion: Good idea, grandfather. I'm starving. A song while we wait or?"
1910,Rodrick Cassel: I'd rather throw myself down a well.
1911,"Marillion: Grandfather, may be your last chance if you're heading north. The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves!"
1912,NARRATOR:Tyrion and Yoren of the Night’s Watch enter the inn. Catelyn attempts to hide herself.
1913,"Masha Heddle: I'm sorry, my Lord, we're full up. Every room."
1914,"Tyrion Lannister: My men can sleep in the stable. As for myself, I don't require a large room."
1915,"Masha Heddle: Truly, my lord, we have nothing."
1916,Tyrion Lannister: Is there nothing I can do... to remedy this?
1917,Bronn: You can have my room.
1918,"Tyrion Lannister: There's a clever man. You can manage food, I trust? Yoren, dine with me."
1919,"Yoren: Aye, my Lord."
1920,Marillion: My Lord of Lannister! Might I entertain you while you eat? I can sing of your father's victory at King's Landing!
1921,Tyrion Lannister: Nothing would more likely ruin my supper. Lady Stark! What an unexpected pleasure. I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell.
1922,Masha Heddle: Lady Stark.
1923,"Catelyn Stark: I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here. You, Ser... Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat?"
1924,"Knight of House Whent: It is, my Lady."
1925,Catelyn Stark: And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father... Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun?
1926,Knight of House Whent: She is.
1927,Catelyn Stark: The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun. My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen.
1928,Knight of House Bracken: Our lord is honored by his trust.
1929,"Tyrion Lannister: I envy your father all his fine friends, but I don't quite see the purpose of this."
1930,"Catelyn Stark:Knight of House Frey: Lord Walder is well, my Lady. He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday. He plans to take another wife."
1931,"Catelyn Stark: This man... Came into my house as a guest and there conspired to murder my son, a boy of 10. In the name of King Robert and the good Lords you serve, I call upon you to seize him and help me return him to Winterfell to await the king's justice."
1932,NARRATOR:All of the knights draw their swords towards Tyrion.
1933,"NARRATOR:King's Landing, Ned Stark arrives at the grounds where the Tourney of the Hand will take place. He enters a tent where Ser Hugh (deceased) is being tended to, he enters to speak with Barristan."
1934,Eddard Stark: Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital?
1935,Barristan Selmy: No. I stood vigil for him myself last night. He had no one else.
1936,Eddard Stark: He'd never worn this armor before.
1937,Barristan Selmy: Bad luck for him... Going against the Mountain.
1938,Eddard Stark: Who determines the draw?
1939,"Barristan Selmy: All the knights draw straws, Lord Stark."
1940,"Eddard Stark: Aye... But who holds the straws? You've done good work, Sisters."
1941,NARRATOR:Ned and Barristan both exit the tent and begin walking.
1942,Barristan Selmy: Life is strange. Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident.
1943,"Eddard Stark: I'm glad we never met on the field, Ser Barristan... as is my wife. I don't think the widow's life would suit her."
1944,Barristan Selmy: You're too modest. I've seen you cut down a dozen great knights.
1945,Eddard Stark: My father once told me you were the best he'd ever seen. I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat.
1946,"Barristan Selmy: He was a fine man, your father. What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime."
1947,Eddard Stark: And that lad... He was a squire until a few months ago. How could he afford a new suit of armor?
1948,Barristan Selmy: Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money? I hear the King wants to joust today.
1949,Eddard Stark: Yes. That will never happen.
1950,Barristan Selmy: Robert tends to do what he wants.
1951,"Eddard Stark: If the King got what he wanted all the time, we'd still be fighting a damned rebellion."
1952,"NARRATOR:Ned separates from Barristan and enters King Robert’s tent. Lancel, Robert’s squire, is attempting to dress him in his armor."
1953,"Lancel Lannister: It's made too small, Your Grace. It won't go."
1954,Robert Baratheon: Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse. Did you know that? Look at this idiot! One ball and no brains. He can't even put a man's armor on him properly.
1955,Eddard Stark: You're too fat for your armor.
1956,"Robert Baratheon: Fat? Fat, is it? Is that how you speak to your King? That was funny, is it?"
1957,NARRATOR:Both Robert and Ned begin laughing. Lancel also starts to laugh.
1958,"Robert Baratheon: Oh, it’s funny, is it?"
1959,"Lancel Lannister: No, Your Grace."
1960,Robert Baratheon: No? You don't like the Hand's joke?
1961,Eddard Stark: You're torturing the poor boy.
1962,"Robert Baratheon: You heard the Hand. The King's too fat for his armor! Go find the breastplate stretcher, now!"
1963,NARRATOR:Lancel runs out of the tent.
1964,Eddard Stark: The breastplate stretcher?
1965,Robert Baratheon: How long before he figures it out?
1966,Eddard Stark: Maybe you should have one invented.
1967,"Robert Baratheon: All right, all right. But you watch me out there. I still know how to point a lance."
1968,Eddard Stark: You have no business jousting. Leave that for the young men.
1969,Robert Baratheon: Why? Because I'm king? Piss on that. I want to hit somebody!
1970,Eddard Stark: And who's going to hit you back?
1971,Robert Baratheon: Anybody who can. And the last man in his saddle... will be you!
1972,Eddard Stark:There's not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you.
1973,Robert Baratheon: Are you telling me those cowards would let me win?
1974,Eddard Stark: Aye.
1975,Robert Baratheon: … Drink.
1976,Eddard Stark: I'm not thirsty.
1977,Robert Baratheon: Drink. Your King commands it. Gods! Too fat for my armor.
1978,Eddard Stark: Your squire... A Lannister boy?
1979,"Robert Baratheon: Hmm... A bloody idiot... But Cersei insisted. I have Jon Arryn to thank for her. ""Cersei Lannister will make a good match"", he told me. ""You'll need her father on your side."" I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted. Enough of this! Let's go watch 'em ride. At least I can smell someone else's blood."
1980,Eddard Stark: Robert?
1981,"Robert Baratheon: What? Oh! An inspiring sight for the people, eh? Come! Bow before your King! Bow, you shits!"
1982,"NARRATOR:Now at the jousting track where there are lots of onlookers, cheering. Ser Gregor bows before the King before he and his horse take off down one lane of the track."
1983,Eddard Stark: Where's Arya
1984,Sansa Stark: At her dancing lessons. The Knight of the Flowers.
1985,"Sansa Stark: Thank you, Ser Loras."
1986,"NARRATOR:After bowing to Sansa, Loras exchanges looks with Renly Baratheon. Loras then rides and bows before the King, also taking off down the opposite track."
1987,Sansa Stark: Don't let Ser Gregor hurt him.
1988,Eddard Stark: Hey.
1989,Sansa Stark: I can't watch.
1990,NARRATOR:Behind Ned and Sansa.
1991,Petyr Baelish: 100 gold dragons on the Mountain.
1992,Renly Baratheon: I'll take that bet.
1993,Petyr Baelish: Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons? A dozen barrels of Dornish wine? Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys?
1994,Renly Baratheon: Or you could even buy a friend.
1995,Sansa Stark: He's going to die.
1996,Eddard Stark: Ser Loras rides well.
1997,NARRATOR:A trumpet is heard and both competitors race down their lanes. Loras knocks Ser Gregor off of his mount.
1998,"Renly Baratheon: Such a shame, Littlefinger. It would have been so nice for you to have a friend."
1999,"Petyr Baelish: And tell me, Lord Renly, when will you be having your friend?"
2000,"Petyr Baelish: Loras knew his mare was in heat. Quite crafty, really."
2001,Sansa Stark: Ser Loras would never do that! There's no honor in tricks.
2002,Petyr Baelish: No honor but quite a bit of gold.
2003,"NARRATOR:Gregor gets up off of the ground, shouts for his sword. His squire brings it to him and then Gregor severs his horse’s head completely off. The crowd is stunned, Gregor then attacks Loras. Knocking him off of his horse and striking him with his sword. Sandor, the Hound, runs down from the stands and fends off his brother."
2004,Robert Baratheon: Stop this madness in the name of your King!
2005,"NARRATOR:Sandor takes a bow and Gregor storms off. Loras walks up to Sandor, raising his hand in victory."
2006,"Loras Tyrell: I owe you my life, Ser."
2007,Sandor Clegane: I'm no Ser.
2008,"NARRATOR:Stopping for rest, presumed on the Kingsroad on their way to Winterfell."
2009,Catelyn Stark: Remove his hood.
2010,"Marillion: On that eve, the captive Imp down-wards from his horse did limp, no more would he preen and primp, in garb of red and gold. (singing)"
2011,Tyrion Lannister: This isn't the Kingsroad. You said we were riding for Winterfell.
2012,Catelyn Stark: I did... often and loudly.
2013,"Tyrion Lannister: Very wise. They'll be out in droves, looking for me in the wrong place. Word's probably gotten to my father by now. He'll be offering a handsome reward. Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts. Would you be so good as to untie me?"
2014,Catelyn Stark: And why would I do that?
2015,Tyrion Lannister: Why not? Am I going to run? The hill tribes would kill me for my boots. Unless a Shadowcat ate me first.
2016,Catelyn Stark: Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns.
2017,"Tyrion Lannister: Ah... the Eastern Road. We're going to The Vale. You're taking me to your sister's to answer for my imagined crimes. Tell me, Lady Stark. When was the last time you saw your sister?"
2018,Catelyn Stark: Five years ago.
2019,"Tyrion Lannister: She's changed. She was always a bit touched, but now... you might as well kill me here."
2020,"Catelyn Stark: I am not a murderer, Lannister."
2021,Tyrion Lannister: Neither am I! I had nothing to do with the attempt on your son's life!
2022,Catelyn Stark: The dagger found
2023,Tyrion Lannister: What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade?
2024,Rodrik Cassel: Should I gag him?
2025,Tyrion Lannister: Why? Am I starting to make sense?
2026,"Rodrik Cassel: My Lady, this way."
2027,"NARRATOR:A rock slams into one of Catelyn’s men, a hill tribe begins to attack. Rodrik moves Catelyn behind a rock, out of harms way. The men, mainly Bronn begin successfully defending against the tribe. Tyrion sees Catelyn pull out a small dagger, he runs over to her and convinces her to cut him loose."
2028,"Tyrion Lannister: Untie me. If I die, what's the point?"
2029,"NARRATOR:Tyrion, now loose, runs over and picks up a shield. He fends off an attack as another of Lady Stark’s men kills him. Another tribesman is nearing Catelyn, Tyrion rushes over with his shield, knocks him to the ground and begins slamming it into his throat, directly in front of, and in defense of Catelyn. The battle comes to an end with many of their men defeated."
2030,Catelyn Stark: Rodrik?
2031,"Rodrik Cassel: I'll be fine, my Lady. There's no need to bloody yourself."
2032,Bronn:  Your first? You need a woman. Nothing like a woman after a fight.
2033,"Tyrion Lannister: Well, I'm willing if she is."
2034,"NARRATOR:Back at Winterfell, Maester Luwin and Bran are at a small table, Luwin trying to teach Bran. Bran is fixed on watching Theon as he is practicing his archery."
2035,Maester Luwin: Bran...
2036,Maester Luwin: Lords?
2037,Bran Stark: The Greyjoys.
2038,"Theon Greyjoy: Famed for their skills at archery, navigation and lovemaking."
2039,Maester Luwin: And failed rebellions.
2040,Maester Luwin: Good.
2041,Maester Luwin:: Mhmm.
2042,Maester Luwin: Hmm...
2043,"Maester Luwin: No. A common saying, but not their official motto."
2044,Maester Luwin: We're still on their words.
2045,Bran Stark: I don't know them.
2046,Maester Luwin: You do know them. Think.
2047,"Bran Stark: ""Unbowed, unbent, unbroken""."
2048,Maester Luwin:That's House Martell.
2049,"Bran Stark: ""Righteous in wrath""."
2050,Maester Luwin: House Hornwood.
2051,"Bran Stark: ""Family, duty, honor""."
2052,Maester Luwin:Those are Tully words... Your mother's. Are we playing a game?
2053,"Bran Stark: ""Family, duty, honor""... Is that the right order?"
2054,Maester Luwin:You know it is.
2055,Bran Stark: Family comes first?
2056,Maester Luwin: Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family.
2057,"Bran Stark: How can she protect the family, if she's not with her family?"
2058,Maester Luwin: Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept.
2059,Bran Stark: And then she left!
2060,"Maester Luwin: When you were born, I was the one who pulled you from your mother. I placed you in her arms. From that moment until the moment she dies, she will love you. Absolutely. Fiercely."
2061,Bran Stark: Why did she leave?
2062,"Maester Luwin: I still can't tell you, but she will be home soon."
2063,Bran Stark: Do you know where she is now? Today?
2064,"Maester Luwin:No, I don't."
2065,Bran Stark: Then how can you promise me she'll be home soon?
2066,Maester Luwin: Sometimes I worry you're too smart for your own good.
2067,Bran Stark: I'll never shoot another arrow.
2068,Maester Luwin: And where is that written?
2069,Bran Stark: You need legs to work a bow.
2070,"Maester Luwin: Hmm... If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works, you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback."
2071,Bran Stark: Really?
2072,Maester Luwin: Dothraki boys learn when they're four years old. Why shouldn't you?
2073,"NARRATOR:Now in Theon’s quarters inside Winterfell, he’s making love to Ros."
2074,Theon Greyjoy: Shh... Keep it down. You're not supposed to be inside the castle walls.
2075,NARRATOR:They break.
2076,Ros: I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here.
2077,Theon Greyjoy: Important enough for the likes of you.
2078,"Ros: You're not the only nobleman in my life, you know."
2079,Theon Greyjoy: Who? the Imp? I'd call him half a nobleman.
2080,Ros: Jealous?
2081,Theon Greyjoy: Why should I be jealous?
2082,Theon Greyjoy: Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night. What's a dwarf like down below? I've always wondered.
2083,Ros: Might surprise you.
2084,Theon Greyjoy: Hmm?
2085,Ros: He's good with his fingers too. And his tongue.
2086,Theon Greyjoy: Generous tipper. I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister.
2087,Ros: You are jealous.
2088,"Theon Greyjoy: I'm a Greyjoy. We've been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years. There's not a family in Westeros that can look down on us, not even the Lannisters."
2089,Ros: And what about the Starks?
2090,Theon Greyjoy: I’ve been Lord Stark’s ward since I was eight years old.
2091,"Ros: A “ward”, that’s a nice word for it. Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again…"
2092,NARRATOR:Theon grabs Ros’ neck from behind.
2093,Theon Greyjoy: My father fought for the freedom of his people! What did your father do? Fucked a cook and whelped a whore.
2094,Ros: You’re a very serious boy.
2095,Theon Greyjoy: I’m not a boy.
2096,"Ros: Oh, yes you are. A serious boy, with a serious cock."
2097,Theon Greyjoy: I don’t want to pay for it.
2098,Ros: Then get yourself a wife.
2099,"NARRATOR:Arya, at King’s Landing is running through the halls chasing a cat. She’s seen running down a hallway."
2100,Arya Stark: Come on. I'm not gonna hurt you.
2101,"NARRATOR:Ned is in his chambers at his desk, Varys is speaking to him, walking around securing all of the windows before sitting down to talk more seriously."
2102,"Varys: How is your son, my Lord?"
2103,Eddard Stark: He'll never walk again.
2104,Varys: But his mind is sound?
2105,Eddard Stark: So they say.
2106,Varys:A blessing then. I suffered an early mutilation myself. Some doors close forever... others open in the most unexpected places. May I?
2107,"Varys: If the wrong ears heard what I'm about to tell you, off comes my head. And who would mourn poor Varys then? North or South, they sing no songs for spiders. But there are things you must know. You are the King's Hand and the King is a fool... your friend, I know, but a fool... and doomed unless you save him."
2108,Eddard Stark: I've been in the capital a month. Why have you waited so long to tell me this?
2109,Varys: I didn't trust you.
2110,Eddard Stark: So why do you trust me now?
2111,"Varys: The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely. There are few men of honor in the capital. You are one of them. I would like to believe I am another, strange as that may seem."
2112,Eddard Stark: What sort of doom does the King face?
2113,"Varys: The same sort as Jon Arryn. The tears of Lys, they call it. A rare and costly thing, as clear and tasteless as water. It leaves no trace."
2114,Eddard Stark: Who gave it to him?
2115,"Varys: Some dear friend, no doubt. But which one? There were many. Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man. There was one boy... all he was he owed to Jon Arryn."
2116,"Eddard Stark: The squire, Ser Hugh?"
2117,"Varys: Pity what happened to him, just when his life seemed to be going so nicely."
2118,"Eddard Stark: If Ser Hugh poisoned him, who paid Ser Hugh?"
2119,Varys: Someone who could afford it.
2120,Varys: He started asking questions.
2121,"NARRATOR:We shift to a dark dungeon of King’s Landing. Arya is still chasing the cat. She stops to admire a large dragon’s skull. She hears two men talking, and hides from them, just in earshot. The two men are Lord Varys and Magister Illyrio Mopatis."
2122,Varys: He's found one bastard already. He has the book. The rest will come.
2123,"Illyrio Mopatis: And when he knows the truth, what will he do?"
2124,"Varys: The gods alone know. The fools tried to kill his son. What's worse, they botched it. The wolf and the lion will be at each other's throats. We will be at war soon, my friend."
2125,"Illyrio Mopatis: What good is war now? We're not ready. If one Hand can die, why not a second?"
2126,Varys: This Hand is not the other.
2127,Illyrio Mopatis: We need time. Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born. You know how these savages are.
2128,"Varys: ""Delay,"" you say. ""Move fast, "" I reply. This is no longer a game for two players."
2129,Illyrio Mopatis: It never was.
2130,"NARRATOR:The two men leave, Varys locks a gate behind them. Arya runs to the gate and can’t get out. She takes off in the other direction, deeper into the dungeon, to find an exit."
2131,"NARRATOR:Varys enters the Throne Room, where Baelish is standing, looking at the throne."
2132,Varys: The first to arrive and the last to leave. I admire your industry.
2133,Petyr Baelish: You do move quietly.
2134,Varys: We all have our qualities.
2135,Petyr Baelish: You look a bit lonely today. You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening. First boy is on the house.
2136,Varys: I think you're mistaking business with pleasure.
2137,"Petyr Baelish: Am I? All those birds that whisper in your ear, such pretty little things. Trust me, we accommodate all inclinations."
2138,"Varys: Oh, I'm sure. Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young, I hear."
2139,"Petyr Baelish: I'm a purveyor of beauty and discretion, both equally important."
2140,"Varys: Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality, no? Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees?"
2141,Petyr Baelish: All desires are valid to a man with a full purse.
2142,Varys: And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers. Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination. The logistics alone... to find beautiful corpses before they rot.
2143,"Petyr Baelish: Strictly speaking, such a thing would not be in accordance with the King's laws."
2144,Varys: Strictly speaking.
2145,"Petyr Baelish: Tell me. Does someone, somewhere, keep your balls in a little box? I've often wondered."
2146,"Varys: Do you know, I have no idea where they are? And we had been so close. But enough about me. How have you been since we last saw each other?"
2147,Petyr Baelish: Since you last saw me or since I last saw you?
2148,"Varys: Now the last time I saw you, you were talking to the Hand of the King."
2149,Petyr Baelish: Saw me with your own eyes?
2150,Varys: Eyes I own.
2151,Petyr Baelish: Council business. We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark.
2152,Varys: Everyone's well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Stark's wife. If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boy's life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion... To think... A simple word to the Queen...
2153,Petyr Baelish: One shudders at the thought.
2154,Varys: Oh.
2155,Petyr Baelish: But you know something? I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me.
2156,Varys: Have you?
2157,"Petyr Baelish: Yes. Earlier today, I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers."
2158,Varys: Was that you under the bed?
2159,"Petyr Baelish: And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary... Council business? Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea. You're from there yourself, after all. We're friends, aren't we, Lord Varys? I'd like to think we are. So you can imagine my burden, wondering if the King might question my friend's sympathies… To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend, turning right, loyalty to the realm."
2160,"Varys: Oh, please."
2161,Petyr Baelish: To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King --
2162,NARRATOR:Renly enters from a different doorway and cuts both men off.
2163,"Renly Baratheon: What are you two conspiring about? Well, whatever it is, you'd best hurry up. My brother is coming."
2164,Petyr Baelish: To a small council meeting?
2165,Varys: Disturbing news from far away. Haven't you heard?
2166,"NARRATOR:Arya exits a tunnel outside of King’s Landing, at the beach of Blackwater Bay. She heads to the city’s gate but is stopped by two guards."
2167,Guard 1: Off with you. No begging.
2168,Arya Stark: I'm not a beggar. I live here.
2169,Guard 1: D'you want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing?
2170,Arya Stark: I want to see my father.
2171,"Guard 2: I want to fuck the Queen, for all the good it does me."
2172,"Guard 1: You want your father, boy? He's lying on the floor of some tavern, getting pissed on by his friends."
2173,"Arya Stark: My father is Hand of the King! I'm not a boy. I'm Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me, my father will have both your heads on spikes! Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing?"
2174,NARRATOR:Quick cut to Arya standing in front of Ned at his desk.
2175,Eddard Stark: You know I had half my guard out searching for you? You promised me this would stop.
2176,Arya Stark: They said they were going to kill you.
2177,Eddard Stark: Who did?
2178,"Arya Stark: I didn't see them, but I think one was fat."
2179,"Eddard Stark: Oh, Arya."
2180,Arya Stark: I'm not lying! They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage... something about the savage.
2181,Eddard Stark: Where did you hear this?
2182,"Arya Stark: In the dungeons, near the dragon skulls."
2183,Eddard Stark: What were you doing in the dungeons?
2184,Arya Stark: Chasing a cat.
2185,"NARRATOR:A knock at the door, Jory pokes his head in."
2186,"Jory Cassel: Pardon, my Lord. There's a Night's Watchman here begging a word. He says it's urgent."
2187,"Eddard Stark: Your name, friend?"
2188,"Yoren: Yoren, if it please. This must be your son. He has the look."
2189,Arya Stark: I'm a girl!
2190,Eddard Stark: Did Benjen send you?
2191,"Yoren: No one sent me, my Lord. I'm here to find men for The Wall, see if there's any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service."
2192,"Eddard Stark: Ah, we'll find recruits for you."
2193,"Yoren: Thank you, my Lord. But that's not why I disturb you now. Your brother, Benjen... his blood runs black, makes him as much my brother as yours. It's for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse! There are others riding too. The whole city will know by tomorrow."
2194,Eddard Stark: Know what?
2195,"Yoren: Best said in private, my Lord."
2196,Eddard Stark: Go on. We'll talk more later.
2197,"Eddard Stark: Jory, take her safely to her room."
2198,"Jory Cassel: Come along, my Lady. You heard your father."
2199,NARRATOR:Jory escorts Arya to her room.
2200,Arya Stark: How many guards does my father have?
2201,Jory Cassel: Here in King's Landing? Fifty.
2202,"Arya Stark: You wouldn't let anyone kill him, would you?"
2203,"Jory Cassel: No fear on that count, little Lady."
2204,NARRATOR:Ned and Yoren are now alone in Ned’s chambers.
2205,Eddard Stark: Well?
2206,"Yoren: It's about your wife, my Lord. She's taken the Imp."
2207,"NARRATOR:As Catelyn, Tyrion and her men are arriving to the Vale, they’re met by a group of guards."
2208,"Vardis Egen: You're far from home, Lady Stark."
2209,Catelyn Stark: To whom do I speak?
2210,"Vardis Egen: Ser Vardis Egen, Knight of The Vale. Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit?"
2211,Catelyn Stark: There was no time to send word.
2212,"Vardis Egen: May I ask, my Lady, why he is with you?"
2213,Catelyn Stark: That's why there was no time. He is my prisoner.
2214,Vardis Egen: He doesn't look like a prisoner.
2215,Catelyn Stark: My sister will decide what he looks like.
2216,"Vardis Egen: Yes, my Lady. She will at that."
2217,NARRATOR:The guards all turn their horses and escort Catelyn and her men towards the Eyrie.
2218,Tyrion Lannister: The Eyrie. They say it's impregnable.
2219,Bronn: Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes... I'll impregnate the bitch.
2220,Tyrion Lannister: I like you.
2221,"NARRATOR:Ned is walking through a courtyard at King’s Landing, heading for the King Robert’s chambers. He is stopped by a royal steward."
2222,"Steward: Lord Stark, your presence has been requested in the small council chamber. A meeting has been called."
2223,"Steward: The King is at the small council meeting, my Lord. He has summoned you."
2224,Eddard Stark: Is it about my wife?
2225,"Steward: No, my Lord. I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen."
2226,"NARRATOR:Now at the small council meeting with everyone on the council, as well as King Robert."
2227,Robert Baratheon: The whore is pregnant.
2228,Eddard Stark: You're speaking of murdering a child.
2229,"Robert Baratheon: I warned you this would happen. Back in the North, I warned you, but you didn't care to hear. Well, hear it now. I want 'em dead, mother and child both. And that fool, Viserys as well. Is that plain enough for you? I want them both dead."
2230,Eddard Stark: You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this.
2231,"Robert Baratheon: Honor?! I've got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms. Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it's honor that's keeping the peace? It's fear! Fear and blood!"
2232,Eddard Stark: Then we're no better than the Mad King.
2233,"Robert Baratheon: Careful, Ned. Careful now."
2234,Eddard Stark: You want to assassinate a girl... Because the Spider heard a rumor?
2235,"Varys: No rumor, my Lord. The princess is with child."
2236,Eddard Stark: Based on whose information?
2237,Varys: Ser Jorah Mormont. He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens.
2238,Eddard Stark: Mormont? You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact?
2239,"Petyr Baelish: Jorah Mormont's a slaver, not a traitor. Small difference, I know, to an honorable man."
2240,"Eddard Stark: He broke the law, betrayed his family, fled our land. We commit murder on the word of this man?"
2241,Robert Baratheon: And if he's right? If she has a son? A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army… What then?
2242,Eddard Stark: The Narrow Sea still lies between us. I'll fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water.
2243,Robert Baratheon: Do nothing? That's your wise advice? Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores? You're my council? Counsel! Speak sense to this honorable fool.
2244,"Varys: I understand your misgivings, my Lord. Truly, I do. It is a terrible thing we must consider, a vile thing. Yet, we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm. Should the gods grant Daenerys a son, the realm will bleed."
2245,"Grand Maester Pycelle: I bear this girl no ill will, but should the Dothraki invade, how many innocents will die? How many towns will burn? Is it not wiser, kinder even, that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live?"
2246,Renly Baratheon: We should have had them both killed years ago.
2247,"Petyr Baelish: When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman, best close your eyes, get it over with. Cut her throat. Be done with it."
2248,Robert Baratheon: She dies.
2249,Eddard Stark: I will have no part in it.
2250,"Robert Baratheon: You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark. You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will."
2251,NARRATOR:Ned removes his badge and places it on the table in front of Robert.
2252,Eddard Stark: And good luck to him. I thought you were a better man.
2253,"Robert Baratheon: Out! Out, damn you! I'm done with you. Go! Run back to Winterfell! I'll have your head on a spike! I'll put it there myself, you fool! You think you're too good for this? Too proud and honorable? This is a war!"
2254,NARRATOR:Ned is in his chambers quickly packing his things.
2255,Eddard Stark: I'll go ahead with my daughters. Get them ready. Do it yourself. Don't ask anyone for help.
2256,"Jory Cassel: Right away, my Lord. Lord Baelish is here for you."
2257,"Petyr Baelish: His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave. The word ""treason"" was mentioned."
2258,Eddard Stark: What can I do for you?
2259,Petyr Baelish: When do you return to Winterfell?
2260,Eddard Stark: Why? What do you care?
2261,"Petyr Baelish: If you're still here come nightfall, I'll take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill. If that sort of thing still interests you."
2262,Eddard Stark: I don't have the time.
2263,Petyr Baelish: It won't take more than an hour. But as you please.
2264,"NARRATOR:Baelish exits Ned’s chambers, Ned speaks to Jory briefly and then takes off for Baelish."
2265,Eddard Stark: Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls' chambers. Who are your best two swords?
2266,Jory Cassel: Heward and Wyl.
2267,Eddard Stark: Find them and meet me at the stables.
2268,"NARRATOR:At the Eyrie, Catelyn, her men, and Tyrion are all standing in front of Lady Arryn. Her son is sitting on her lap, breastfeeding. He is clearly too old to be doing so."
2269,"Lysa Arryn: You bring him here without permission? You pollute my home with his presence? Your aunt has done a bad thing, Robin, a very bad thing. You remember her, don't you? Isn't he beautiful? And strong too. Jon knew it. His last words were, ""the seed is strong."" He wanted everyone to know what a good, strong boy his son would grow up to be. Look at him, the Lord of all the Vale."
2270,"Catelyn Stark: Lysa, you wrote me about the Lannisters, warning me t-"
2271,Lysa Arryn: To stay away from them! Not to bring one here!
2272,Robin Arryn: Mommy? Is that the bad man?
2273,Lysa Arryn: It is.
2274,Robin Arryn: He's little.
2275,Lysa Arryn: He's Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister. He killed your father. He murdered the Hand of the King!
2276,Tyrion Lannister: Oh? Did I kill him too? I've been a very busy man.
2277,Lysa Arryn: You will watch your tongue! These men are Knights of the Vale. Every one of the loved Jon Arryn. Every one of them would die for me.
2278,"Tyrion Lannister: If any harm comes to me, my brother, Jaime, will see that they do."
2279,"Robin Arryn: You can't hurt us! No one can hurt us here! Tell him, mommy! Tell him!"
2280,"Lysa Arryn: Shh... Shh... Shh, my sweet boy. He's just trying to frighten us. Lannisters are all liars. No one will hurt my baby."
2281,Robin Arryn: Mommy... I want to see the bad man fly.
2282,"Lysa Arryn: Perhaps you will, my little love."
2283,Catelyn Stark: This man is my prisoner. I will not have him harmed.
2284,"Lysa Arryn: Ser Vardis, my sister's guest is weary. Take him down below so he can rest. Introduce him to Mord."
2285,NARRATOR:Mord throws Tyrion into a “skycell.”
2286,"Mord: You go sleep, dwarf man. Sleep good, little dwarf. man!"
2287,"NARRATOR:Back at King’s Landing, inside Renly Baratheon’s chambers. He is sitting, shirtless, with Loras Tyrell kneeling beside him shaving his chest. Loras is also shirtless."
2288,Loras Tyrell: Lord Stark's lucky he still has a head.
2289,"Renly Baratheon: Robert will rant for a few days, but he won't do anything. He adores the man."
2290,Loras Tyrell: You're jealous.
2291,Renly Baratheon: Are you sure this won't hurt?
2292,Loras Tyrell: Only if I slip.
2293,Renly Baratheon: And you prefer me like this?
2294,Loras Tyrell: Mhmm.
2295,"Renly Baratheon: If you want hairless, maybe you should find a little boy."
2296,Loras Tyrell: I want you.
2297,"Renly Baratheon: My brother thinks that anyone who hasn't been to war isn't a man. He treats me as if I'm a spoiled child. Oh, and you're not? Loras Tyrell, the Knight of the Flowers? How many wars have you fought in? Oh, and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours?"
2298,Loras Tyrell: Hold still.
2299,"Renly Baratheon: All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how I'm not tough enough, how I squirm at the sight of blood."
2300,Loras Tyrell: You did vomit when that boy's eye was knocked out in the mêlée.
2301,Renly Baratheon:His eye was dangling out of the damn socket!
2302,Loras Tyrell: He shouldn't have entered the mêlée if he didn't know how to fight.
2303,Renly Baratheon: Easy for you to say. Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman.
2304,"Renly Baratheon: I could work at fighting all day, every day, and still never be as good as you."
2305,"Loras Tyrell: Yes well, I guess we'll never know."
2306,"NARRATOR:Finished with Renly’s chest, Loras raises his arm so he can shave his armpit."
2307,Renly Baratheon: Everywhere?
2308,Loras Tyrell: Everywhere. So how did it end up? The Targaryen girl will die?
2309,"Renly Baratheon: It needs to be done, unpleasant as it is. Robert's rather tasteless about it. Every time he talks about killing her, I swear the table rises six inches."
2310,Loras Tyrell: It's a shame he can't muster the same enthusiasm for his wife.
2311,"Renly Baratheon: He does have a deep, abiding lust for her money. You have to give it to the Lannisters, they may be the most pompous, ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world, but they do have outrageous amounts of money."
2312,Loras Tyrell: I have an outrageous amount of money.
2313,Renly Baratheon: Not as much as the Lannisters.
2314,Loras Tyrell: But a lot more than you.
2315,"Renly Baratheon: Robert's threatening to take me hunting with him. Last time we were out there for two weeks, tramping through the trees in the rain, day after day. All so he can stick his spear into something's flesh! Oh. but Robert loves his killing. And he's the King."
2316,Loras Tyrell: Hmm... How did that ever happen?
2317,Renly Baratheon: Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it.
2318,Loras Tyrell: Do you know who should be King?
2319,Renly Baratheon: Be serious.
2320,"Loras Tyrell: I am. My father could be your bank. I've never fought in a war before, but I'd fight for you."
2321,Renly Baratheon: I'm fourth in line.
2322,Loras Tyrell: And where was Robert in the line of royal succession? Joffrey is a monster. Tommen is eight.
2323,Renly Baratheon: Stannis?
2324,Loras Tyrell: Stannis has the personality of a lobster.
2325,Renly Baratheon: He's still my older brother.
2326,NARRATOR:Loras cuts Renly under his arm.
2327,Renly Baratheon: What are you doing?!
2328,Loras Tyrell: Look at it.
2329,Renly Baratheon: You cut me!
2330,"Loras Tyrell: It's just blood. We've all got it in us. Sometimes a little spills. If you become King, you're going to see a lot of this. You need to get used to it. Go on. Look. People love you. They love to serve you because you're kind to them. They want to be near you."
2331,"Loras Tyrell: You're willing to do what needs to be done, but you don't gloat over it. You don't love killing. Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst? That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared. You would be a wonderful King."
2332,NARRATOR:Cersei enters King Robert’s chambers.
2333,Cersei Baratheon: I'm sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didn't work out. You seemed so good together.
2334,Robert Baratheon: I'm glad I could do something to make you happy.
2335,"Cersei Baratheon: Without a Hand, everything will fall to pieces."
2336,Robert Baratheon: I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime.
2337,"Robert Baratheon: I don't know. But I do know this, if the Targaryen girl convinces her horse-lord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea... We won't be able to stop them."
2338,Cersei Baratheon: The Dothraki don't sail. Every child knows that. They don't have discipline. They don't have armor. They don't have siege weapons.
2339,"Robert Baratheon: It's a neat little trick you do, you move your lips and your father's voice comes out."
2340,Cersei Baratheon: Is my father wrong?
2341,"Robert Baratheon: Let's say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back. We hole up in our castles, a wise move. Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field. They leave us in our castles. They go from town to town, looting and burning, killing every man who can't hide behind a stone wall, stealing all our crops and livestock, enslaving all our women and children. How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King, their cowardly King hiding behind high walls? When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all."
2342,Cersei Baratheon: We still outnumber them.
2343,Cersei Baratheon: Five.
2344,"Robert Baratheon: Five... one. One army, a real army, united behind one leader with one purpose. Our purpose died with the Mad King. Now we've got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse. And everybody wants something different. Your father wants to own the world. Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow."
2345,Cersei Baratheon: What do you want?
2346,"Robert Baratheon: We haven't had a real fight in nine years. Back-stabbing doesn't prepare you for a fight. And that's all the realm is now, back-stabbing and scheming and arse-licking and money-grubbing. Sometimes I don't know what holds it together."
2347,Cersei Baratheon: Our marriage.
2348,NARRATOR:The two begin laughing.
2349,"Robert Baratheon: Ah, so here we sit, seventeen years later, holding it all together. Don't you get tired?"
2350,Cersei Baratheon: Every day.
2351,Robert Baratheon: How long can hate hold a thing together?
2352,"Cersei Baratheon: Well, seventeen years is quite a long time."
2353,"Robert Baratheon: Yes, it is."
2354,"Cersei Baratheon: Yes, it tis. What was she like?"
2355,"Robert Baratheon: You've never asked about her, not once. Why not?"
2356,"Cersei Baratheon: At first, just saying her name, even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her. I thought if I didn't talk about her, she'd just fade away for you. When I realized that wasn't going to happen, I refused to ask out of spite. I didn't want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask. And eventually it became clear that my spite didn't mean anything to you, as far as I could tell, you actually enjoyed it."
2357,Robert Baratheon: So why now?
2358,Cersei Baratheon: What harm could Lyanna Stark's ghost do to either of us that we haven't done to each other a hundred times over?
2359,"Robert Baratheon: You want to know the horrible truth? I can't even remember what she looked like. I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted... Someone took her away from me, and Seven Kingdoms couldn't fill the hole she left behind."
2360,"Cersei Baratheon: I felt something for you once, you know?"
2361,Robert Baratheon: I know.
2362,Robert Baratheon: No. Does that make you feel better or worse?
2363,Cersei Baratheon: It doesn't make me feel anything.
2364,"NARRATOR:Inside one of Baelish’s brothels, Ned is speaking to one of the prostitutes. Jory and Baelish are in the next room."
2365,"Mhaegen: She looks like him, don't she, my Lord? She has his nose, his black hair."
2366,Eddard Stark: Aye.
2367,"Mhaegen: Tell him when you see him, my Lord. If it please you... Tell him how beautiful she is."
2368,Eddard Stark: I will.
2369,"Mhaegen: And tell him I've been with no one else. I swear it, my Lord, by the old gods and new. I don't want no jewels or nothing, just him. The King was always good to me."
2370,"Eddard Stark: When Jon Arryn came to visit you, what did he want?"
2371,"Mhaegen: He wasn't that sort of man, my Lord. He just wanted to know if the child was happy, healthy."
2372,Eddard Stark: She looks healthy enough to me. The girl shall want for nothing.
2373,NARRATOR:Ned breaks off from Mhaegen and enters the same room as Baelish and Jory.
2374,"Petyr Baelish: Brothels make a much better investment than ship, I've found. Whores rarely sink."
2375,Eddard Stark: What do you know of King Robert's bastards?
2376,"Petyr Baelish: Well, he has more than you, for a start."
2377,Eddard Stark: How many?
2378,"Petyr Baelish: Does it matter? If you fuck enough women, some of them will give you presents."
2379,Eddard Stark: And Jon Arryn tracked them all down. Why?
2380,Petyr Baelish: He was the King's Hand. Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after. He was overcome with fatherly love.
2381,Eddard Stark: Come.
2382,"NARRATOR:Jory is staring at one of the whores, who flashes him her breast."
2383,Eddard Stark: Jory!
2384,Jory Cassel: My Lord.
2385,NARRATOR:Ned and Jory leave the brothel with a few of Ned’s men. They are suddenly surround by Jaime Lannister and his men.
2386,Jaime Lannister: Such a small pack of wolves.
2387,"Jory Cassel: Stay back, Ser! This is the Hand of the King!"
2388,Jaime Lannister: Was!... the Hand of the King. Now I'm not sure what he is... Lord of somewhere very far away.
2389,"Petyr Baelish: What's the meaning of this, Lannister?"
2390,"Jaime Lannister: Get back inside where it's safe. I'm looking for my brother. You remember my brother, don't you, Lord Stark? Blond hair, sharp tongue, short man."
2391,Eddard Stark: I remember him well.
2392,"Jaime Lannister: It seems he had some trouble on the road. You wouldn't know what happened to him, would you?"
2393,Eddard Stark:He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes.
2394,"NARRATOR:Jaime draws his sword, causing all of them men on both sides to draw their swords, except for Eddard."
2395,Petyr Baelish: My Lords! I'll bring the City Watch!
2396,"Jaime Lannister: Come, Stark. I'd rather you die sword in hand."
2397,Jory Cassel: If you threaten my Lord again...
2398,"Jaime Lannister: Threaten? As in, ""I'm going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of”?"
2399,"Eddard Stark: You kill me, your brother's a dead man."
2400,Jaime Lannister: You're right. Take him alive! Kill his men!
2401,"NARRATOR:A fight erupts, first Jaime’s men throw spears straight into the chests of two of Ned’s men. Ned draws his sword and moves towards Jaime, fending off several guards in the process. Jory gets to Jaime first. Jaime stabs Jory with a dagger straight through his eye. The fighting ceases and Ned moves forward to Jaime, Jaime’s men all stop to watch the fight. The two fend each other off, as they break, one of Jaime’s guards stabs Ned in the back of the leg with a spear, causing him to fall to the ground. Jaime is openly frustrated and knocks the guard out. He mounts his horse."
2402,"Jaime Lannister: My brother, Lord Stark... We want him back."
2403,NARRATOR:Jaime rides off on horseback and his guards follow suit.
2404,"NARRATOR:Opens at King’s Landing, assumed to be Ned’s quarters. He opens his eyes to find Cersei and King Robert at his bedside."
2405,"Eddard Stark: Your pardon, your Grace."
2406,Cersei Baratheon: Do you know what your wife has done?
2407,Eddard Stark:  She did nothing I did not command.
2408,Robert Baratheon: Who’d have thought she had it in her?
2409,Cersei Baratheon: By what right dare you lay hands on my blood?
2410,Eddard Stark:  I am the King’s Hand -
2411,Cersei Baratheon: You were the King’s Hand!
2412,Cersei Baratheon: You shall now be held accountable.
2413,"Robert Baratheon: Oh, will both of you shut your mouths? Catelyn will release Tyrion and you’ll make your peace with Jaime."
2414,Eddard Stark: He butchered my men.
2415,Cersei Baratheon: Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime.
2416,"Robert Baratheon: Quiet, woman."
2417,Eddard Stark:  Jaime has fled the city. Give me leave to bring him back to justice.
2418,Cersei Baratheon: I took you for a king.
2419,Robert Baratheon: Hold your tongue.
2420,Cersei Baratheon: He’s attacked my brother and abducted the other. I should wear the armor and you the gown.
2421,NARRATOR:Robert smacks Cersei.
2422,Cersei Baratheon: I shall wear this like a badge of honor.
2423,Robert Baratheon: Wear it in silence or I’ll honor you again.
2424,"NARRATOR:Cersei exits the room, slamming the door shut behind her."
2425,Robert Baratheon: See what she does to me? My loving wife. I should not have hit her. That was not… That was not kingly.
2426,Eddard Stark:  If we don’t act… there will be a war.
2427,"Robert Baratheon: So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to King’s Landing. She’s had her fun, now put an end to it. You hear me? Send a raven and put an end to it."
2428,Eddard Stark:  And what about Jaime Lannister? What about Jaime?
2429,"Eddard Stark:  As you command your Grace. With your leave, I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight."
2430,"Robert Baratheon: Piss on that! Send a raven. I want you to stay. I’m the king, I get what I want… I never loved my brothers. A sad thing for a man to admit, but it’s true. You were the brother I chose. We’ll talk when I return from the hunt."
2431,NARRATOR:Robert throws the Hand of the King’s badge onto the bed where Ned is laying.
2432,Eddard Stark: The hunt?
2433,Robert Baratheon: Killing things clears my head. You’ll have to sit on the throne while I’m away. You’ll hate it more than I do.
2434,Eddard Stark: The Targaryen girl -
2435,"Robert Baratheon: Seven hells! Don’t start with her again! The girl will die and I’ll hear no more of it. Put on the badge. And if you ever take it off again, I swear to the Mother I’ll pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister."
2436,"NARRATOR:Robert exits the room, slamming the door shut behind him. Ned picks up the badge and looks at it."
2437,"NARRATOR:Back at Vaes Dothrak across the sea, Daenerys is holding one of her prized dragon eggs. She looks up at a pot of coals inside of her tent. She walks over and places the egg into the coals. Irri walks into the tent."
2438,Irri: Khaleesi?
2439,NARRATOR:Daenerys picks up the egg from the coals.
2440,"Irri: Oh, Khaleesi!"
2441,"NARRATOR:Irri takes the egg from her hands, dropping it instantly because of the heat. She looks at Daenerys’ hands and there are no burn marks. The two compare hands, Irri’s have burn marks."
2442,Daenerys Targaryen: You’re hurt.
2443,"NARRATOR:A raven caws. Bran is shooting his bow in the courtyard. The raven flies to the crypts of Winterfell, Bran follows. As he enters, again making eye contact with the bird. The raven flies deeper into the crypts. We then see Bran sleeping in his bed, showing that this was another vision, we hear footsteps running towards his door. His door swings opens and Bran sits up in bed breathing heavily. Hodor is carrying the contraption that Tyrion brought the blueprints for. Bran smiles. We then cut to the woods of Winterfell where Bran is shouting as he’s riding on the back of a horse."
2444,Robb Stark: Not too fast.
2445,"Bran Stark: Come on, Dancer. (to his horse)"
2446,Theon Greyjoy: When are you gonna tell him?
2447,Robb Stark: Not now.
2448,Theon Greyjoy: Blood for blood. You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others.
2449,Robb Stark: You’re talking about war.
2450,Theon Greyjoy: I’m talking about justice.
2451,Robb Stark: Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army.
2452,Theon Greyjoy: A Lannister put his spear through your father’s leg. The Kingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch -
2453,Robb Stark:You want me to march on Casterly Rock?!
2454,Theon Greyjoy: You’re not a boy anymore. They attacked your father. They’ve already started the war. It’s your duty to represent your House when your father can’t.
2455,"Robb Stark: And it’s not your duty, because it’s not your House."
2456,"NARRATOR:It goes silent, Bran can no longer be heard jeering at his horse. Robb looks at Theon and stands up looking through the woods."
2457,Robb Stark: Where’s Bran?
2458,Theon Greyjoy: I don’t know. It’s not my House.
2459,"NARRATOR:Theon stands up and walks away from Robb, who begins to look around. We cut to Bran riding slowly through the woods. We see someone creeping up behind him as his horse is nickering. As Bran enters a clearing, several Wildlings surround him."
2460,Bran Stark: Robb?
2461,Osha: All alone in the deep dark woods.
2462,"Bran Stark: I’m not alone, my brother is with me."
2463,Wildling: I don’t see him. Got him hidden under your cloak?
2464,"Osha: Oh, that’s a pretty pin. Silver."
2465,Wildling: We’ll take the pin. And the horse. Get down… Be quick about it.
2466,"Bran Stark: I can’t. The saddle, the straps."
2467,Wildling: What’s wrong with you? You some kind of cripple?
2468,"Bran Stark: I’m Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you don’t let me be, I’ll have you all killed!"
2469,Wildling 2: Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth.
2470,Osha: the boy’s worth nothing dead. Benjen Stark’s own blood. Think what Mance would give us.
2471,"NARRATOR:A Wildling is cutting Bran’s straps to his saddle, accidentally slicing into Bran’s leg but he feels no pain."
2472,Wildling: Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North. We’re going as far south as south goes. There ain’t no white walkers down in Dorne.
2473,"NARRATOR:Robb comes into view, behind the four Wildlings."
2474,Robb Stark: Drop the knife. Let him go and I’ll let you live.
2475,"NARRATOR:One of the Wildlings storms at Robb who evades an axe attack. Robb counters, slicing the Wildling’s throat. Osha charges Robb who tosses her spins her around by her hair. He fights off and kills the other Wildling. The Wilding in charge has Bran off of his horse with a knife at his throat, meanwhile Robb has Osha (female Wildling) and a knife to her throat."
2476,Bran Stark: Robb!
2477,Wildling: Shut up! Drop the blade!
2478,"Bran Stark: No, don’t."
2479,Wildling: Do it.
2480,"NARRATOR:Robb looks at Bran and then back up at the Wildling. He then slowly sets his sword on the ground, still gripping Osha by her hair. He looks back up at the Wildling who suddenly gets an arrow through his chest from his back. As he drops to the ground bleeding, we see Theona few yards behind him with a bow. The Wildling falls dead, Theon approaches. Robb releases Osha from his grasp as Theon walks over drawing his bow on her. Robb moves over to Bran."
2481,Robb Stark: Are you all right?
2482,"Bran Stark: Yes, it doesn’t hurt."
2483,"Theon Greyjoy: Tough little lad. In the Iron Islands, you’re not a man until you’ve killed your first enemy. Well done."
2484,Robb Stark: Have you lost your mind? What if you’d missed?
2485,Theon Greyjoy: He would have killed you and cut Bran’s throat.
2486,Robb Stark: You don’t have the right -
2487,"Theon Greyjoy: To what, to save your brother’s life? It was the only thing to do, so I did it."
2488,Robb Stark: What about her?
2489,"Osha: Give me my life, my lord, and I’m yours."
2490,Robb Stark: We’ll keep her alive.
2491,"NARRATOR:Osha gives a sigh of release, Theon releases his bow and Robb, holding Bran, assures that he’s okay."
2492,"NARRATOR:Now at the Eyrie, Tyrion is sleeping and rolls to his side at the very edge of his skycell. He awakes, quickly moving back to the wall. He steps over to the door to his cell and begins pounding on it."
2493,Tyrion Lannister: Mord! Turnkey! Mord! Mord!
2494,"NARRATOR:The door swings open and Mord rushes in, batting Tyrion to the opposite side of the cell."
2495,Mord: Dwarf man making noise!
2496,Tyrion Lannister: How would you like to be rich?
2497,Mord: Dwarf man still making noise.
2498,"Tyrion Lannister: My family is rich. We have gold, lots of gold. I’m prepared to give you lots of gold."
2499,NARRATOR:Mord quickly searches Tyrion’s pockets for gold.
2500,Mord: No gold!
2501,"Tyrion Lannister: Well, I don’t have it here."
2502,Mord: No gold! Fuck off.
2503,"NARRATOR:Mord hits Tyrion once more with his club then storms out of the cell, shutting the door behind him."
2504,"NARRATOR:Now in a hall at King’s Landing. We see Syrio shutting a door and holding two wooden swords. He slowly steps down towards Arya and tosses her one of the swords, she seamlessly catches it as he takes his fighting stance."
2505,Arya Stark:  I don’t want to practice today.
2506,Syrio Forel: No?
2507,Arya Stark: They killed Jory. My father is hurt. I don’t care about stupid wooden swords.
2508,Syrio Forel: You are troubled.
2509,Arya Stark:  Yes -
2510,"Syrio Forel: Good! Trouble is the perfect time for training. When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens, this is not when fighting happens."
2511,Arya Stark: I don’t like dolls and k -
2512,Syrio Forel: You’re not here. You’re with your trouble. If you’re with your trouble when fighting happens…
2513,"NARRATOR:Arya makes a move for Syrio, who quickly counters and puts her on her back."
2514,"Syrio Forel: … More trouble for you. Just so… How can you be quick as a snake, or as quiet as a shadow, when you are somewhere else? You are fearing for your father, hmm? That is right. Do you pray to the gods?"
2515,Syrio Forel: The old and the new.
2516,"NARRATOR:Syrio steps back and tosses Arya her sword back, she catches it and assumes the counter position."
2517,"NARRATOR:Back across the sea in Vaes Dothrak, we’re inside a large communal tent. Daenerys is centered around everyone and eating the heart of a horse a the Dothraki and a priest chant around her. Her husband Khal Drogo looks on in anticipation as she continues eating."
2518,Viserys Targaryen: She has to eat a whole heart? I hope that wasn’t my horse.
2519,Jorah Mormont: She’s doing well.
2520,Viserys Targaryen: She’ll never keep it down.
2521,"NARRATOR:She keeps eating the heart, nearing the end. The Dothraki onlookers all chant in unison, getting louder and louder. The priestess is also chanting, louder and louder. Khal Drogo stares more intently at his wife, she stares back. The chanting grows louder, as does the priestess."
2522,Viserys Targaryen: Tell me what she is saying.
2523,Jorah Mormont: “The prince is riding. I have heard the thunder of the hooves. Swift as the wind he rides. His enemies will cower before him… and their wives will weep tears of blood.”
2524,NARRATOR:The eating and chantines intensifies as Viserys looks on in shock.
2525,Jorah Mormont: She’s going to have a boy.
2526,Viserys Targaryen: He won’t be a real Targaryen. He won’t be a true dragon.
2527,"NARRATOR:As the chanting is at it’s loudest, Daenerys has finished with the heart. Everyone looks on in anticipations, she wretches forward, on the verge of puking. The chanting suddenly halts. Khal Drogo leans in and looks intensly. Daenerys holds everything in and sobs. Her hands bloody, she slowly sits up, keeping everything in as she gulps the final bite. The priestess begins to speak, Jorah translates directly for Viserys."
2528,"Jora: “The stallion who mounts the world.” The stallion, is the khal of khals. He shall unite the people into a single khalasar. All the people of the world will be his herd."
2529,"NARRATOR:Daenerys rises to her feet, speaking in Dothraki to the room."
2530,Daenerys Targaryen: A prince rides inside me! And he shall be called Rhaego!
2531,"NARRATOR:The room begins chanting, “Rhaego! Rhaego!” As the chanting grows louder and louder, Drogo stands up and walks up to Daenerys."
2532,Viserys Targaryen: They love her.
2533,"NARRATOR:The room’s chanting gets even louder. Drogo hugs his wife at her thighs and hoists her up, carrying her around the room."
2534,Jorah Mormont: She truly is a queen today.
2535,"NARRATOR:Jorah looks to his right towards Viserys, who has now slipped out. We cut to Daenerys’ tent. Inside, Viserys opens the container that holds her dragon eggs. He sighs and then puts them into a sack. Jorah walks into the tent behind him, blocking the door."
2536,Jorah Mormont: Don’t let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak. You know the law.
2537,Viserys Targaryen: It’s not my law.
2538,Jorah Mormont: They don’t belong to you.
2539,Viserys Targaryen: Whatever is hers is also mine.
2540,"Jorah Mormont: Once, perhaps."
2541,Jorah Mormont: And you have all three.
2542,"Viserys Targaryen: I need a large army… I’m the last hope of a dynasty, Mormont. The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen, on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent. Never. Not a piece of it… How can I carry what I need to carry without it? Hmm? Who can rule without wealth, or fear, or love? Oh, you stand there, all nobility and honor. You don’t think I see you looking at my little sister, hmm? Don’t think I know what you want? I don’t care. You can have her. She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts, and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like. But let me go."
2543,"Jorah Mormont: You can go, but you can’t have the eggs."
2544,Viserys Targaryen: You swore an oath to me. Does loyalty mean nothing to you?
2545,Jorah Mormont: It means everything to me.
2546,Viserys Targaryen: And yet here you stand?
2547,Jorah Mormont: And here I stand.
2548,"NARRATOR:Viserys and Jorah stare at each other for a moment, before Viserys drops the sack containing the dragon eggs to the floor. Jorah steps aside, unblocking the exit. Viserys leaves."
2549,NARRATOR:Back at the skycell below the Eyrie. Tyrion is again shouting for Mord.
2550,Tyrion Lannister: Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord! Mord!
2551,Mord: Noise again!
2552,Tyrion Lannister: About the gold -
2553,Mord: No gold!
2554,"Tyrion Lannister: Listen to me! Listen to me! Sometimes possession… is an abstract concept. When they captured me they took my purse, but the gold is still mine."
2555,Mord: Where?
2556,"Tyrion Lannister: Where? I don’t know where, but when they free me -"
2557,Mord: You want free? Go be free. (points out of the skycell)
2558,"Tyrion Lannister: Have you ever heard the phrase “Rich as a Lannister”? Of course you have. You’re a smart man. You know who the Lannisters are. I am a Lannister. Tyrion, son of Tywin! And of course, you have also heard the phrase, “a Lannister always pays his debts.” If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn, I will be in your debt. I will owe you gold. If you deliver the message and I live, which I very much intend to do."
2559,Mord: What message?
2560,Tyrion Lannister: Tell her I wish to confess my crimes.
2561,"NARRATOR:We cut to the throne room, where Lady Arryn and her son Robin are sitting on the throne, at the helm of the room. Catelyn is standing next to them, as Robin is tapping a knife against the throne itself very annoyingly."
2562,Lysa Arryn: You wish to confess your crimes?
2563,"Tyrion Lannister: Yes, my lady. I do, my lady."
2564,"Lysa Arryn: Skycells always break them. Speak, Imp. Meet your gods as an honest man."
2565,"Tyrion Lannister: Where do I begin, my lords and ladies? I’m a vile man, I confess it. My crimes and sins are beyond counting. I have lied and cheated, gambled and whored. I’m not particularly good at violence, but I’m good at convincing others to do violence for me. You want specifics, I suppose. When I was seven, I saw a servant girl bathing in the river. I stole her robe. She was forced to return to the castle, naked and in tears. I close my eyes, I can still see her tits bouncing. When I was ten, I stuffed my uncle’s boots with goatshit. When confronted with my crime, I blamed a squire. Poor boy was flogged and… I escaped justice. When I was twelve, I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew. I flogged the one-eyed snake. I skinned my sausage. I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew, which I do believe my sister ate. At least I hope she did. I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel -"
2566,Lysa Arryn: Silence!
2567,Robin Arryn:What happened next?!
2568,Lysa Arryn: What do you think you’re doing?
2569,Tyrion Lannister: Confessing my crimes.
2570,"Catelyn Stark: Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister’s husband; Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King."
2571,"Tyrion Lannister: Oh, I’m very sorry. I don’t know anything about all that."
2572,"Lysa Arryn: You’ve had your little joke. I trust you enjoyed it. Mord, take him back to the dungeon. But this time find a smaller cell, with a steeper floor."
2573,"Tyrion Lannister: Is this how justice is done in the Vale? you accuse me of crimes, I deny them, so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve? Where is the King’s Justice? I’m accused and demand a trial."
2574,"Lysa Arryn: If you’re tried and found guilty, then by the king’s own laws you will pay with your life."
2575,Tyrion Lannister: I understand the law.
2576,Lysa Arryn: We have no executioner in the Eyrie. Life is more elegant here. Open the Moon Door.
2577,"NARRATOR:Several men begin unwinding a giant crank on one side of the room. In between Tyrion and the raised throne is what looks like a well. The well’s floor begins to open and wind comes howling through. Robin begins giggling and rapidly clapping his hands. Tyrion looks down and sees that it’s a great distance through this Moon Door to the ground, he would inevitably die if he had to go out this “door”."
2578,"Lysa Arryn: You want a trial, my Lord Lannister. Very well. My son will listen to whatever you have to say, and you will hear his judgement. Then you will leave, by one door or the other."
2579,Tyrion Lannister: No need to bother Lord Robin. I demand a trial by combat.
2580,"NARRATOR:Subdued laughter fills the room, Catelyn and Lysa exchange looks."
2581,Lysa Arryn: You have that right.
2582,"Knight 1: My lady, I beg the honor. Let me be your champion."
2583,Knight 2: The honor should be mine. For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death.
2584,"Knight 3: I’ll fight for you, my Lady."
2585,Knight 4: It’ll be my honor.
2586,Knight 5: The honor should be mine.
2587,Robin Arryn: Make the bad man fly!
2588,Lysa Arryn: Ser Vardis… You’re quiet. Did you want to avenge my husband?
2589,"Ser Vardis: With all my heart, my Lady. But the Imp is half my size. It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice."
2590,Tyrion Lannister: Agreed.
2591,Lysa Arryn: You demanded a trial by combat.
2592,"Tyrion Lannister: Now I demand a champion. I have that right, same as you."
2593,"Ser Vardis: My Lady, I would gladly fight the Imp’s champion for you."
2594,"Tyrion Lannister: I wouldn’t be too glad, ser. I name my brother, Jaime Lannister."
2595,NARRATOR:The room shudders.
2596,Lysa Arryn: The Kingslayer is hundreds of miles from here.
2597,"Tyrion Lannister: Send a raven for him, I’m happy to wait."
2598,Lysa Arryn: The trial will be today.
2599,Tyrion Lannister: Do I have a volunteer?
2600,"NARRATOR:Again, the majority of the room laughs quietly."
2601,Tyrion Lannister: Anyone?... Anyone?
2602,Lysa Arryn: I think that we can assume that no one is willing -
2603,Bronn: I’ll stand for the dwarf.
2604,"NARRATOR:In the woods, outside of King’s Landing."
2605,"Lancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?"
2606,"Robert Baratheon: Oh, what was I saying?"
2607,Renly Baratheon: A simpler time.
2608,"Robert Baratheon: It was! It was. You’re too young to remember. Wasn’t it, Selmy?"
2609,"Barriston: It was, your Grace."
2610,"Robert Baratheon: The enemy was right there in the open, vicious as you like, all but sending you a bloody invitation. Nothing like today."
2611,Renly Baratheon: Sounds exhilarating.
2612,"Robert Baratheon: Exhilarating, yes. Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw. (laughs) You ever fucked a Riverlands girl?"
2613,"Renly Baratheon: Once, I think."
2614,"Robert Baratheon: You think? I think you’d remember. Back in our day, you weren’t a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands. We called it “making the eight.”"
2615,Renly Baratheon: Those were some lucky girls.
2616,"Robert Baratheon: You ever make the eight, Barristan?"
2617,"Barristan Selmy: I don’t believe so, your Grace."
2618,Robert Baratheon: (laughs) Those were the days!
2619,"Renly Baratheon: What days were those? The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died? Or before that, when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it? Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground?"
2620,"Robert Baratheon: Easy, boy. You might be my brother, but you’re speaking to the King."
2621,Renly Baratheon: I suppose it was all rather heroic. If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and “make the eight.”
2622,"Lancel Lannister: More wine, your Grace?"
2623,NARRATOR:Renly walks off in the opposite direction of the group. Robert takes a large swig off of the wine and quickly continue walking.
2624,"NARRATOR:In the throne room of King’s Landing. Ned sits upon the throne as a fill in for Robert, as he is Hand of the King. Baelish is at his right and Grand Maester Pycelle to his left. The room is filled with people."
2625,"Man: They burned most everything in the Riverlands, our fields, our granaries, our homes. They took our women and then they took ‘em again. When they was done, they butchered them as if they was animals. They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire."
2626,"Grand Maester Pycelle: Brigands, most likely."
2627,"Man: They weren’t thieves, they didn’t steal nothing. They even left something behind, your Grace."
2628,"Grand Maester Pycelle: It’s the King’s Hand you’re addressing, not the king. The king is hunting."
2629,NARRATOR:A second man walks forward and empties a sack out onto the floor. It’s a pile of fish.
2630,"Eddard Stark:  These men, were they flying a sigil? … A banner."
2631,"Man: None, your… Hand. The one who was leading them… Taller by a foot than any man I’ve ever met, saw him cut the blacksmith, saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword."
2632,Petyr Baelish: (whisper) That sounds like someone we know. The Mountain.
2633,Eddard Stark:  You’re describing Ser Gregor Clegane.
2634,Grand Maester Pycelle: Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand? The man is an anointed knight.
2635,Petyr Baelish: I’ve heard him called “Tywin Lannister’s mad dog.” I’m sure you have as well. (whispering to Ned) Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife?
2636,"Grand Maester Pycelle: If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the king’s protection, it would be -"
2637,Petyr Baelish: It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital.
2638,Grand Maester Pycelle: Wel…
2639,"Eddard Stark:  I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life. But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king, Robert. Lord Beric Dondarrion."
2640,NARRATOR:Beric Dondarrion steps from the back of the room forward.
2641,Eddard Stark:  You shall have the command. Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregor’s keep.
2642,Beric Dondarrion: As you command.
2643,NARRATOR:Ned stands up with the assistance of a cane. He steps forward.
2644,"Eddard Stark:  In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon, the First of his Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm, I charge you to bring the king’s justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes. I denounce him and attaint him. I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings, and sentence him to death."
2645,Grand Maester Pycelle: My lord… This… This is a drastic action. It would be better to wait for King Robert’s return.
2646,Eddard Stark:  Grand Maester Pycelle.
2647,Grand Maester Pycelle: My Lord.
2648,"Eddard Stark:  Send a raven to Casterly Rock. Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen. He will arrive within the fortnight, or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm."
2649,"NARRATOR:The men all bow their heads in acknowledgement. Ned steps down from the throne, Baelish follows him, speaking only to Ned."
2650,"Petyr Baelish: A bold move, my Lord, and admirable. But is it wise to yank the lion’s tail? Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms. Gold wins wars, not soldiers."
2651,Eddard Stark: Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister?
2652,Robin Arryn: Is it over?
2653,Lysa Arryn: You don’t fight with honor!
2654,Bronn: No. He did.
2655,NARRATOR:Tyrion turns to Mord who uncuffs him.
2656,Robin Arryn: Can I make the little man fly now?
2657,Tyrion Lannister: Not this little man. This little man is going home. I believe you have something of mine.
2658,"NARRATOR:Rodrik Cassel tosses Tyrion his purse. Tyrion bows before Catelyn, begins walking out, Bronn following. He tosses Mord the purse full of coins."
2659,Tyrion Lannister: A Lannister always pays his debts.
2660,"NARRATOR:At King’s Landing, Sansa Stark and Septa Mordane, both sowing."
2661,Mordane: You wear your hair like a real southern lady now.
2662,"Sansa Stark: Well, why shouldn’t I? We’re in the south."
2663,Mordane: It’s important to remember where you come from. I’m not sure your mother would like these new styles.
2664,Sansa Stark: My mother isn’t from the North.
2665,Mordane: I’m aware of that.
2666,Sansa Stark: Why do you care? Do you even have hair under there?
2667,Mordane: Yes. I have hair.
2668,Sansa Stark: I’ve never seen it.
2669,Mordane: Would you like to?
2670,"Sansa Stark: No. Where are you from anyway, the north or the south?"
2671,Mordane: I come from a very small village in -
2672,"Sansa Stark: Oh, wait. I just realized… I don’t care."
2673,Mordane: Sansa -
2674,Sansa Stark: Septa.
2675,Mordane: Now you are being rude.
2676,NARRATOR:A door can be heard closing. Prince Joffrey walks in. Sansa’s eyes light up as both women stand up.
2677,Mordane: My prince.
2678,Sansa Stark: My prince.
2679,Joffrey Baratheon:  My lady. I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks. With your permission?
2680,"NARRATOR:Joffrey offers Sansa a necklace. She turns around, for him to put it on her, as acceptance."
2681,Sansa Stark: It’s beautiful. Like the one your mother wears.
2682,"Joffrey Baratheon:  You’ll be queen one day, it’s only fitting that you should look the part. Will you forgive me for my rudeness?"
2683,Sansa Stark: There’s nothing to forgive.
2684,"Joffrey Baratheon: You’re my lady. One day we’ll be married in the throne room. Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come, from the last hearth in the North, to the salt shore of the south. And you will be queen over all of them.  I’ll never disrespect you again. I’ll never be cruel to you again. Do you understand me? You’re my lady now, from this day, until my last day."
2685,NARRATOR:The two share their first kiss.
2686,"NARRATOR:In the woods outside of Winterfell, Theon is riding his horse, alone. He comes to a road and sees a carriage leaving, Ros on the back of it riding south."
2687,Theon Greyjoy: Stop! Stop! What are you doing?!
2688,Ros: Going to King’s Landing.
2689,Theon Greyjoy: In a turnip cart?
2690,Ros: I’ll find a ship heading south in White Harbor.
2691,Theon Greyjoy: And you can afford that?
2692,Ros: Some of my friends are more generous than others.

3085,NARRATOR:The wine merchant obeys and opens the cask.
3086,Jorah Mormont:  Pour.

4035,NARRATOR:You all know he loved him.
4036,NARRATOR:He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him.

4054,Eddard Stark:  Another visit? lt seems you're my last friend.
4055,"Varys:  No, no, many still love you. Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life."
4056,Eddard Stark:  On her knees begging for me. Hm! Did you laugh with the others?
4057,"Varys:  You do me wrong, my lord. Your blood is the last thing l want."
4058,Eddard Stark:  l don't know what you want. l've given up trying to guess.
4059,Eddard Stark:  Huh. Can you free me from this pit?
4060,"Varys:  l could. But will l? No. As l said, I'm no hero."
4061,"Eddard Stark:  What do you want? Tell me. No riddles, no stories. Tell me, what do you want?"
4062,Varys:  Peace. Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen? Loyal lad. Fighting for his father's freedom.
4063,Eddard Stark:  Robb? He's just a boy.
4064,Varys:  Boys have been conquerors before. But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the king's the late king's brother. Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne. He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy.
4065,Eddard Stark:  Stannis Baratheon is Robert's true heir. The throne is his by rights.
4066,Varys:  Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life. lt would be a shame to throw it away. Cersei is no fool. She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one.
4067,"Eddard Stark:  You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king, who butchered my men, who crippled my son?"
4068,"Varys:  l want you to serve the realm! Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason, tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir. Cersei knows you as a man of honor. lf you give her the peace she needs, and promise to carry her secret to your grave, l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son."
4069,Eddard Stark:  You think my life is some precious thing to me? That l would trade my honor for a few more years of... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But l grew up with soldiers. l learned how to die a long time ago.

4072,Robb Stark:  lt's a birthday message to his grand-niece Walda.
4073,Theon Greyjoy:  Or so Walder Frey would have you think.
4074,Catelyn Stark:  Keep shooting them down. We can't risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters.
4075,Robb Stark:  He's Grandfather's bannerman. We can't expect his support?
4076,Greatjon Umber:  Expect nothing of Walder Frey and you'll never be surprised. Look.
4077,Robb Stark:  Father rots in a dungeon. How long before they take his head? We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now.
4078,Theon Greyjoy:  Just march up to his gates and tell him you're crossing. We've got five times his numbers. You can take the Twins if you have to.
4079,Greatjon Umber:  Not in time. Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak.
4080,"Catelyn Stark:  The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years, and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll."
4081,Robb Stark:  Have my horse saddled and ready.
4082,Greatjon Umber:  Enter the Twins alone and he'll sell you to the Lannisters as he likes.
4083,Theon Greyjoy:  Or throw you in a dungeon. Or slit your throat.
4084,"Robb Stark:  My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing. Whatever it took. lf l'm going to lead this army, l can't have other men doing my bargaining for me."
4085,Catelyn Stark:  l agree. l'll go.
4086,Everyone:  You can't!
4087,Catelyn Stark:  l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl. He would never harm me.
4088,Greatjon Umber:  Unless there was a profit in it.
4089,"NARRATOR:Catelyn finds herself inside the Twins, which the Freys gathered to watch her audience with Lord Walder."
4090,Walder Frey:  What do you want?
4091,"Catelyn Stark:  lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years, my lord."
4092,"Walder Frey:  Oh, spare me. Your boy's too proud to come before me himself. What am l supposed to do with you?"
4093,"Stevron Frey:  Father, you forget yourself. Lady Stark is –"
4094,"Walder Frey:  Who asked you? You're not Lord Frey yet, not until l die. Do l look dead to you?"
4095,"Ryger Rivers:  Father, please –"
4096,"Walder Frey:  l need lessons in courtesy from you, bastard? Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadn't squirted you into her belly."
4097,"NARRATOR:(gestures to Catelyn) All right, you come forward."
4098,"NARRATOR:(kisses her hand) There. Now that l've observed the courtesies, perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths."
4099,Catelyn Stark:  ls there somewhere we can talk?
4100,Walder Frey:  We're talking right now. Fine. Out! All of you!
4101,NARRATOR:(taps his new wife on the bottom) Oh! You too.
4102,"NARRATOR:(To Catelyn) You see that? Fifteen, she is. A little flower. And her honey's all mine."
4103,Catelyn Stark:  l'm sure she will give you many sons.
4104,Walder Frey:  Huh. Your father didn't come to the wedding.
4105,"Catelyn Stark:  He is quite ill, my lord."
4106,"Walder Frey:  Huh. Didn't come to the last one, either. Or the one before that. Your family has always pissed on me."
4107,"Catelyn Stark:  My lord, l –"
4108,Walder Frey:  Don't deny it. You know it's true. The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine.
4109,Catelyn Stark:  l'm sure there were reasons –
4110,Walder Frey:  l didn't need reasons. l needed to get rid of sons and daughters. You see how they pile up? Why are you here?
4111,"Catelyn Stark:  To ask you to open your gates, my lord, so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way."
4112,Walder Frey:  Why should l let him?
4113,"Catelyn Stark:  lf you could climb your own battlements, you would see that he has 20,000 men outside your walls."
4114,"Walder Frey:  There will be 20,000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here. Don't try and frighten me, Lady Stark. Your husband's in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your son's got no fur to keep his balls warm."
4115,Catelyn Stark:  You swore an oath to my father.
4116,"Walder Frey:  Oh, yes, l said some words. And l swore oaths to the crown too, if l remember right. Joffrey's king now, which makes your boy and his corpses-to-be nothing but rebels, it seems to me. lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish, l'd hand you both over to the Lannisters."
4117,Catelyn Stark:  Why don't you?
4118,"Walder Frey:  Stark, Tully, Lannister, Baratheon. Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you?"
4119,NARRATOR:--------------------------------
4120,"NARRATOR:At Castle Black, Jon Snow and Commander Mormont are having a chat."
4121,Voices outside:  And engage!
4122,Jeor Mormont:  When does Aemon think you'll be able to use that hand?
4123,"Jon Snow:  Soon, he says."
4124,"Jeor Mormont:  Good. You'll be ready for this, then. l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made. lt's called Longclaw. Works as well for a wolf as a bear, l think."
4125,Jon Snow:  This is Valyrian steel.
4126,"Jeor Mormont:  lt was my father's sword, his father before him. The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries. lt was meant for my son Jorah. He brought dishonor to our House, but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros."
4127,"Jon Snow:  My lord, you honor me, but l can't –"
4128,"Jeor Mormont:  Oh, you can. And you will. l wouldn't be standing here if it wasn't for you and your beast. A bloody dead man tried to kill me, so you'll take it. l'll hear no more about it. ls that understood?"
4129,"Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord."
4130,"Jeor Mormont:  Right. Now, don't think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne. That's a man's sword. lt'll take a man to wield it."
4131,Jon Snow:  l'll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight.
4132,"Jeor Mormont:  No, you won't. l sent him to King's Landing yesterday. The hand that your wolf tore off that thing's wrist – l've ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king. That should get young Joffrey's attention. And it, uh, puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne. Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper."
4133,"Jon Snow:  Yes, my lord."
4134,"NARRATOR:Jon Snow leaves the room and emerges outside, heading towards the mess hall."
4135,Unidentified Night’s Watchers:  Well done. Well done.

4138,"NARRATOR:Jon arrives at the mess hall. The other men gather around him to see his new sword, but Sam remains seated at a distance, looking distraught."
4139,"Pyp:  Go on, let's have a look."
4140,Jon Snow:  At what?
4141,Grenn:  The sword! Show us the sword.
4142,All:  Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword! Sword!
4143,Pyp:  Let's have a look.
4144,Grenn:  Piss off.
4145,"Pyp:  Come on, l want to have a look at it in the light. Give it here!"
4146,Grenn:  Look at its eyes.
4147,"NARRATOR:While the others are playing with the sword, Jon gets seated beside Sam."
4148,Jon Snow:  What is it?
4149,Jon Snow:  You can't what?
4150,Samwell Tarly:  l'm really not supposed to say.
4151,Jon Snow:  And yet you really want to say. You want to say that…
4152,Samwell Tarly:  There was a raven. l read the message to Maester Aemon. lt's your brother Robb.
4153,Jon Snow:  What? What about him?
4154,"Samwell Tarly:  He's heading south. To war. All his bannermen have rallied to his side, they'll keep him safe."
4155,Jon Snow:  l should be there. l should be with him.
4156,NARRATOR:--------------------------
4157,"NARRATOR:Back at the Crossing, Catelyn returns from her conversation with Walder Frey at the Twins, and finds Robb and the others having a meeting in his tent."
4158,"Greatjon Umber:  lf we do that, they'll never get back across."
4159,Robb Stark:  Well? What did he say?
4160,"Catelyn Stark:  Lord Walder has granted your crossing. His men are yours, as well."
4161,Robb Stark:  Huh.
4162,Catelyn Stark:  Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you.
4163,Robb Stark:  What does he want in return?
4164,Catelyn Stark:  You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire. He expects a knighthood in good time.
4165,"Robb Stark:   Fine, fine. And?"
4166,Catelyn Stark:  And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age.
4167,Robb Stark:  She won't be happy about that. And?
4168,Catelyn Stark:  And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters. Whichever you prefer. He has a number he thinks will be suitable.
4169,Robb Stark:  l see. Did you get a look at his daughters?
4170,Catelyn Stark:  l did.
4171,Robb Stark:  And?
4172,Catelyn Stark:  One was – Do you consent?
4173,Robb Stark:  Can l refuse?
4174,Catelyn Stark:  Not if you want to cross.
4175,Robb Stark:  Then l consent.
4176,NARRATOR:Robb leaves the meeting right away. Theon laughs while Catelyn watches.

4178,NARRATOR:--------------
4179,"NARRATOR:Back at Castle Black. Jon goes to see Maester Aemon, finding him cutting meat to serve to the ravens."
4180,Jon Snow:  Sam said you wanted to see me?
4181,"Maester Aemon:  l did indeed. Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me. Tell me, did you ever wonder why the men of the Night's Watch take no wives and father no children?"
4182,Jon Snow:  No.
4183,"Maester Aemon:  So they will not love. Love is the death of duty. lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other, what would he do?"
4184,"Jon Snow:  He would do whatever was right, no matter what."
4185,"Maester Aemon:  Then Lord Stark is one man in 10,000. Most of us are not so strong. What is honor compared to a woman's love? And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms? Or a brother's smile?"
4186,Jon Snow:  Sam told you.
4187,"Maester Aemon:  We're all human. Oh, we all do our duty when there's no cost to it. Honor comes easy then. Yet sooner or later in every man's life there comes a day when it is not easy. A day when he must choose."
4188,Jon Snow:  And this is my day? ls that what you're saying?
4189,"Maester Aemon:  Oh, it hurts, boy. Oh, yes. l know."
4190,"Jon Snow:  You do not know. No one knows. l may be a bastard, but he is my father and Robb is my brother."
4191,"Maester Aemon:  The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows. They waited till l was old. What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South: the ruin of my House, the death of my family? l was helpless, blind, frail. But when l heard they had killed my brother's son and his poor son and the children! Even the little children."
4192,Jon Snow:  Who are you?
4193,"Maester Aemon:  My father was Maekar, the first of his name. My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne. And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King."
4194,Jon Snow:  You're Aemon Targaryen.
4195,"Maester Aemon:  l'm a maester of the Citadel, bound in service to Castle Black and the Night's Watch. l will not tell you to stay or go. You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days. As l have."

4197,"NARRATOR:Across the Narrow Sea, the Dothraki are on the move. Drogo leads them, but seems to have fainted. Daenerys rides right behind him."
4198,Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) My lord… My sun and stars… Drogo.
4199,NARRATOR:Drogo falls off his horse.
4200,Khal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) My horse…
4201,Cohollo:  (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood…
4202,"Khal Drogo:  (in Dothraki) No, l must ride."
4203,Qotho:  (in Dothraki) He fell from his horse. A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal.
4204,"Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) He's tired, that's all. He needs to rest. We've ridden far enough today. We'll camp here."
4205,Qotho:  (in Dothraki) This is no place to camp. A woman does not give us orders. Not even a Khaleesi.
4206,Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) We'll camp here. Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it.
4207,"Qotho:  (in Dothraki) You do not command me, Khaleesi."
4208,Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Find Mirri Maz Duur. Bring her to me.
4209,"Qotho:  (in Dothraki) The witch? l'll bring you her head, Khaleesi."
4210,Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me.
4211,Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Hyah! Hyah!
4212,NARRATOR:---------------------
4213,"NARRATOR:At the Lannister camp, Tywin is presiding over lunch/war meeting. Tyrion gets there while everyone’s already seated and eating."

4215,"Tywin Lannister:  The boy may lack experience and sense, but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage."
4216,"Tyrion Lannister:  Oh, do continue. Didn't mean to interrupt."
4217,"Tywin Lannister:  l do hope your savages are going to be of some use, otherwise we've wasted good steel on them."
4218,"Kevan Lannister:  The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes. Heavy black steel, double-sided."
4219,Tyrion Lannister:  Shagga likes axes.
4220,"Tywin Lannister:  When the battle commences, you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard."
4221,Tyrion Lannister:  The vanguard? Me and the tribesmen on the front lines?
4222,Kevan Lannister:  They do seem rather ferocious.
4223,"Tyrion Lannister:  Ferocious? Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage. Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat. Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead man's cock, which was fortunate, but even still, Ulf is demanding blood money, which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay."
4224,"Tywin Lannister:  When soldiers lack discipline, the fault lies with their commander."
4225,Tyrion Lannister:  Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort.
4226,Tywin Lannister:  There'll be no more discussion on the matter.
4227,"Tyrion Lannister:  lt appears l'm not hungry after all. Excuse me, my lords."
4228,"NARRATOR:Back at his tent, Tyrion finds Bronn there with a woman (a prostitute) waiting there too."
4229,Tyrion Lannister:  Where did you find one so pretty at this hour?

4231,Tyrion Lannister:  Took her? From whom?
4232,"Bronn:  From, uh, Ser What's-his-name? l don't know. Ginger cunt, three tents down."
4233,Tyrion Lannister:  And he didn't have anything to say about it?
4234,Bronn:  He said something.
4235,"Tyrion Lannister:  Well, the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically. We'll be at the vanguard tomorrow."
4236,"Bronn:  Oh, well. l, uh, think l'll go and find myself one."
4237,NARRATOR:Bronn leaves. Tyrion addresses the prostitute.
4238,Tyrion Lannister:  Who are you?
4239,Prostitute:  Who would you like me to be?
4240,Tyrion Lannister:  What did your mother call you?
4241,Prostitute:  Shae. What did your mother call you?
4242,Tyrion Lannister:  My mother died giving birth to me.
4243,Shae:  ls that why l'm here? So we can talk about our mothers?
4244,Tyrion Lannister:  What sort of accent is that?
4245,Shae:  Foreign.
4246,Tyrion Lannister:  For-
4247,Shae:  What do you want from me?
4248,"Tyrion Lannister:  What do l want from you? l want you to share my tent. l want you to pour my wine, laugh at my jokes, rub my legs when they're sore after a day's ride. l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as we're together. And l want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world. Which it may well be."
4249,Shae:  And what do l get?

4264,"Jorah Mormont:  This isn't Westeros, where men honor blood. Here they only honor strength. There will be fighting after Drogo dies. Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal. He won't want any rivals. Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs."
4265,Daenerys Targaryen:  l won't leave him.

4270,"Qotho:  (in Dothraki) No? No? You don't want her hurt? Pray we don't hurt you, too. You let this witch put her hands on our Khal."
4271,Jorah Mormont:  (in Dothraki) Rein in your tongue. She is still your Khaleesi.
4272,"Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Only while the blood of my blood lives. When he dies, she is nothing."
4273,Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) l have never been nothing. l am the blood of the dragon.

4280,Daenerys Targaryen:  And now you must save him.
4281,Mirri Maz Duur:  He's beyond the healer's skills. All l can do is ease his path.
4282,Daenerys Targaryen:  Save him and l will free you. l swear it. You must know a way. Some – some magic.
4283,Mirri Maz Duur:  There is a spell. Some would say death is cleaner.
4284,Daenerys Targaryen:  Do it. Save him.
4285,Mirri Maz Duur:  There is a price.
4286,"Daenerys Targaryen:   You'll have gold, whatever you want."
4287,Mirri Maz Duur:  lt's not a matter of gold. This is blood magic. Only death pays for life.
4288,Daenerys Targaryen:  My death?
4289,"Mirri Maz Duur:  No, not your death, Khaleesi. Bring me his horse."
4290,"NARRATOR:Daenerys signals to Irri, who leaves to find the horse. We cut to the horse being taken by a rope into to the tent."

4304,NARRATOR:What have you done?
4305,Daenerys Targaryen:  l have to save him.
4306,"NARRATOR:We could have been 10 miles away from here by now, on the way to Asshai. You would have been safe."
4307,Qotho:  (in Dothraki) This must not be.
4308,Daenerys Targaryen:  (in Dothraki) This must be.
4309,Qotho:  (in Dothraki) Witch.

4327,"Shae:  Are you in agony, my lion?"
4328,Tyrion Lannister:  No.
4329,Shae:  You look like you're in agony. The fire is burning your pretty soft skin.
4330,"Tyrion Lannister:  Ah! Damn you, woman. Are you immune to pain?"
4331,Shae:  Just used to it.
4332,Bronn:   Drink.
4333,Tyrion Lannister:  Let's play a new game.
4334,Bronn:  There's a Braavosi knife game l could teach you.
4335,Tyrion Lannister:  Does it involve the potential for losing fingers?
4336,Bronn:  Not if you win.
4337,"Tyrion Lannister:  No! No fire games, no knife games. Let's do something l'm good at."
4338,Shae:  What are you good at?
4339,Tyrion Lannister:  l happen to be a great judge of character.
4340,Bronn:  This sounds like a boring game.
4341,Shae:  l don't want to play this game.
4342,Tyrion Lannister:  Fine. Bronn first. Your father beat you.
4343,NARRATOR:Bronn drinks.
4344,Bronn:  But my mother hit harder.
4345,Tyrion Lannister:  You killed your first man before you were 12.
4346,"Bronn:  lt was a woman. (Tyrion drinks. Shae looks at Bronn, surprised.) She swung an axe at me."
4347,Tyrion Lannister:  You've been north of the Wall.
4348,Shae:  What brought you up there?
4349,Bronn:  Work.
4350,"Tyrion Lannister:  And you once loved a woman many years ago, but it turned out badly so you've never let yourself love again. Oh, wait, that's me. (Tyrion drinks) Your turn, my mysterious foreign beauty."
4351,Shae:  l don't want to play.
4352,Tyrion Lannister:  lt's fun! Look at the fun we're having. Your mother was a whore.
4353,Shae:  Drink.
4354,NARRATOR:Tyrion drinks.
4355,"Tyrion Lannister:  All right. Your father left the family when you were very young, never to return."
4356,Shae:  Drink.
4357,Tyrion Lannister:  And we've established the rules about lying?
4358,Shae:  Drink!
4359,NARRATOR:Tyrion drinks.
4360,Tyrion Lannister:  You wanted a different life. You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere.
4361,Bronn:  The whole shit-stained world could drink off that one.
4362,"Tyrion Lannister:  So, specifics… You wanted to be elsewhere, but how would you get there? l don't believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you. So, what's a lowborn girl to do?"
4363,Shae:  Drink.
4364,Tyrion Lannister:  Are you sure –
4365,"Shae:  Drink! And don't talk about my mother and father ever, or l will carve your eyes from your head."
4366,"Tyrion Lannister:  My dear lady, if l have offended you, l apologize."
4367,Shae:  My turn.
4368,"Tyrion Lannister:  Fine, fine. Ask away. Try to penetrate the enigma that is me."
4369,Shae:  Who were you in love with?
4370,Tyrion Lannister:  That's not how the game works.
4371,Shae:  l don't care the way the game works.
4372,Bronn:  Our lord here used to be married.
4373,Shae:  Married?
4374,Tyrion Lannister:  How did you hear that?
4375,Bronn:  You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers.
4376,"Tyrion Lannister:  Another night, perhaps."
4377,Shae:  Not another night. This night.
4378,Tyrion Lannister:  lt's not a pleasant story.
4379,"Shae:  Oh, maybe l will cry."
4380,Bronn:  l'm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship.
4381,"Tyrion Lannister:  So l was 16. My brother Jaime and l were riding, when we heard a scream. She ran out onto the road, clothes half torn off, with two men on her heels. Jaime scared away the men easily enough, while l wrapped her in my cloak. She was too scared to send off on her own, so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her. Her name was Tysha. She was a wheelwright's orphan. And she was hungry. Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine. lmpossible as it seems, there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine. l forgot how afraid l was around girls. how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed, or ask me about my tall, handsome brother. l forgot about everything but Tysha. And somehow l found myself in her bed."
4382,"Bronn:  For three chickens, l should hope so."
4383,"Bronn:  Well, l imagine that was the end of all that."
4384,Bronn:  l would have killed the man who did that to me.
4385,Shae:  You should have known she was a whore.
4386,"Tyrion Lannister:  Really? l was 16, drunk and in love."
4387,Shae:  A girl who was almost raped doesn't invite another man into her bed two hours later.
4388,"Tyrion Lannister:  As l said, l was young and stupid."
4389,Shae:  You are still young and stupid.
4390,"NARRATOR:Shae starts kissing Tyrion, causing Bronn to leave the tent. The next day, the Lannisters ride to battle; Bronn returns to Tyrion’s tent to wake him and Shae up."
4391,Tyrion Lannister:  What is it? What do you want?
4392,Bronn:  You're sleeping through the war.
4393,Tyrion Lannister:  What?
4394,Bronn:  They stole a night's march on us. They're a mile north.
4395,Tyrion Lannister:  Get my squire!
4396,Bronn:  You don't have a squire.
4397,"Tyrion Lannister:  lf l die, weep for me."
4398,Shae:  You'll be dead. How will you know?
4399,Tyrion Lannister:  l'll know.

4404,Tyrion Lannister:  Stay low?
4405,"Bronn:  lf you're lucky, no one will notice you."
4406,"Tyrion Lannister:  l was born lucky. Tribesmen of the Vale, gather round! Stone Crows! Black Ears! Burned Men! Moon Brothers! And Painted Dogs! Your dominion over the Vale begins now! Onward, to claim what is yours!"
4407,Tribesmen of the Vale (chanting): Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man! Half man!
4408,Tyrion Lannister:  To battle!
4409,"NARRATOR:Tyrion rides to battle with the rest, but turns around quickly after and is hit with a mace from one of the Tribesmen. He passes out. Later, we cut to the end of the battle – dead bodies and swords piling on the ground. Tyrion wakes up to find Bronn talking to him as he’s carried on a wheelbarrow."
4410,Bronn:  You're a shit warrior.
4411,Tyrion Lannister:  l'm alive?
4412,Bronn:  You're alive.
4413,Tyrion Lannister:  Did we win?
4414,Bronn:  We wouldn't be having this conversation if we didn't.
4415,Tyrion Lannister:  How did our tribesmen do?
4416,"Bronn:  Yeah, good."
4417,Tyrion Lannister:  lt's nice to see them getting along.
4418,"NARRATOR:Tywin shows up next to them, fully armoured and on horseback."
4419,Tywin Lannister:  You're wounded.
4420,Tyrion Lannister:  Good of you to notice. l hear we won.
4421,"Tywin Lannister:  Huh! The scouts were wrong. There were 2,000 Stark bannermen, not 20 thousand."
4422,"Tyrion Lannister:  Did we get the Stark boy, at least?"
4423,Tywin Lannister:  He wasn't here.
4424,Tyrion Lannister:  Where was he?
4425,"Tywin Lannister:  With his other 18,000 men."
4426,Tyrion Lannister:  And where are they?
4427,NARRATOR:--------------
4428,NARRATOR:We cut to Catelyn and Rodrik Cassel overlooking the Trident from a safe distance at higher ground.
4429,"Rodrik Cassel:  We should go, my lady."
4430,Catelyn Stark:  No!
4431,Rodrik Cassel:  My lady!
4432,Stark bannermen:  Hyah! Hyah!
4433,"NARRATOR:The Stark host arrives at the clearing. Robb is amongst them, and he comes carrying a tied and bound Jaime Lannister."
4434,"Robb Stark:  By the time they knew what was happening, it had already happened."
4435,"Jaime Lannister:  Lady Stark. l'd offer you my sword, but l seem to have lost it."
4436,Catelyn Stark:  lt is not your sword l want. Give me my daughters back. Give me my husband.
4437,"Jaime Lannister:  l've lost them too, l'm afraid."
4438,"Theon Greyjoy:  Kill him, Robb. Send his head to his father. He cut down ten of our men. You saw him."
4439,Robb Stark:  He's more use to us alive than dead.
4440,Catelyn Stark:  Take him away and put him in irons.
4441,"Robb Stark:  lf we do it your way, Kingslayer, you'd win. We're not doing it your way."
4442,"Greatjon Umber:  Come on, pretty man."
4443,"Robb Stark:  l sent 2,000 men to their graves today."
4444,Theon Greyjoy:  The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice.
4445,Robb Stark:  Aye. But the dead won't hear them. (making a speech to his bannermen) One victory does not make us conquerors. Did we free my father? Did we rescue my sisters from the queen? Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees? This war is far from over.

4459,"NARRATOR:Arya follows the crowd to the Sept of Baelor. She climbs up the pedestal of Baelor’s statue to get a better view of her surroundings. We cut to Ned Stark being taken from the sept and into the courtyard, in full view of the gathered populace; Baelor’s statue is seen on the background to his left. Ned catches Arya’s eye at the foot of the statue."
4460,Populace:  Traitor! Coward!

4466,"Eddark Stark:  I am Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King. I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men. I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert. I swore to protect and defend his children, but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself. Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say: Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne, by the grace of all the Gods, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
4467,"Grand Maester Pycelle:  As we sin, so do we suffer. This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men. The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful. What is to be done with this traitor, Your Grace?"
4468,"Joffrey Baratheon:  My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Night's Watch. Stripped of all titles and powers, he would serve the realm in permanent exile. And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father. But they have the soft hearts of women. So long as I am your King, treason shall never go unpunished. Ser Ilyn, bring me his head!"
4469,NARRATOR:The townsfolk roar with approval; Arya leaves the pedestal and runs towards the commotion. Sansa gets visibly distraught and starts yelling as a member of the Kingsguard holds her back.
4470,"Sansa Stark:  No, stop! Please, someone stop him!"

4476,Yoren:  Shut your mouth. Look at me.
4477,"Sansa Stark:  Stop him, stop!"
4478,"NARRATOR:From Ned’s perspective, the roars of the crowd become almost silent; he looks towards Baelor’s statue but finds no one there. He lowers his head in recognition of his fate as the sound of Payne’s longsword cuts through the hushed silence. We see the sword swing until it reaches his head, with a direct cut to Arya as Yoren prevents her from seeing the actual execution. Arya looks at the sky; a flock of pigeons flies away from the courtyard as she holds her head against Yoren’s chest; she sighs heavily, and the screen cuts to black."

4504,SANSA: You can't!
4505,JOFFREY: What did you say? Did you say I can't?
4506,SANSA: I only meant… it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day.
4507,JOFFREY: What kind of stupid peasant's superstition...
4508,"THE HOUND: The girl is right. What a man sows on his name day, he reaps all year."

4543,"CERSEI: You command the City Watch, do you not, Lord Slynt?"
4544,"JANOS: I do, Your Grace."
4545,CERSEI: And are you not a Lord at my command?

4552,"TYRION: (Sits down) It's been a remarkable journey. I, (grabs a glass), pissed off the edge of the Wall, I slept in a sky cell. (Pours himself wine). I fought with the hill tribes. So many adventures, so much to be thankful for."

4561,"TYRION: If I were capable of tricking father, I'd be emperor of the world by now. You brought this on yourself. (Cersei sits down)."
4562,CERSEI: I've done nothing.
4563,TYRION: Quite right. You did nothing when your son called for Ned Stark's head. Now the entire North has risen up against us.
4564,CERSEI: I tried to stop it.
4565,TYRION: Did you? You failed. That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation.
4566,CERSEI: Robb Stark is a child.

4575,CERSEI: How?
4576,TYRION: You love your children. It's your one redeeming quality. That and your cheekbones. The Starks love their children as well. And we have two of them.
4577,CERSEI: One.
4578,TYRION: One?
4579,"CERSEI: Arya, little animal, she disappeared."
4580,"TYRION: Disappeared? What, in a puff of smoke? We had three Starks to trade. You chopped one's head off and let another escape. Father will be furious. It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child."

4588,"LORD: The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter. The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers. When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer. Men worked back then. Today, my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children. At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps. And the Gods forbid it rains. Why, I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall."
4589,LUWIN: Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast.
4590,"LORD: Generally, yes, but I've sent all the young men off to fight Robb Stark's war."
4591,BRAN: King Robb. And it's not his war. He didn't choose it.
4592,"LORD: Maybe not, My Lord, but he called in his Banners, and took the men."
4593,"BRAN: Joffrey killed my father, your liege lord. Do you remember your vows, Ser?"

4597,"LUWIN: We didn't want him here all day, did we?"
4598,BRAN: I didn't like the way he was talking about Robb.
4599,LUWIN: Nor did I. But listening to people you'd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell. (Bran sighs). Lord Portan.

4616,"OSHA: Did they? (Hodor is kneeling next to the pool in the godswood. Osha begins unstrapping Bran from Hodor’s back). I heard some other fools say it's Lannister Red. Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long. I heard a stable boy say it's the color of blood, to mark the death of your father."

4792,ROBB: You're held captive by a boy. Perhaps you'll be killed by a boy. (Grey Wind enters the cage. Jaime looks very nervous). Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros. King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon. (Jaime focuses back on Robb). He's your bastard son.

4794,ROBB: My father learned the truth. That's why you had him executed.
4795,JAIME: I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head.

4806,NARRATOR:Shae looks out from the balcony in Tyrion’s room.
4807,SHAE: This city stinks Like dead bodies.
4808,"TYRION: A bit corpsey, yes."
4809,SHAE: And shit.
4810,"NARRATOR:Shae hops down from the balcony, and walks back into the room."
4811,TYRION: I thought you wanted to come here.
4812,SHAE: I love it.
4813,TYRION: You love the smell of dead bodies and shit?
4814,SHAE: And cum and garlic and rum.
4815,TYRION: You can smell cum from the balcony?
4816,SHAE: I love the stink. I love the noise. Cities make me want to fuck.
4817,TYRION: And so did the country.
4818,NARRATOR:Shae lays back on Tyrion’s bed.
4819,SHAE: This is where I belong.
4820,"TYRION: Yes, well, you need to be careful. No one can know you're here."
4821,SHAE: No one will know.
4822,"TYRION: You can't trust anyone in King's Landing. They're all liars; good liars, bad liars, one or two great liars."
4823,SHAE: What about you?
4824,TYRION: Me? I'm not from here. I'm a slave to the truth.
4825,SHAE: Truth? (Laughs) You are the biggest little liar I have ever met.
4826,"TYRION: Why do you think I am so little? I'm being, (Lays down on the bed with Shae), crushed beneath the weight of all that truth."
4827,"TYRION: Ned Stark actually slept on this, as if the poor man didn't suffer enough. One of the many changes we'll have to make around here."
4828,NARRATOR:Tyrion and Shae kiss as a bell rings in the distance.
4829,NARRATOR:INT. HALLWAY
4830,"NARRATOR:A servant boy can be seen scrubbing something on the floor, as Baelish walks down a hallway next to a courtyard. Cersei and some kingsguard approach from behind."
4831,CERSEI: Lord Baelish.
4832,BAELISH: Your Grace.
4833,CERSEI: I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
4834,"BAELISH: Of course, Your Grace."
4835,CERSEI: Ned Stark's youngest daughter Arya... we can't seem to locate her.
4836,NARRATOR:Baelish begins walking with Cersei and her guards.
4837,"BAELISH: If she's escaped the capital, Winterfell seems the logical destination."
4838,CERSEI: And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her.
4839,BAELISH: Curious.
4840,"CERSEI: If we choose to negotiate with the Starks, the girl has some value. Whoever finds her, well, you know what they say about Lannisters and debts."
4841,"BAELISH: Well, you could ask Varys where she is. He'll have an answer for you. Whether you believe it,,, Myself, I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs. (Smiles) Who knows what they want?"
4842,"CERSEI: A mockingbird. (Points to a pin on Baelish’s shirt). You created your own Sigil, didn't you?"
4843,BAELISH: Yes.
4844,CERSEI: Appropriate for a self-made man with so many songs to sing.
4845,BAELISH: I'm glad you like it. Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family. Others have to find their own way.
4846,"CERSEI: I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family. He loved the eldest daughter. Sadly, she had eyes for another."
4847,"BAELISH: When boys and girls live in the same home, awkward situations can arise. Sometimes, I've heard, even brothers and sisters develop certain affections. And when these affections become common knowledge, well, that is an awkward situation, indeed. Especially in a prominent family. But prominent families often forget a simple truth, I've found."
4848,CERSEI: And which truth is that?
4849,BAELISH: Knowledge is power.
4850,CERSEI: Seize him. (Cersei’s guards seize Baelish). Cut his throat. (A guard holds a knife to Baelish’s neck). Stop. Wait. I've changed my mind. Let him go. (The guards let Baelish go). Step back three paces. Turn around. Close your eyes. (The guards do as Cersei says). (To Baelish) Power is power. Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me. I would very much appreciate it.
4851,"NARRATOR:Cersei walks away from Baelish, her guards following close behind. The servant boy scrubbing the floor looks up at Baelish."
4852,CUT TO: NORTH
4853,NARRATOR:INT. ROBB’S TENT
4854,ROBB: You're Ser Alton Lannister?
4855,"ALTON: I am, Your Grace."
4856,"ROBB: I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms. First, your family must release my sisters. Second, my father's bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell. And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned. Their families can honor them with proper funerals."
4857,"ALTON: An honorable request, Your Grace."
4858,"ROBB: Third... Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North. From this time, till the end of time, we are a free and independent kingdom."
4859,NARRATOR:Alton looks at him wide-eyed.
4860,SER RODRIK: The King in the North.
4861,THE OTHERS AT THE TABLE: King in the North.
4862,"ROBB: Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again. If he disregards this command, he shall suffer the same fate as my father, only I don't need a servant to do my beheading for me."
4863,"ALTON: These are... Your Grace, these are..."
4864,"ROBB: These are my terms. If the Queen Regent and her son meet them, I'll give them peace. If not, I will litter the south with Lannister dead."
4865,"ALTON: King Joffrey is a Baratheon, Your Grace."
4866,"ROBB: Oh, is he? You'll ride at daybreak, Ser Alton. That will be all for tonight."
4867,"NARRATOR:After everyone else leaves the tent, Theon approaches Robb."
4868,"THEON: A word, Your Grace?"
4869,ROBB: You don't have to call me ‘Your Grace’ when no one's around.
4870,THEON: It's not so bad once you get used to it.
4871,ROBB: I'm glad someone's gotten used to it.
4872,"THEON: The Lannisters are going to reject your terms, you know?"
4873,ROBB: Of course they are.
4874,"THEON: We can fight them in the fields as long as you like, but we won't beat them until you take King's Landing. And we can't take King's Landing without ships. My father has ships and men who know how to sail them."
4875,ROBB: Men who fought my father.
4876,"THEON: Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South, just like you're doing now. I'm his only living son. He'll listen to me. I know he will. I'm not a Stark. I know that. But your father raised me to be an honorable man. We can avenge him together."
4877,CATELYN: You don't want Balon Greyjoy for an ally.
4878,ROBB: I need his ships. They say he has 200.
4879,CATELYN: They say a million rats live in the sewers of King's Landing. Shall we rally them to fight for us?
4880,"NARRATOR:Catelyn is preparing to go somewhere, gathering up various items."
4881,ROBB: I understand you don't trust Lord Greyjoy.
4882,CATELYN: I don't trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy. Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion.
4883,"ROBB: Yes. And now I'm the one rebelling against the throne. Before me, it was father. You married one rebel and mothered another."
4884,"CATELYN: I mothered more than just rebels, a fact you seem to have forgotten."
4885,"ROBB: If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls, my bannermen will string me up by my feet."
4886,"CATELYN: You want to leave Sansa in the Queen's hands? And Arya, I haven't heard a word about Arya. What are we fighting for if not for them?"
4887,ROBB: It's more complicated than that! You know it is.
4888,NARRATOR:A long pause follows. Catelyn sits down.
4889,CATELYN: It's time for me to go home. I haven't seen Bran or Rickon in months.
4890,ROBB: You can't go to Winterfell.
4891,CATELYN: I beg your pardon?
4892,"ROBB: I'll send Rodrik to watch over the boys, ‘cause tomorrow, you'll ride south to the Stormlands."
4893,CATELYN: Why in the name of all the Gods -
4894,"ROBB: Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon. He's rallied an army of 100,000. You know him. You know his family."
4895,CATELYN: I haven't seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy. You have a hundred other lords -
4896,"ROBB: Which of these lords do I trust more than you? If Renly sides with us, we'll outnumber them two to one. When they feel the jaws beginning to shut, they'll sue for peace. We'll get the girls back. Then we'll all go home for good."
4897,CATELYN: I will ride at first light.
4898,"NARRATOR:Robb kisses Catelyn’s forehead, and they embrace."
4899,"ROBB: We will all be together again soon, I promise."
4900,CATELYN: You've done so well. Your father would be proud.
4901,ROBB: (Pauses) Give Lord Renly my regards.
4902,CATELYN: King Renly. There's a king in every corner now.

4904,NARRATOR:INT. THRONE ROOM
4905,"NARRATOR:Cersei and her guards enter the throne room. Extensive work is being done, overseen by Joffrey."
4906,CERSEI: What is all this?
4907,"JOFFREY: Returning this room to its proper appearance. Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors. That is a seat for a conqueror. It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers."
4908,CERSEI: We can't find Arya Stark.
4909,"JOFFREY: With luck, she's dead in a ditch somewhere."
4910,"CERSEI: Perhaps. But if not, we need her. They'll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone."
4911,JOFFREY: I think they might. They're weak. They put too much value on their women. (Walks towards the throne).
4912,CERSEI: We need to set our armies to the task of finding her. Send out as many men as we can. I'm sure if you asked grandfather -
4913,JOFFREY: The King does not ask; He commands. And my grandfather's stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place.
4914,CERSEI: His life is in danger.
4915,JOFFREY: We're at war. All our lives are in danger. I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime. And you.
4916,CERSEI: Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne.
4917,JOFFREY: It's not a claim. The throne is mine.
4918,CERSEI: Of course it is. No one believes this foul gossip -
4919,JOFFREY: Someone believes it. Father had other children? Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella?
4920,CERSEI: What are you asking?
4921,JOFFREY: I'm asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you. How many bastards does he have running -
4922,"NARRATOR:Cersei instinctively slaps Joffrey. It grows quiet as many workers look over at Joffrey and Cersei. Joffre looks up shocked, and then around to the workers in the room. Cersei appears nervous."
4923,"JOFFREY: What you just did is punishable by death. You will never do it again. Never. (Joffrey begins to walk away). That will be all, Mother."

4927,"NARRATOR:The man and woman go back to having sex, this time with the woman slowly moaning."
4928,ROZ: Go wash yourselves. Put some clothes on. Both of you are working tonight.
4929,NARRATOR:Roz walks Daisy through the brothel.
4930,"ROZ: We do things differently here, Daisy. This isn't some five-copper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall."
4931,DAISY: Haystack Hall.
4932,ROZ: Wherever you're from. Our establishment doesn't cater to ploughmen and goat herders. (Nods to a man walking past). Lord Olsen. Taste is everything here.
4933,DAISY: Littlefinger's a fancy man.
4934,"ROZ: Don't call him Littlefinger, he doesn't like it. Lord Baelish."
4935,"NARRATOR:As they enter a new room, a prostitute and two men with her get up to leave."
4936,ROZ: She pretends she doesn't speak the common tongue so that people will think she's exotic. She grew up just down the road in flea bottom.
4937,DAISY: She's beautiful.
4938,"ROZ: She's a dumb slut, really, but a lid for every pot. (Janos enters the room). Lord Commander. Good to see you, again."
4939,"NARRATOR:Janos is followed by a number of gold cloaks, some of whom are dragging along a prisoner. Some leave to search other rooms."
4940,"ROZ: You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish, the King's Master of Coin. Coin which goes in many pockets."
4941,JANOS: Orders.
4942,ROZ: Whose orders?
4943,JANOS: Someone who doesn't care what Littlefinger thinks.
4944,"MHAEGAN: No, you can't!"
4945,"NARRATOR:Some gold cloaks force Mhaegan and her baby, Barra, into the room. She begins crying. The prisoner looks at Barra, and back to Janos. He then nods. A gold cloak lets go of the prisoner and takes the Barra from Mhaegan."
4946,MHAEGAN: No! Please! No! Not my Barra! Please. Please.
4947,"NARRATOR:The gold cloak holds a knife to the baby’s throat, hesitantly. Throughout the whole ordeal, Mhaegan continues begging for Barra’s life."
4948,JANOS: Enough. Get it done. Kill the bastard.
4949,"NARRATOR:After a moment, Janos takes out a knife and grabs the baby."
4950,JANOS: Give it here.

4965,"BLACKSMITH: The Night's Watch! Please, stop!"
4966,JANOS: Where?
4967,"BLACKSMITH: They took him up the Kingsroad, heading north!"
4968,JANOS: How will we know him?

4978,TYRION: Pod! Find Bronn or Varys. Tell them I am here with Maester Pycelle. Tell them I am very much alive.
4979,"PODRICK: Yes, my lord."
4980,PYCELLE: Would you like something for the pain?
4981,TYRION: What happened?
4982,PYCELLE: The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father.
4983,TYRION: Where am I?
4984,"PYCELLE: These are your new chambers. A little cramped, perhaps, but you don't need much room, do you? You are no longer Hand of the King."
4985,NARRATOR:PYCELLE turns and begins to leave. A thought occurs to him. He takes out a coin and flicks it to Tyrion

5001,"LORAS: Your Grace, my sister Margaery, her husband was taken from us before . . . She remains innocent. I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses."
5002,"JOFFREY: Is this what you want, Lady Margaery?"
5003,NARRATOR:MARGAERY takes a few steps forward.
5004,"MARGAERY: With all my heart, Your Grace. I have come to love you from afar. Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears. And those tales have taken root deep inside of me."
5005,"JOFFREY: I, too, have heard tales of your beauty and grace, but the tales do not do you justice, my lady. It would be an honor to return your love, but I am promised to another. A king must keep his word."
5006,"CERSEI: Your Grace, in the judgment of your Small Council, it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason, a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak. For the good of the realm, your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside."
5007,NARRATOR:The crowd murmurs.

5009,NARRATOR:JOFFREY stands and gestures to quiet the crowd.
5010,"JOFFREY: I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people, but I took a holy vow."
5011,"PYCELLE: Your Grace, the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn, but your father, blessed be his memory, made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness. I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods."
5012,NARRATOR:CERSEI looks across to SANSA. CERSEI is pleased and SANSA is quite worried.
5013,"JOFFREY: The gods are good. I am free to heed my heart. Ser Loras, I will gladly wed your sweet sister. You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day."

5016,LITTLEFINGER: My lady. My sincerest condolences.
5017,SANSA: They're right. I'm not good enough for him.
5018,"LITTLEFINGER: You shouldn't say that. You'll be good enough for many things. He'll still enjoy beating you. And now that you're a woman, he'll be able to enjoy you in other ways as well."
5019,"SANSA: But, if he's not marrying me"
5020,"LITTLEFINGER: He'll let you go home? Joffrey's not the sort of boy who gives away his toys. You have a tender heart, just like your mother did at your age. I can see so much of her in you. She was like a sister to me. For her sake, I'll help get you home."
5021,SANSA: King's Landing is my home now.

5043,ROS: I know who you are.
5044,"VARYS: And, unlike your current employer, I protect those who work for me. I don't abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other."
5045,ROS: How do you know about that?
5046,VARYS:  I thought you said you knew who I was.
5047,"ROS: What can I do for you, Lord Varys?"
5048,VARYS: Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes. I see a potential partner.
5049,ROS: I'm afraid of him.

5055,BRIENNE: Walk.

5057,BRIENNE: One or two tried.
5058,"JAIME: Ah. But you fought them off. But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you, fling you down, tear off your clothes. But none of them were strong enough. I'm strong enough."
5059,BRIENNE:  Not interested.
5060,JAIME: Of course you are. You'd love to know what it feels like to be a woman.
5061,NARRATOR:They encounter three hanged women in the trees.
5062,"JAIME: Ah. ""They lay with lions."" Tavern girls, I'd say. Probably served my father's soldiers. Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel. That's how they earned this. The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters. Must make you proud to serve the Starks."
5063,BRIENNE: I don't serve the Starks. I serve Lady Catelyn.

5087,MAN #2: What did he do?
5088,JAIME: Apparently eating is now a crime. Who knew?
5089,"BRIENNE: No, stealing is a crime."
5090,JAIME: But it's not a crime to starve. That's justice for you.
5091,MAN: Where are you taking him?
5092,BRIENNE: To Riverrun.
5093,MAN #2: Why Riverrun?
5094,NARRATOR:BRIENNE works to unbind JAIME from the tree.
5095,"BRIENNE: Steal from the Tullys, it's their dungeons you rot in."
5096,MAN #2: Why not kill him?

5115,MAN #2: Wait. I do know you. That's Jaime Lannister.
5116,JAIME: I wish someone had told me. I wouldn't have had to steal that pig.
5117,"BRIENNE: If this is the Kingslayer, I think I'd know about it."
5118,MAN: How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like?
5119,MAN #2: I was at Whispering Wood. I saw him. They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king.
5120,"BRIENNE: He's not the Kingslayer. Sorry to disappoint you. If he was, I'd only be traveling his head."
5121,"NARRATOR:Again, they try to move along."

5135,CATELYN: I know that seems important to you.
5136,ROBB: It is important to me.
5137,"CATELYN: Your father didn't love me when we married. He hardly knew me or I him. Love didn't just happen to us. We built it slowly over the years, stone by stone, for you, for your brothers and sisters, for all of us. It's not as exciting as secret passion in the woods, but it is stronger. It lasts longer."
5138,"ROBB: And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Frey's daughters,  what you and father had?"
5139,CATELYN: Why not? Because she's not beautiful? Because she's not exotic and exciting?
5140,ROBB: Now you're arguing just to argue because you arranged it.
5141,"CATELYN: And you agreed to it. You gave him your word. Treat your oaths recklessly, and your people will do the same. If your father lived his life for one thing"

5147,MELISANDRE: l I did. I still see it.
5148,"STANNIS:  The flames lied. And I'm no better than a savage trusting in a fire god. I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay. I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive, and for what? Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells. If you see so much in your flames, why didn't you warn me?"
5149,MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses.
5150,STANNIS: You claimed to speak for a god.

You will betray everything you once held dear. And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire. You are the Warrior of Light. You will sweep aside this pretender and that one. You will be king.
5167,"STANNIS: You promise these things, but you don't know. None of us know."
5168,MELISANDRE: Let me show you.
5169,NARRATOR:She leads him over to the fire.
5170,"MELISANDRE: Look into the fire, my king. Look."

5177,LUWIN: They want you to know you're surrounded.
5178,THEON: I know I'm surrounded. I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded.
5179,LUWIN: They don't want you to sleep. They want to sap your spirit before

5187,THEON: The first time I saw Winterfell
5188,NARRATOR:The horn blows again. THEON rolls his eyes in anger.
5189,"THEON: First time I saw Winterfell, it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead. I saw it and I thought, ""Of course, Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers. ""We never stood a chance against the man who lives here."""
5190,LUWIN: Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home.
5191,"THEON: Yes, my captors were so very kind to me. You love reminding me of that. Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that. You know what it's like to be told how lucky you are to be someone's prisoner? To be told how much you owe them? And then to go back home to your real father"
5192,NARRATOR:The horn sounds again. THEON gets up in a fury. He shakes his fist at the window.

5195,"THEON: And what's your counsel, trusted friend?"
5196,LUWIN: Run.
5197,LUWIN: Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls. You have 20 men. You can't win. Wait for nightfall and run.
5198,"THEON: There's nowhere to run. I'd never make it back to the Iron Islands. And even if I did, even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home, I'd be a coward. The Greyjoy who ran. The shame of the family."
5199,NARRATOR:THEON sits again.
5200,LUWIN: Don't go home. Join the Night's Watch.
5201,NARRATOR:LUWIN leans over THEON's shoulder.
5202,"LUWIN: Once a man has taken the black, he's beyond reach of the law. All his past crimes are forgiven."
5203,THEON: I won't make it to the Wall. I won't make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates.
5204,LUWIN: There are ways. Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape. The road will be dangerous. But with a little luck...
5205,NARRATOR:LUWIN faces THEON
5206,"LUWIN: The Night's Watch is an ancient, honorable order. You'll have opportunities there."
5207,NARRATOR:THOEN rises.
5208,THEON: The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep.
5209,LUWIN: The opportunity to make amends for what you've done.
5210,"THEON: I've done a lot, haven't I? Things I never imagined myself doing."
5211,"LUWIN: I've known you many years, Theon Greyjoy. You're not the man you're pretending to be. Not yet."
5212,THEON: You may be right. But I've gone too far to pretend to be anything else.

5215,"NARRATOR:THEON stands in the Winterfell courtyard, addressing his men."

5217,NARRATOR:The ironborn men laugh.
5218,THEON: They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland.
5219,MEN: Aye!
5220,THEON: You think they're right?
5221,BLACK LORREN: Aye.
5222,"THEON: We die today, brothers. We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts, but our war cries will echo through eternity. They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves. Every man, woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood. Aggar and Gelmarr, Wex and Urzen, Stygg and Black Lorren. Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle."
5223,MEN: Aye!

5246,TYRION: To create strife between my sister and me.
5247,"VARYS: Where before there was nothing but love. Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sister's orders. If it weren't for your squire's bravery, you'd be a dead man."
5248,TYRION: Pod.
5249,"PODRICK: Yes, my lord?"
5250,TYRION: Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week?
5251,"PODRICK: No, my lord."
5252,"TYRION: You're a good lad. Get Bronn, tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times."
5253,PODRICK: (nods)
5254,VARYS: I'm afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch. The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister. It varies from cloak to cloak.
5255,TYRION: Then my hill tribesmen.
5256,"VARYS: Have gone home. Your father paid them quite handsomely. I'm afraid we won't be seeing each other for some time, my lord."

5274,TYRION: Well?
5275,SHAE: You are a mess.
5276,TYRION: I'm a monster as well as a dwarf. You should charge me double.
5277,SHAE:  You think I'm here for money?
5278,TYRION: That was the arrangement we made. I pay you and you lie to me.
5279,"SHAE: Oh. I'm a poor little rich man and nobody loves me, so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh. Fuck your money. Let's leave."
5280,TYRION: Leave?
5281,"SHAE:  Leave King's Landing. They tried to kill you. They will try again. Going into wars, fighting soldiers, you're terrible at this. Let's take a boat to Pentos and never come back. You don't belong here."

5283,"SHAE: Eat, drink, fuck, live."
5284,TYRION: I want to go with you.

5680,"JON: If it's a boy what? (Gilly looks around and then down, not answering). You want us to risk our lives for you, and you won't even tell us why."
5681,"NARRATOR:Gilly looks taken aback, and then runs off."
5682,SAM: Why did you do that?
5683,"JON: Do what, ask her a question?"
5684,SAM: You were cruel.
5685,JON: Cruel! Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand?
5686,SAM: I didn't touch her!
5687,JON: No you just want to steal her. What do you think Craster cuts off for that?
5688,"SAM: I can't steal her, she's a person not a goat."
5689,"JON: We're heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory. We can't take a girl with us. Mormont wouldn't have it. And even if he would, what would we do with her? Who's gonna deliver her baby? You?"
5690,"SAM: I could try. (Jon looks down, annoyed). What? I've read about it. A bit."

Some hair can be seen poking out of the top. Flies can be heard buzzing. Jorah feels the hair, and Daenerys gets up from where she was sitting to approach the horse. Jorah pulls the object in the sack out a little bit by the hair, revealing it to be a human head. He then puts it back in the sack. Jorah picks up the ponytail of the head, which has been cut off."

5707,IRRI: (Speaking Dothraki) They did! They butchered him like an animal. They did not burn his body. (Daenerys kneels to Irri’s level). He can never join his ancestors in the night lands.

5715,WOMAN: Is it as you remember my lord?
5716,THEON: (Removes his jacket). Looks smaller.
5717,"WOMAN: Everything looks bigger when you're a child. I remember my father's cabin, felt like a palace when I was little. Now look at it."
5718,THEON: (Removes more of his clothes). They'll be waiting for me on the docks.
5719,WOMAN: Who will?
5720,"THEON: Anyone who matters, (Takes off his shirt), this is a big day for them. They haven't had much to get excited about since I left. It's a hard place the Iron Islands always has been. It's cold and it's wet."
5721,WOMAN: I love the cold and wet.
5722,"THEON: They say hard places breed hard men, (Unbuttons his pants), and hard men rule the world."
5723,WOMAN: Then you'll be king before long.
5724,"THEON: (Kneels down). Try smiling with your lips closed. (She does). Hmm, better."
5725,NARRATOR:Theon stands up and roughly pushes her back onto the bed.
5726,WOMAN: My father doesn't trust you Iron islanders.
5727,THEON: (Taking off his pants). I don't blame him.

5729,NARRATOR:The woman groans as they begin having sex.
5730,"THEON: Quit talking about your father. He's right about us. Our wives from the Iron Islands, they're for breeding. That's not enough for us. That's why we take saltwives, from the women we capture."
5731,WOMAN: Capture me! Take me with you when you go ashore. Make me your saltwife.
5732,THEON: Your place is on this ship.

He holds some keys in his hand, which are jingling as he pushes the prostitute’s head. Baelish, in turn, is watching this man. He hears a noise and turns around, then covers the hole he was watching through. A man emerges from another room. A woman can be heard crying from inside."
5739,"MAN: I barely touched her. And you charge twice as much as every other brothel. And this is what I get, crying."
5740,"BAELISH: One moment, my friend. A moment."

5743,"NARRATOR:Upon seeing Ramka, the man smiles. As they begin to kiss passionately, Baelish goes to investigate the crying woman. He enters the room to see Roz, curled up on the bed, crying. He walks over to her, putting a hand on her back, and then sits next to her."
5744,"ROZ: I’m sorry, my lord."
5745,BAELISH: Shhh. Did he hurt you?
5746,"ROZ: No, my lord… It’s Mhaegen."
5747,BAELISH: Who?
5748,"ROZ: She works for you. She's the one, the girl whose, they killed her baby."
5749,"BAELISH: Ah, yes, that was poorly handled. Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace."
5750,"ROZ: Can't stop thinking about it, I can't sleep. Her poor little baby."
5751,"BAELISH: You know, you remind me of another girl. A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house. Beautiful, like yourself, and intelligent as yourself. But she wasn't happy. She cried, often. I asked her why but, we didn't have the kind of rapport that you and I have. Yes, it was quite sad. Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive. Extremely expensive. And this one wasn't making me any money. I hate bad investments. Really, I do. They haunt me. I had no idea how to make her happy, no idea how to mitigate my losses. A very wealthy patron, he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely, sad girl. To use her in ways that never occur to most men. And you know what occurs to most men. I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated. (Stands up). Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegen’s child. I’ll see you tomorrow. But you’ll be happy?

5760,"JANOS: Hmm, that's a good red. Dornish?"
5761,"TYRION: You know your wines, my lord."

5767,TYRION: I heard there was some trouble in Littlefinger's brothel the other night.
5768,"JANOS: Hmm. Nasty business, had to be done."
5769,"TYRION: Yes, of course. City Watch must keep the peace. Only, I hadn't realized peace depended on killing babies."
5770,JANOS: Orders are orders.
5771,TYRION: Quite right. Especially the queen's orders.
5772,JANOS: I never said they were the queen's orders.
5773,"TYRION: No, but who else would want to murder King Robert's bastards? She's always been a jealous woman."
5774,JANOS: You know your sister better than I do.
5775,TYRION: You've heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister.
5776,JANOS: I don't listen to filth.
5777,"TYRION: That's good of you, but you have heard them. I suppose people who do believe that filth, consider Robert's bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cersei's children."
5778,"JANOS: Joffrey is my king, the rest doesn't interest me. (Sips his wine)."
5779,TYRION: I appreciate your loyalty. Tell me.
5780,"NARRATOR:When your men slaughtered Ned Stark's men in the throne room, did you give the order?"
5781,JANOS: I did. And I would again. The man was a traitor. He tried to buy my loyalty.
5782,TYRION: The fool! He had no idea you were already bought.
5783,JANOS: Are you drunk? I'll not have my honor questioned by an Imp.
5784,"TYRION: I'm not questioning your honor, Lord Janos. I'm denying its existence."
5785,"JANOS: You think I'll stand here and take this from you, dwarf."
5786,"TYRION: Dwarf? You should have stopped at imp. And yes, you will stand here and take it from me, unless you'd like to take it from my friend here."
5787,"NARRATOR:Tyrion gestures towards Bronn, who has appeared in the room."
5788,"TYRION: I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war, and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King, well, I just wouldn't feel safe with you lurking about."
5789,TYRION: The queen regent. And you're a fool to believe she's your friend.
5790,JANOS: We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this.
5791,"TYRION: No, we shan't."
5792,"NARRATOR:Tyrion nods at Bronn, who gestures for some armed men to enter the room."
5793,"TYRION: There's a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight. From there, I'm afraid it's rather a long walk to Castle Black. I hope you enjoy the Wall. I found it surprisingly beautiful, in a brutal, horribly uncomfortable sort of way."
5794,"BRONN: The lads will escort you. The streets aren't safe at night, my lord."
5795,JANOS: These men are under my command. (Bronn laughs). I command you to arrest this cutthroat.

5811,HOT PIE: I've seen lots of battles. I saw -
5812,ARYA: Liar.
5813,HOT PIE: I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom. Stabbed him right in the neck.
5814,LOMMY: Two men fighting isn't a battle.
5815,HOT PIE: They had armor on.
5816,ARYA: So?
5817,"HOT PIE: So, if they got armor on, it's a battle."
5818,"LOMMY: No, it isn't."
5819,HOT PIE: What's a dyer's apprentice know about battles anyway?
5820,"ARYA: (Gendry walks over to get more water). Gendry's an armorer's apprentice. Hot Pie, tell Gendry what makes it a battle."
5821,HOT PIE: (Hesitates) It's when they've got armor on.
5822,GENDRY: Now who told you that.

5824,GENDRY: How'd you know he was a knight?
5825,"HOT PIE: Well, cause he got armor on."
5826,GENDRY: You don't have to be a knight to have armor. Any idiot can buy armor. (Arya smiles).

5835,"GENDRY:  Well, I don’t care what any of them want. No good's ever come of their questions."
5836,ARYA: No good's ever come? Who asked questions before?
5837,GENDRY: How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass?
5838,ARYA: Who asked questions?
5839,"GENDRY: The Hand of the King. Er, hands of the King. Lord Arryn came first, a few weeks before he died. And then Lord Stark came, a few weeks before he died."
5840,ARYA: Lord Stark.
5841,GENDRY: See? Asking me questions is bad luck. (Walks back to river). You'll probably be dead soon.

5848,ARYA: I'm not a girl!
5849,GENDRY: (Walks back to camp fire). Yes you are. You think I'm as stupid as the rest of them?
5850,"ARYA: Stupider. Night's Watch doesn't take girls, everyone knows that."
5851,GENDRY: That's true. You're still a girl.

5951,"DAVOS: Of course you do. Every time you leave harbor, you're leaving on a promise. A promise that somewhere on the seas, somebody's got some gold and you can take it from them."
5952,SAAN: That's a promise that always comes true.
5953,"DAVOS: As is mine. You're not the young man, Salladhor. And correct me if I'm wrong: Most pirates don't grow old."
5954,SAAN: Only the clever ones.
5955,"DAVOS: You want to spend your last few years on the sea, stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants, then go. They're out there waiting for you. That's easy. What I'm offering you is hard. Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros. You'll be the richest man in Lysene. And the most famous. They'll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing."
5956,SAAN: Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs.
5957,DAVOS: It is. (Matthos rolls his eyes).
5958,"SAAN: One thing, I want the queen."
5959,DAVOS: The queen?
5960,"SAAN: Cersei, I want her. I'll sail with your fleet, all 30 of my ships, and if we don't drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay, I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well."
5961,MATTHOS: This war isn't about you. We're not attacking King's Landing so that you can rape the queen.
5962,"SAAN: I'm not going to rape her, I'm going to fuck her."
5963,MATTHOS: As if she would just let you!
5964,SAAN: You don't know how persuasive I am. I never tried to fuck you.
5965,"MATTHOS: Stannis is the rightful king, and the Lord of Light. The one true god."
5966,"SAAN: I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the true god. They all think they found the right one. The one true god is what's between a woman's legs, and better yet a queen's legs."
5967,NARRATOR:Matthos walks away angrily. Saan turns back to Davos.
5968,SAAN: I never thought you'd have a true believer for a son.
5969,DAVOS: He's young yet. I promise you the gold. I promise you the glory. I cannot promise you the queen.
5970,MATTHOS: You believe your king can win?
5971,DAVOS: He is the one true king.
5972,"SAAN: You Westerosee are funny people. A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him. (They laugh). I'll sail with you, Davos Seaworth. You are the most honest smuggler I ever met. Make me rich."
5973,DAVOS: Get me to the gates of King's Landing and I will.
5974,NARRATOR:They shake hands. Davos pats Saan on the back as he walks away. Saan and Matthos eye each other as Saan walks past. Matthos walks back over to his father.
5975,MATTHOS: When will the King have a sail?
5976,DAVOS: As soon as his God wills it.
5977,"MATTHOS: He's my God too, and yours. But you were too blind to see. (As they walk). Let me teach you how to read."
5978,DAVOS: Oh you and your mother.
5979,MATTHOS: It won't take long. You already know the letters. The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be.
5980,"DAVOS: I wish I had a God, truly! I'm not mocking you, but I've seen men pray to every God there is. Pray for wind, pray for rain, pray for home. None of it works!"
5981,MATTHOS: But you always came home.
5982,DAVOS: I wasn't praying.
5983,"MATTHOS: (They reach their horses). But I was. Every night that you were at sea, I lit a candle and I prayed, for you."
5984,"DAVOS: You want me to have a god, fine. King Stannis is my god. He raised me up and blessed me with his trust. He gave you a future I could never have imagined. You know how to read, you'll be a knight someday. You think your fire god commanded all that? It was Stannis. Only Stannis."
5985,"MATTHOS: (As Davos is mounting his horse). Stannis is my king, but he's only a man."
5986,DAVOS: Don't tell him that.

5991,CERSEI: Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch. You had no right to exile him.
5992,TYRION: I have every right. I am the King's Hand.
5993,CERSEI: You're serving as the King's Hand until father gets here. I am Queen Regent.
5994,"TYRION: Listen to me, Queen Regent, you're losing the people. Do you hear me?"
5995,"CERSEI: Ha, the people. You think I care?"
5996,"TYRION: You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead. Half the city will starve when winter comes. The other half will plot to overthrow you. And your gold-plated thugs just gave them the rallying cry, “The Queen slaughters babies.” (Cersei says nothing). You don't even have the decency to deny it."
5997,"NARRATOR:Cersei looks down and walks toward the window. Tyrion looks down, and then up at her."
5998,"TYRION: It wasn't you who gave the order, was it? Joffrey didn't even tell you. Or did he tell you? I imagine that would be even worse."
5999,"CERSEI: He did what needed to be done. (Now loudly). You want to be the Hand of the King? You want to rule? This is what ruling is! Lying on a bed of weeds, ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep."
6000,"TYRION: I'm no king, but I think there's more to ruling that that."
6001,"CERSEI: I don't care what you think! You've never taken it seriously. You haven't, Jaime hasn't. (Sits down). It's all fallen on me."
6002,"TYRION: (Tries not to laugh). As has Jaime repeatedly, according to Stannis Baratheon."
6003,"CERSEI: You're funny. (Laughs). You've always been funny. But none of your jokes will ever match the first one, will they? You remember... back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death."
6004,TYRION: She was my mother too.

6010,MATTHOS: Your Grace.
6011,STANNIS: How did it fare with your pirate?
6012,DAVOS: Salladhor Saan will join our fleet. 30 ships. His men know how to fight.
6013,"STANNIS: In my experience, pirates prefer fighting unarmed men."
6014,DAVOS: Does seem the wiser choice.
6015,STANNIS: It won't be a choice this time. Do you trust him?
6016,"DAVOS: Salladhor Saan is an old friend, I've known him 30 years. I've never trusted him."
6017,"NARRATOR:But once he gets the smell of gold, he never stops."
6018,"STANNIS: Well if he does his job, he'll have his share. Leave us."
6019,"DAVOS: At once, Your Grace."

6023,DAVOS: Come.
6024,STANNIS: What did you say to him?
6025,MELISANDRE: I told him death by fire is the purest death.
6026,STANNIS: Why?
6027,MELISANDRE: Because it is true. You're troubled my king.
6028,STANNIS: Yeah.
6029,MELISANDRE: These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light.
6030,STANNIS: Tell your lord to burn them then.
6031,MELISANDRE: I tell him nothing! I pray for his commands and I obey.
6032,STANNIS: My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts. Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me.
6033,MELISANDRE: You must have faith.
6034,"STANNIS: Faith? In a real war, the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten."
6035,MELISANDRE: Then we must be the ten.
6036,"STANNIS: I cannot defeat my brother in the field, and I can't take King's Landing without the men he stole."
6037,"MELISANDRE: I have seen the path to victory in the flames. At first, you must give yourself to the Lord of Light."
6038,"STANNIS: I've said the words, damn you! I burnt the idols."
6039,MELISANDRE: You must give... all of yourself.
6040,NARRATOR:Melisandre disrobes next to Stannis. He looks over and then looks away.
6041,STANNIS: I have a wife. I took a vow.
6042,"MELISANDRE: She's sick. Weak. Shut away in the tower. And she disgusts you. And she's given you nothing. No sons. Only stillborns. Only death. (Whispers in his ear). I will give you a son, my King."
6043,STANNIS: (Gasps). A son?

6066,NARRATOR:JEOR stares back mutely.
6067,JON: You know.
6068,JEOR: Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I. Those boys are Craster's offerings.
6069,JON: Offerings? He's murdering his own children. He's a monster.
6070,"JEOR: Aye, many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers, your uncle among them. We have other wars to fight out there. Like it or not, we need men like Craster."
6071,JON: I saw it. I saw something take that child.
6072,"JEOR: Yeah. Whatever it was, I daresay you'll see it again. Now, ready my horse. We leave at dawn."

6080,GILLY: I can't take it.
6081,SAM: Please. I want you to. My mother used it for sewing. She'd let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and I'd read to her. My father put a stop to it when he found out. It's the only thing I have of hers. She gave it to me before I left for the Wall.

I'm running through the godswood, sniffing the dirt, tasting blood in my mouth when I've made a fresh kill, howling. Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags, birds, wolves."
6093,BRAN: So she was lying? They don't exist?
6094,"LUWIN: Well, they may have done. But they're gone from the world, along with much else. These are dreams, Bran, nothing more."
6095,"BRAN: No, my dreams are different. Mine are true. I dreamt of my father dying. And Rickon had the same dream."
6096,LUWIN: What about all the dreams you had that didn't come true? Hmm? Right.
6097,NARRATOR:Luwin shows his chain to Bran.
6098,"LUWIN: This link is made of Valyrian steel. Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain. It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries. And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells. I was no different. I was young. And what boy doesn't secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one? But in the end, for all my efforts, I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me. Come on."

6116,"RENLY: That he did, my queen. But there can only be one champion. Brienne of Tarth, you may ask anything of me you desire. If it is within my power, it is yours."

6130,"CATELYN: It will be enough to know that justice was done, my lord. Your Grace."
6131,BRIENNE: And you should kneel when you approach the King.
6132,RENLY: There's no need for that. Lady Stark is an honored guest.

6148,RENLY: Why?
6149,CATELYN: Because it won't last. Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming.
6150,"RENLY: Brienne, escort Lady Catelyn to her tent. She's tired from her journey."

6173,"BALON: The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back. While he's tangling with the lion in the Westerlands, the North is ripe for the taking. The ironborn will reave and pillage, as it was in the old days, all along the northern coast. We'll spread our dominion across the green lands, securing the Neck and everything above. Every stronghold will yield to us, one by one. Winterfell may defy us for a year, but what of it? The rest shall be ours, forest, field, and hall. Yara, my daughter, you'll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte."
6174,YARA: I've always wanted a castle.

6183,"BALON: Your brothers were warriors, both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect."
6184,"THEON: I'm not protecting anyone. I just wonder if it's not wiser to wait. Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies? Rise up against them and they could destroy us. But if we pledge fealty to them, they'll give us Casterly Rock."
6185,BALON: What are our words? Our words?
6186,THEON: We do not sow.
6187,BALON: We do not sow. We are ironborn. We're not subjects. We're not slaves. We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine. We take what is ours. Your time with the wolves has made you weak.
6188,"THEON: You act as if I volunteered to go. You gave me away, if you remember. The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon. After he crushed you. Did you take what was yours then?"

6236,SHAE: No.
6237,NARRATOR:They pause.
6238,SANSA: What are you doing?
6239,SHAE: Waiting for you to tell me what to do.
6240,SANSA: I shouldn't have to tell you to do things. You should just do them.
6241,SHAE: What things?
6242,"SANSA: Change my linens, wash my clothing, scrub the floor, empty my chamber pot, brush my hair."
6243,NARRATOR:Shae closes the door and picks up a brush to comb Sansa's hair. Sansa stops her.
6244,SANSA: No.
6245,SHAE: You said to brush
6246,SANSA: Not now.
6247,SHAE: Your chamber pot is empty.
6248,SANSA: Clean the table. Have you ever been a handmaiden before?
6249,SHAE: Yes.
6250,SANSA: For whom?
6251,SHAE: Lady Zuriff.
6252,SANSA: Lady Zuriff
6253,SHAE: Lady Zuriff.
6254,SANSA: There is no Lady Zuriff in this city.
6255,SHAE: She wasn't in this city.
6256,"SANSA: I don't know how they did things in that city, but in this city, handmaidens wait on ladies, not the other way around. And I don't have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job."
6257,SHAE: Do you want me to leave?
6258,SANSA: Just brush my hair.
6259,NARRATOR:Shae brushes her hair in silence.
6260,"INT: Tyrion's chambers, daytime."
6261,NARRATOR:Pycelle hands Tyrion some medicine.
6262,TYRION: Oh! Thank the gods. I haven't had a proper shit in six days.
6263,"PYCELLE: I've encountered this problem before, my lord. The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect. Two drops with water, daily."
6264,TYRION: Right. I'm so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side.
6265,"PYCELLE: Please. Thank you, my lord."
6266,"TYRION: I can trust you, Pycelle, can I not?"
6267,"PYCELLE: Why, yes, of course, my lord."
6268,TYRION: These are perilous times. And the crown must forge new alliances. And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony.
6269,"PYCELLE: Matrimony, huh? Yes."
6270,"TYRION: I'm trusting the council with these plans, but the Queen mustn't know. We can't have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm. There's too much at stake."
6271,"PYCELLE: Oh, yes, yes. Indeed, yes. I shall be silent as the grave."
6272,NARRATOR:Tyrion walks to pour a drink.
6273,"TYRION: I'm brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne. Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age, ensuring their loyalty and their army, should we need it."
6274,PYCELLE: Myrcella sent away to Dorne?
6275,"INT: Tyrion's chambers, daytime, though we do not realize at first that it is later."
6276,"TYRION: But remember, the Queen mustn't know."
6277,"VARYS: Ooh. ""The Queen mustn't know."" I love conversations that begin this way."
6278,TYRION: I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy.
6279,"VARYS: Theon Greyjoy? Forgive me, my lord, but how? He grew up a ward of Winterfell. He fights for Robb Stark."
6280,TYRION: Precisely. Theon's father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side. Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his father's ships.
6281,"INT: Tyrion's chambers, again we do not realize at first that it is later."
6282,"TYRION: But remember, you must tell no one."
6283,LITTLEFINGER: Tell no one what?
6284,TYRION: I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale. Lysa is not fond of me. But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones.
6285,LITTLEFINGER: She imprisoned you. She tried to execute you. And you offer her son a princess?
6286,"TYRION: For men in our position, holding grudges can be an encumbrance, don't you think?"
6287,LITTLEFINGER: And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement?
6288,TYRION: Who better?
6289,NARRATOR:Littlefinger walks as he ponders.
6290,"LITTLEFINGER: Yes, I could sing this song to Lysa, if I cared to. What's in it for me?"
6291,"TYRION: The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war, the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold and Harrenhal."
6292,LITTLEFINGER: Harrenhal is cursed.
6293,"TYRION: Never took you for a superstitious man. By all means, tear it down and rebuild. You'll be able to afford it. I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands."
6294,"LITTLEFINGER: With a single stroke, you'd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm."
6295,TYRION: You served my family well in the matter of the succession.
6296,"LITTLEFINGER: So did Janos Slynt, and he was given Harrenhal, too. Until you snatched it away."
6297,"TYRION: I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn. I didn't need Janos Slynt. It's settled, then?"
6298,LITTLEFINGER: (Nods.)
6299,TYRION: Good. Oh. And remember
6300,LITTLEFINGER: The Queen mustn't know.
6301,NARRATOR:Tyrion drinks deeply and Littlefinger ponders.
6302,CUT TO: STORMLANDS
6303,INT: Renly's chambers at night
6304,"NARRATOR:Renly and Loras are kissing passionately. Renly brings Loras to the bed and sits astride him. He removes his own shirt, kisses him and undoes his shirt. He sees the heavy bruising on Loras's chest."
6305,RENLY: That must hurt.
6306,"NARRATOR:Loras refuses to kiss him, pouting."
6307,RENLY: What? What is it?
6308,LORAS: A member of the Kingsguard? As if I wasn't humiliated enough already.
6309,RENLY: Brienne is a very capable warrior. And she's devoted to me. You're jealous.
6310,LORAS: Jealous? Of Brienne the Beauty? Don't make me laugh.
6311,RENLY: I'll make it up to you.
6312,NARRATOR:Renly moves to remove Loras's pants.
6313,"LORAS: No, Your Grace. Not tonight. There's another Tyrell who requires your attention. You didn't win my father's support or his army on charm alone."
6314,"NARRATOR:Renly lies down, dejected, but then decides to try to seduce Loras one more time. Loras resists."
6315,LORAS: Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back. Brides aren't usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night.
6316,RENLY: And Margaery's a virgin?
6317,LORAS: Officially. Shall I bring her to you?
6318,NARRATOR:LORAS leaves the bed to get his sister.
6319,"INT: Renly's chambers, a bit later."
6320,NARRATOR:Renly pours and drinks some wine. Margaery enters.
6321,"RENLY: I should warn you, I've had quite a bit of wine."
6322,MARGAERY: As is your right. You are a king.
6323,RENLY: You look very beautiful.
6324,"MARGAERY: Thank you, Your Grace."
6325,RENLY: It's a lovely gown.
6326,"MARGAERY: You think so? I can't decide how I like it better. This way, or this way."
6327,"NARRATOR:MARGAERY removes her gown. Renly pauses, embarrassed."
6328,RENLY:  You certainly don't need it.
6329,"NARRATOR:MARGAERY starts kissing RENLY, but he resists and continues talking."
6330,"RENLY: Although, some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed."
6331,"NARRATOR:MARGAERY hushes him and begins kissing again. She reaches to his groin, but is disappointed by his lack of excitement."
6332,RENLY: Must be the wine.
6333,"MARGAERY: Here, let me."
6334,NARRATOR:She undoes his pants and tries to excite him.
6335,RENLY: I'm sorry.
6336,MARGAERY: Do you want my brother to come in and help?
6337,RENLY: What?
6338,MARGAERY: He could get you started. I know he wouldn't mind. Or I can turn over and you can pretend I'm him.
6339,RENLY: I don't know what you're talking about.
6340,MARGAERY: There's no need for us to play games. Save your lies for court. You're going to need a lot of them.
6341,NARRATOR:She sits next to him on the bed.
6342,"MARGAERY: Your enemies aren't happy about us. They want to tear us apart. And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly. We can try again later. You decide how you want to do it, with me, with me and Loras, however else you like. Whatever you need to do. You are a king."
6343,RENLY: (Sighs.)
6344,CUT TO: KING'S LANDING
6345,"INT: Cersei's chambers, at night"
6346,CERSEl: You monster. Myrcella is my only daughter. Do you really think I'll let you sell her like a common whore?
6347,TYRION: Myrcella's a princess. Some would say she was born for this.
6348,CERSEI: I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon.
6349,TYRION: Dorne is the safest place for her.
6350,CERSEI: Are you mad? The Martells loathe us.
6351,TYRION: That's why we need to seduce them. We're going to need their support in the war your son started.
6352,CERSEI: She'll be a hostage.
6353,TYRION: A guest.
6354,"CERSEI: You won't get away with this. You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe. Ned Stark had a piece of paper, too."
6355,"TYRION: It's done, Cersei."
6356,CERSEI:  No.
6357,TYRION:  You cannot stop it.
6358,NARRATOR:CERSEI sweeps glassware from the table in frustration. It shatters.
6359,CERSEI:  No!
6360,"TYRION: Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls? Do you want to see her raped, butchered like the Targaryen children? Make no mistake. They'll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours."
6361,CERSEI: Get out! Get out!
6362,"NARRATOR:She moves to strike Tyrion, who recoils. Cersei turns, sits and weeps. Tyrion exits."
6363,CUT TO: IRON ISLANDS
6364,"INT: Chamber, at night."
6365,NARRATOR:Theon reads over a letter he has written to Robb. He decides to burn it instead.
6366,EXT: By the shore.
6367,NARRATOR:Theon and a drowned priest stand in ankle deep water while soldiers look on.
6368,"PRIEST: Theon of the House Greyjoy, you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God?"
6369,THEON: I would.
6370,DROWNED PRIEST:  Kneel.
6371,NARRATOR:Theon kneels.
6372,"DROWNED PRIEST: Let Theon, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
6373,THEON: What is dead may never die.
6374,DROWNED PRIEST: What is dead may never die. But rises again harder and stronger. Stand.
6375,NARRATOR:Theon stands. Balon and Yara look on.

6377,"INT: Tyrion's chambers, at night"
6378,"NARRATOR:Tyrion sits and ponders. Littlefinger enters, enraged."
6379,"LITTLEFINGER: I don't appreciate being made a fool of, dwarf. If Myrcella marries the Martell boy, she can't very well marry Robin Arryn, can she?"
6380,"TYRION: No, afraid not. Sorry about that."
6381,"LITTLEFINGER: And Harrenhal, I suppose that's off the table as well."
6382,"TYRION: Yes, I fear so. Sorry about that, too."
6383,LITTLEFINGER: Leave me out of your next deception.
6384,TYRION: That's a shame. You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception. My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade. I would see him released. That's where you come in.
6385,LITTLEFINGER: Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.
6386,"TYRION: No, he won't. But his mother might. How would you like to see your beloved Cat again?"
6387,NARRATOR:BRONN enters.
6388,TYRION: Find him?
6389,"BRONN: Oh, aye. And he has company. Filthy old stoat. Almost hate to interrupt."
6390,"TYRION: No, you don't."
6391,"BRONN: No, I don't."
6392,INT: Brothel
6393,"NARRATOR:Pycelle and a prostitute lie on a bed. She is naked, while he is fully clothed. The door bursts open as Bronn and  TIMETT walk in. The woman flees the bed, and Pycelle sits up in indignation."
6394,"PYCELLE: What is the meaning of this? No, please, please."
6395,NARRATOR:TYRION stands in the doorway.
6396,"TYRION: You disappoint me, Grand Maester."
6397,PYCELLE: I am your loyal servant.
6398,TYRION: So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne.
6399,"PYCELLE: No! Never! It's a falsehood. I swear it. It wasn't me. Ah, Varys. It was Varys the Spider."
6400,"TYRION: See, I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys. I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn. I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish. No one but you."
6401,PYCELLE: The eunuch has spies everywhere.
6402,TYRION: Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats.
6403,"PYCELLE: No, no, no."
6404,"TIMETT: There are no goats, halfman."
6405,"TYRION: Well, make do."
6406,NARRATOR:PYCELLE recoils from TIMETT while BRONN smiles.
6407,TYRION: How long have you been spying for my sister?
6408,"PYCELLE: All I did, I did for House Lannister. Always. Your lord father, ask him. I've always been his servant since the days of the Mad King."
6409,TYRION: I don't like his beard.
6410,PYCELLE: What? What?
6411,"NARRATOR:BRONN grabs PYCELLE by the beard, then chops it off with a large knife."
6412,PYCELLE: No. No.
6413,"TYRION: How many Hands have you betrayed, Pycelle? Eddard Stark? Jon Arryn?"
6414,"PYCELLE: Lord Arryn, he knew. He knew the truth about the Queen. And he planned to act, to tell King Robert."
6415,TYRION: So you poisoned him?
6416,PYCELLE: No. Never.
6417,"TYRION: But you let him die, made sure he succumbed."
6418,PYCELLE: Lannister I always served Lannister.
6419,TYRION: Get him out of my sight. Throw him in one of the black cells.
6420,"BRONN and TIMETT wrestle Pycelle out of the room.  Pycelle: No. No, no, no. No, please. Don't! You can't do this to me!"
6421,"NARRATOR:TYRION leaves a coin on the chair for the prostitute, who looks appears to be in shock."
6422,TYRION: For your trouble.
6423,"NARRATOR:The struggle continues, so TYRION decides to double his payment in compensation. The prostitute nods meekly."
6424,INT: TYRION'S CHAMBERS
6425,NARRATOR:Varys and Tyrion sit at table. Varys drinks some wine.
6426,VARYS: You'll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansa's service.
6427,TYRION: Good. One of my better ideas.
6428,"VARYS: And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell? Well played, My Lord Hand. But should I be worried? Janos Slynt, Pycelle. The Small Council grows smaller every day."
6429,TYRION: The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly. I don't mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave.
6430,"VARYS: Power is a curious thing, my lord. Are you fond of riddles?"
6431,"TYRION: Why, am I about to hear one?"
6432,"VARYS: Three great men sit in a room. A king, a priest and a rich man. Between them stands a common sellsword. Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two. Who lives, who dies?"
6433,TYRION: Depends on the sellsword.
6434,VARYS: Does it? He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.
6435,"TYRION: He has a sword, the power of life and death."
6436,"VARYS: But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power? When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible? Joffrey? The executioner? Or something else?"
6437,TYRION: I've decided I don't like riddles.
6438,"VARYS: Power resides where men believe it resides. It's a trick, a shadow on the wall. And a very small man can cast a very large shadow."
6439,NARRATOR:They both drink.
6440,CUT TO: RIVERLANDS
6441,INT: the night's watch recruits sleep. Arya sharpens her sword. Yoren enters.
6442,"YOREN: You should be sleeping. Tomorrow's a long march. Thirty miles, if it don't piss on us."
6443,ARYA: I can't sleep.
6444,NARRATOR:YOREN offers her his wineskin.
6445,ARYA: I don't like the taste.
6446,"YOREN: You don't drink it for the flavor, to be honest. What?"
6447,ARYA: How do you sleep?
6448,"YOREN: Same as most men, I think."
6449,"ARYA: But you've seen things, horrible things."
6450,"YOREN: Aye. I've seen some pretty things, too, but not nearly so many."
6451,ARYA: How do you sleep when you When you have those things in your head?
6452,YOREN: You didn't see that. I made damn sure.
6453,"ARYA: I close my eyes and I see them up there. All of them standing there. Joffrey, the Queen and and my sister."
6454,NARRATOR:YOREN thinks for a bit.
6455,"YOREN: You know, we've got something in common, me and you. You know that? I must have been a couple of years older than you. I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep. He weren't much of a villain what skewered him. Willem, the lad's name was. He ran off before anyone could spit. And I just stood there, watching my brother die. Here's the funny part. I can't picture my brother's face anymore. But Willem, oh, he was a nice-looking boy. He had good white teeth, blue eyes, one of those dimpled chins all the girls like. I would think about him when I was working, when I was drinking, when I was having a shit. It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed. Willem. Willem. Willem. A prayer almost. Well, one day, Willem came riding back into town. I buried an ax so deep into Willem's skull they had to bury him with it. Willem's horse got me to the Wall and I've been wearing black ever since. Well... That'll help you sleep, eh?"
6456,NARRATOR:Horn blasts ring out from outside. Yoren rises quickly in response.
6457,"YOREN: Ho! Get up, you lazy sons of whores! Arm yourselves."
6458,GENDRY: Get up.

6460,"YOREN: Keep out of sight, both of you."
6461,"ARYA:  No, I'm not afraid."
6462,GENDRY: I can fight.
6463,"YOREN: Keep out of sight. If things go wrong, you run. Do you hear me? You run along north and don't look back. Hey, there's men out there who want to fuck your corpses. Outside, now!"
6464,"MAN: Come on, move, move!"
6465,EXT: Gold cloaks ride up to challenge the Night's Watch recruits.

6469,MAN: Open the damn cage!
6470,"AMORY: Where's the bastard, crow?"
6471,YOREN: Got more than a few bastards here. Who's asking?
6472,"AMORY: Ser Amory Lorch, sworn bannerman to Lord Tywin Lannister. These men from the capital requested our assistance. Drop your weapons in the name of the King."
6473,"YOREN: Now, which king would that be?"
6474,"AMORY: This is your last chance. In the name of King Joffrey, drop your weapons."
6475,YOREN: I don't think I will.
6476,AMORY: So be it.
6477,"NARRATOR:A gold cloak shoots Yoren with a crossbow. He falls, but then rises in anger."
6478,YOREN: I always hated crossbows. Take too long to load.
6479,"NARRATOR:YOREN battles the gold cloaks, and takes down a few of them before being subdued. Amory Lorch rides over and pierces Yoren with his sword, killing him. The recruits flee."

6482,NARRATOR:ARYA spies an axe and runs to retrieve it. She comes over to the cage.
6483,"JAQEN: Quick, give it to me. Give me the ax. Give me that."
6484,"NARRATOR:The battle continues. Hot Pie watches from the bushes, but the recruits are outmatched."

6490,NARRATOR:He takes Arya's sword.
6491,ARYA: No!

6498,NARRATOR:They walk back to camp and come across a wounded LOMMY with a crossbow bolt in his leg.
6499,LOMMY: Help! Help me!
6500,"POLLIVER: Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
6501,LOMMY: Look at it.
6502,POLLIVER: Can you walk?
6503,LOMMY: No. You got to carry me.
6504,POLLIVER: All right.
6505,"NARRATOR:He stabs the LOMMY instead. LOMMY spits up blood, and dies."
6506,"POLLIVER: ""Carry him,"" he says."
6507,ARMORY: We're looking for a bastard named Gendry. Give him up or I'll start taking eyeballs.
6508,NARRATOR:No one says anything. Then Arya gets an idea. She nodes over to the slain LOMMY.

6511,NARRATOR:Thunder rumbles through the darkness. It is raining at the gold cloak encampment. Two gold cloaks are arguing over who is the best fighter.
6512,GUARD #1: It's got to be the Mountain. He's the biggest. He's the strongest.
6513,RENNICK: Bulls are bigger than lions. Doesn't mean I'd pick a bull in a fight.
6514,"GUARD #1: If the bull had fangs and claws, I would. Right, the Mountain or our man Jaime."
6515,RENNICK: If he ever gets out.
6516,GUARD #1: Loras Tyrell?
6517,RENNICK: Loras Tyrell. He's prettier than the Queen.
6518,GUARD #1: I don't care about pretty. He's better with a sword than any of them.
6519,"RENNICK: How good could he be? He's been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years, and Renly ain't dead."
6520,"NARRATOR:They laugh, and a horse neighs nervously."
6521,RENNICK: The horses seem a little spooked to you? They're horses.
6522,GUARD #1: They get spooked by their own shadows.
6523,RENNICK: Shh. Do you hear that?
6524,GUARD #1: No.
6525,RENNICK: There's something out there.
6526,"NARRATOR:The soldiers both stand to investigate the darkness. They move forward cautiously, until RENNICK lets out a loud fart. GUARD #1 jumps, and RENNICK laughs raucously."
6527,"GUARD #1: Oh. Oh, you're a right little prick. You should see your face."
6528,"RENNICK: I swear you pissed yourself. ""Oh, who goes there? Ahh!"""

6539,ROOSE: Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours. They're dead. Take everything they've got. We've nowhere to keep all these prisoners. Barely enough food to feed our own.
6540,"ROBB: We're not executing prisoners, Lord Bolton."
6541,"ROOSE: Of course, Your Grace. The officers will be useful. Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannister's plans."
6542,ROBB: I doubt it.
6543,"ROOSE: Well, we'll learn soon enough. In my family, we say, ""A naked man has few secrets. ""A flayed man none."""
6544,ROBB: My father outlawed flaying in the North.
6545,ROOSE: We're not in the North.
6546,ROBB: We're not torturing them.
6547,"ROOSE: The high road's very pretty, but you'll have a hard time marching your army down it."

6554,TALISA: Shh.
6555,"WOUNDED SOLDIER: Please, don't! It'll get better. It doesn't even hurt."

6560,ROBB: You'll die if she doesn't.
6561,"WOUNDED SOLDIER: I don't want to be a cripple, please."
6562,ROOSE: Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub.
6563,"TALISA: Your men are not my men, my lord."
6564,ROBB: Put this in your mouth and lie down. You don't want to watch.
6565,WOUNDED SOLDIER:  No! You can't!

6574,ROBB: You know my family name. You have me at a disadvantage.
6575,TALISA: That boy lost his foot on your orders.
6576,ROBB: They killed my father.
6577,TALISA: That boy did?
6578,ROBB: The family he fights for.
6579,TALISA: Do you think he's friends with King Joffrey? He's a fisherman's son that grew up near Lannisport. He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago.
6580,ROBB: I have no hatred for the lad.
6581,TALISA: That should help his foot grow back.
6582,"NARRATOR:TALISA walks away in frustration, carrying a heavy pail. ROBB follows."
6583,"ROBB: You'd have us surrender, end all this bloodshed. I understand. The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey."
6584,TALISA: You're going to kill Joffrey?
6585,ROBB: If the gods give me strength.
6586,TALISA: And then what?
6587,ROBB:  I don't know. We'll go back to Winterfell. I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne.
6588,TALISA: So who will?
6589,ROBB:  I don't know.
6590,"TALISA: You're fighting to overthrow a king, and yet you have no plan for what comes after?"
6591,ROBB: First we have to win the war.
6592,"NARRATOR:Frustrated, TALISA climbs onto a horse's cart, and signals it to start off."
6593,ROBB: You never told me where you're from.
6594,TALISA: Volantis.
6595,ROBB:  Volantis? You're far from home. The boy was lucky you were here.

6604,"NARRATOR:LANCEL address the room, which is taken aback by his recounting."
6605,"LANCEL: Using some vile sorcery, your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves. Thousands of good men were butchered. After the slaughter, the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain."
6606,JOFFREY: Killing you would send your brother a message.
6607,SANSA: (Cries.)
6608,JOFFREY: But my mother insists on keeping you alive. Stand. So we'll have to send your brother a message some other way. Meryn.

6620,"BRONN: Careful, now. We don't want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak."
6621,TYRION: Someone get the girl something to cover herself with. She is to be your queen. Have you no regard for her honor?
6622,JOFFREY: I'm punishing her.
6623,"TYRION: For what crimes? She did not fight her brother's battle, you half-wit."
6624,JOFFREY: You can't talk to me like that. The king can do as he likes!
6625,TYRION: The Mad King did as he liked. Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him?
6626,MERYN: No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard.
6627,"TYRION: I'm not threatening the king, ser. I am educating my nephew. Bronn, the next time Ser Meryn speaks, kill him. That was a threat. See the difference?"
6628,NARRATOR:MERYN stares daggers at TYRION. TYRION approaches SANSA and offers his hand. She takes it and stands. They walk out together.
6629,TYRION: I apologize for my nephew's behavior. Tell me the truth. Do you want an end to this engagement?
6630,"SANSA: I am loyal to King Joffrey, my one true love."
6631,"TYRION: Lady Stark, you may survive us yet."
6632,"NARRATOR:TYRION watches SANSA walk out of the chamber, in admiration of her strength and clever response."
6633,BRONN: The little king's backed up. Clogged from balls to brains.
6634,TYRION: You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him?
6635,BRONN: There's no cure for being a cunt. But the boy's at that age. And he's got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies. Couldn't hurt to get some of the poison out.

6659,JOFFREY: Harder.
6660,"NARRATOR:DAISY looks worried. ROS hits her with more force, and she cries in pain. DAISY seems disgusted with herself. JOFFREY grabs her chin, roughly."
6661,JOFFREY: I said harder. He'd want me to get his money's worth.
6662,"NARRATOR:ROS nods meekly. JOFFREY steps away. The spanking begins agian, harder than before. DAISY screams in pain. After multiple spankings, DAISY scrambles onto the bed, crying. Joffrey presents a mace to DAISY, who takes it."

6675,LITTLEFINGER: Your Grace.
6676,"RENLY: Now you do the Lannisters' bidding, is that it? Tell me, was my brother's body even cold before you secured your newest patron?"
6677,LITTLEFINGER: I'm a practical man.
6678,RENLY: Just not a loyal one.
6679,LITTLEFINGER: And who would you have me be loyal to? Your brother's corpse?
6680,"RENLY: I don't like you, Lord Baelish. I don't like your face. I don't like the words that come oozing out of your mouth. I don't want you in my tent one minute more than necessary. So tell me, why are you here?"
6681,NARRATOR:LITTLEFINGER's eyes shift to BRIENNE.
6682,RENLY: You can trust Brienne. Her loyalty comes without charge.
6683,"LITTLEFINGER: You still have many friends at court, Your Grace, many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim."
6684,NARRATOR:RENLY takes an apple and sits down.
6685,"RENLY: Now I understand. You know I have the numbers. You know I'm marching on King's Landing. When I take the throne, you hope to retain your position. And your head."
6686,LITTLEFINGER: I would give priority to my head.
6687,RENLY: (snorts)
6688,"LITTLEFINGER: I understand that you don't like me, and while that saddens me greatly, I did not come here today seeking your affection. When you march on King's Landing, you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates."

6693,MARGAERY: Lord Baelish.
6694,LITTLEFINGER: All of these tents look the same to me. -Would you be so kind
6695,"MARGAERY: It would be my pleasure. It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp. Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress. And the moment I learn which tent is mine, we're on the move again."
6696,"LITTLEFINGER: ""Your tent""? Not ""Our tent""? The king snores, perhaps? Or simply prefers solitude? Pressures of command, no doubt. Four kings vying for the throne."
6697,"MARGAERY: I am not tutored in warfare, but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers."
6698,"LITTLEFINGER: If war were arithmetic, the mathematicians would rule the world. I did notice your brother entering His Grace's tent just now."
6699,MARGAERY: The place of a Kingsguard is by the king's side.
6700,"LITTLEFINGER: And on the night of your wedding, who was by the king's side then?"
6701,MARGAERY: You seem quite interested in our marriage.
6702,"LITTLEFINGER: Your marriage is quite interesting. Not only to me, but to the realm. The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest, if nothing else."
6703,"MARGAERY: You've never married, have you?"
6704,"LITTLEFINGER: I've been unlucky in my affections, sadly."
6705,"MARGAERY: That is sad. Though perhaps it's for the best. The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you, so allow me to explain. My husband is my king, and my king is my husband. Here is your tent, Lord Baelish. Good night."

6841,"STANNIS: For the sake of the mother who bore us, I will give you this one night to reconsider. Strike your banners, come to me before dawn, and I will grant you your old seat in the Council. I'll even name you my heir until a son is born to me. Otherwise I shall destroy you."
6842,NARRATOR:RENLY quickly considers the offer.
6843,"RENLY: Look across those fields, brother. Can you see all those banners?"
6844,STANNIS: You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king?
6845,RENLY: No. The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king.
6846,"STANNIS: We shall see, Renly. Come the dawn, we shall see."
6847,"MELISANDRE: Look to your sins, Lord Renly. The night is dark and full of terrors."

6851,NARRATOR:EXT. THE GATES OF QARTH
6852,NARRATOR:DAENERYS and her Dothraki sit outside the gates of Qarth. The gates are closed.
6853,DAENERYS: I thought we were welcome.
6854,"JORAH: If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city, you might do the same, Khaleesi."
6855,DAENERYS: Horde?
6856,"NARRATOR:QARTH soldiers line up outside the gate, at attention. A group of thirteen emissaries from the city walk forward from the gates. A plump SPICE KING leads the group."
6857,DAENERYS: My name is Daenerys
6858,SPICE KING: Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen.
6859,"DAENERYS: You know me, my lord?"
6860,"SPICE KING: Only by reputation, Khaleesi. And I'm no lord, merely a humble merchant. They call you the Mother of Dragons."
6861,DAENERYS: And what should I call you?
6862,"SPICE KING: Oh, my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce. I am simply a trader of spices. But we are the Thirteen, charged with the governance and protection of Qarth, the greatest city that ever was or will be."
6863,DAENERYS:  The beauty of Quarth is legendary
6864,NARRATOR:SPICE KING Qarth.
6865,DAENERYS:  Qarth.
6866,SPICE KING: Might we see the dragons?
6867,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks back to the woven chest that holds the dragons on top of one of their horses. She is nervous, and a bit desperate."
6868,"DAENERYS: My friend, we have traveled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed, I would be honored"
6869,"SPICE KING: Forgive me, Mother of Dragons, but no man alive has seen a living dragon. Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist. All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves."
6870,DAENERYS:  I am not a liar.
6871,"SPICE KING: Oh, I don't think you are. But as I've never met you before, my opinion on the matter is of limited value."
6872,"DAENERYS: Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates."
6873,SPICE KING: Then perhaps you should return to where you come from. We wish you well.
6874,"NARRATOR:The SPICE KING turns and walks away. DAENERYS steps follows with indignation, and he turns back around."
6875,DAENERYS: What are you doing? You promised to receive me.
6876,"SPICE KING: We have received you. Here we are, and here you are."
6877,"DAENERYS:  If you do not let us in, all of us will die."
6878,SPICE KING: Which we shall deeply regret. But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates.
6879,"NARRATOR:The SPICE KING continues to the thirteen, and they begin their walk back into Qarth."
6880,"JORAH: Khaleesi, please be careful."
6881,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS finds her resolve and steps forward. The soldiers react by leaning their spears forward in unison, clearly a warning."
6882,"DAENERYS: Thirteen! When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me. We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground. Turn us away and we will burn you first."
6883,NARRATOR:The SPICE KING steps forward from the thirteen.
6884,"SPICE KING:  Ah. You are a true Targaryen. Only, as you said a moment ago, if we don't let you into the city, you will all die. And so"
6885,NARRATOR:XARO XHOAN DAXOS steps out from the back of the Thirteen.
6886,XARO: Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be.
6887,"SPICE KING: The discussion is over, Xaro Xhoan Daxos. The Thirteen have spoken."
6888,"XARO: I am one of the Thirteen, and I am still speaking."
6889,SPICE KING:  The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine?  She is the Mother of Dragons.
6890,"XARO: Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire? I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city. After all, here I am, a savage from the Summer Isles, and Qarth still stands."
6891,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS recognizes that XARO is a potential ally, but the SPICE KING remains resolute."
6892,SPICE KING:  Our decision is final.
6893,XARO: Very well. I invoke soumai.
6894,"NARRATOR:The Thirteen react, looking between themselves. XARO draws his dagger, pointing downward and grabs the blade with his left hand. DAENERYS looks to JORAH for council."
6895,"XARO: I will vouch for her, her people, and her dragons, in accordance with the law."
6896,"NARRATOR:XARO pulls the dagger up, slicing his palm deeply. He displays the wound to the Thirteen."
6897,SPICE KING: Be it on your head.
6898,"XARO: Welcome to Qarth, my lady."
6899,"NARRATOR:The SPICE KING rejoins the Thirteen in frustration. XARO gestures a welcome to DAENERYS, and the gates open, noisily. DAENERYS and JORAH share a glance before the Dothraki band walk through the city gates. XARO joins her side."

6916,"MOUNTAIN: We weren't expecting you till tomorrow, Lord Tywin."
6917,TYWIN: Evidently not. Why are these prisoners not in their cells?
6918,"MOUNTAIN: Cells are overflowing, my lord."
6919,"POLLIVER: This lot won't be here long. Don't need no permanent place. After we interrogate 'em, we usually just"
6920,TYWIN: Are we so well-manned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers?
6921,"NARRATOR:He gets no response. TYWIN continues to inspect the prisoners, and addresses GENDRY."

6924,"GENDRY: Smith, my lord."

6926,"POLLIVER: What are you looking at? Kneel! Kneel or I'll carve your lungs out, boy."
6927,"NARRATOR:ARYA backs away, and TYWIN intervenes."
6928,"TYWIN: He'll do no such thing. This one's a girl, you idiot, dressed as a boy. Why?"
6929,"ARYA: Safer to travel, my lord."

6937,"NARRATOR:LANCEL extends a scroll to TYRION, who takes it, unimpressed."
6938,TYRION:  So it is. Will you take a cup with me? I find that mulled wine helps me sleep.
6939,NARRATOR:TYRION steps into his chamber and pours himself a cup of wine.
6940,"LANCEL: I am here at Her Grace's behest, not to drink with you, Imp."
6941,"TYRION: If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle, I would have thought she'd come herself."
6942,NARRATOR:Instead she sends you. What am I to make of that?
6943,"LANCEL: I don't care what you make of it, so long as you release your prisoner immediately."
6944,"NARRATOR:LANCEL moves to leave, but TYRION does not let him."
6945,TYRION: And you've received these instructions directly from Cersei?
6946,LANCEL: As I said several times.
6947,TYRION: And you've waited this long to deliver the information?
6948,"LANCEL: When the Queen Regent gives me a command, I carry it out without delay."
6949,"NARRATOR:TYRION ponders the scroll, while LANCEL stands over his desk, annoyed."
6950,"TYRION: Cersei must have great trust in you, allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf."
6951,NARRATOR:LANCEL thinks carefully before responding.
6952,LANCEL: The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities. She often works from dusk till dawn.
6953,TYRION: She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn.
6954,"NARRATOR:As TYRION walks past LANCEL, he catches a familiar aroma."
6955,"TYRION:  Ah. Lavender oil. She always loved lavender oil, even as a girl."
6956,LANCEL: I am a knight!
6957,"TYRION: An anointed knight, yes. Tell me, did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed? What? Nothing to say? No more warnings for me, ser?"
6958,LANCEL: You will withdraw these filthy accusations.
6959,TYRION: Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out you've been bedding his mother?
6960,"NARRATOR:LANCEL sits, and chokes out some frustration."
6961,LANCEL: It's not my fault!
6962,"TYRION: Did she take you against your will? Can you not defend yourself, knight?"
6963,"LANCEL: Your own father, Lord Tywin, when I was named the King's squire, he told me to obey her in everything."
6964,"TYRION: Did he tell you to fuck her, too?"
6965,LANCEL: I only meant I did as I was bid.
6966,"TYRION: Hated every moment of it, is that what you'll have me believe? A high place in court, a knighthood, my sister's legs spreading open for you at night. Oh, yes, it must have been terrible. Wait here. His Grace will want to hear this."
6967,NARRATOR:TYRION moves to leave the chamber to fetch JOFFREY. LANCEL falls to his knees and begs.
6968,"LANCEL: Mercy! Mercy, my lord! I beg you."
6969,TYRION:  Save it for Joffrey. He loves a good grovel.
6970,"LANCEL: My lord, it was your sister's bidding, the Queen. I'll leave the city at once, I swear."
6971,"TYRION: No, I think not."
6972,LANCEL: My lord?
6973,"TYRION: You heard me. My father told you to obey my sister. Obey her. Stay close to her side. Keep her trust. Pleasure her whenever she requires. No one ever need know, as long as you keep faith with me. I want to know what Cersei is doing, where she goes, who she sees, what they talk of, everything. And you will tell me."
6974,"LANCEL: Yes, my lord, I will. I swear it, as you command."
6975,NARRATOR:TYRION claps in celebration.
6976,"TYRION: Oh, rise, rise. Let us drink to our understanding. Oh, you don't have a cup. Oh, well. Smile, cousin. My sister is a beautiful woman, and it's all for the good of the realm. Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness, that I want no more conflict between us and that, henceforth, I shall do nothing without her consent."
6977,LANCEL: But her demands?
6978,"TYRION: Oh, I'll give her Pycelle."
6979,LANCEL: You will?
6980,"TYRION: Yes, I'll release him in the morning. Cersei can keep him as a pet, if she wants, but I will not have him on the Council. I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head, but that would not, strictly speaking, be true. Stay within one table length."

6986,"DAVOS: Well, life's been good since you hacked them off, Your Grace. And it's four less fingernails to clean."
6987,STANNIS: Fewer.
6988,DAVOS: Pardon?
6989,STANNIS: Four fewer fingernails to clean. Never understood why you had to wear them.
6990,DAVOS: It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now. It reminds me of your justice. It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver.
6991,"STANNIS: You were a hero and a smuggler. A good act does not wash out the bad, nor a bad the good."
6992,DAVOS: A lesson I've tried to teach my son.
6993,STANNIS: Does he listen?
6994,"DAVOS: To me? Gods, no. But if your red woman told him to leap from the crow's nest"
6995,STANNIS: She has a name. I trust you've not forgotten your smuggler's tricks.
6996,DAVOS: I've lived within the law for 17
6997,STANNIS: I want you to be a smuggler this time.
6998,"DAVOS: Any shore, any night. What am I bringing ashore?"
6999,STANNIS: The red woman. No one must know what you do and we'll not speak of this again.

7007,"MELISANDRE:  You've carried more unpleasant cargo in your time. Are you a good man, Ser Davos Seaworth?"
7008,"DAVOS: I'd say my parts are mixed, my lady, good and bad."
7009,"MELISANDRE:  If half an onion is black with rot, it's a rotten onion. A man is good or he is evil."
7010,DAVOS: And which are you?
7011,"MELISANDRE: Oh, good. I'm a knight myself, of sorts, a champion of light and life."
7012,"DAVOS: Well, that must be very nice for you."
7013,NARRATOR:DAVOS stows the oars and enters the water to lead the boat to shore. He pulls it onto the shore.

7026,"MELISANDRE: Shadows cannot live in the dark, Ser Davos. They are servants of light, the children of fire. And the brighter the flame, the darker they are."
7027,NARRATOR:DAVOS holds up the lantern to bars that obstruct their way.
7028,DAVOS: These weren't here before. They've barred the passage.
7029,MELISANDRE: They can't bar our passage.

7033,"NARRATOR:The lantern flares suddenly, surprising DAVOS, who retreats. MELISANDRE sits down behind him, and assumes a birthing position. She moans in pain as she gives birth.

The second soldiers falls soon after, with BRIENNE plunging her sword down his spine. CATELYN stares while BRIENNE looks upon RENLY's corpse. She staggers and falls to her knees, sobbing over his lifeless body. CATELYN comes beside her to comfort her."

7107,"CERSEI: Whomever did it, I say well done."
7108,"TYRION: It's not what Varys says. He says Renly's army is flocking to support Stannis, which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea."

7120,TYRION: May I ask specifically what the king has in mind?
7121,"CERSEI: You may, specifically, or you may ask vaguely. The answer will be the same."
7122,TYRION: It's important that we talk about this.
7123,CERSEI: It's the king's royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors.

7127,LANCEL: It's wildfire.
7128,"TYRION: Wildfire? You wouldn't lie to me, would you, cousin?"
7129,LANCEL: No.
7130,TYRION:That's a lie right there.
7131,LANCEL: It is not a lie. Why would I lie?
7132,"TYRION: Tell me, if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true, do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely? When I tell him you're fucking her, I mean."
7133,LANCEL: I'm telling you the truth.
7134,TYRION: The smart money would be on more likely.
7135,LANCEL: She's making wildfire.
7136,TYRION: But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours.
7137,LANCEL: The Alchemists' Guild is being commissioned.
7138,TYRION: I suppose there's only one way to find out.
7139,LANCEL: They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults. They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis' ships and armies. Please.
7140,TYRION: When did she tell you this?
7141,"LANCEL: I heard her talking with the pyromancer And the other night, after I left her, she went to meet him. I swear to you."
7142,TYRION: Swear to me on what?
7143,LANCEL: On my life.
7144,TYRION: But I don't care about your life.
7145,"LANCEL: In the light of the Seven, by all that is holy and right, I, Lancel Lannister, do solemnly vow . . ."
7146,"TYRION: All right, all right. Enough. Even torturing you is boring. Just get out."
7147,"NARRATOR:TYRION pushes LANCEL out of the small tent. LANCEL falls to the ground, grunting."

7155,STANNIS: What is it?
7156,"DAVOS: I'm sorry about your brother, Your Grace, I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him."
7157,"STANNIS: Fools love a fool. I grieve for him as well, for the boy he was, not the man he grew to be."
7158,STANNIS: I thought I made it clear to you there'd be no need to speak to me on this matter.
7159,"DAVOS: Your Grace, I --"
7160,STANNIS: I've never known you to need to hear a thing twice.

7163,STANNIS: You've come to lecture me on truth?
7164,DAVOS: I've come to tell you that what I saw.
7165,"STANNIS: All my brother's bannermen have come to my side. Except the Tyrells, who fled like cowards. They won't be able to resist us now. Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne."

7170,DAVOS: When do we sail for King's Landing?
7171,"STANNIS: As soon as I've consolidated my troops. We'll make short work of the Lannisters' fleet. Once Blackwater Bay is cleared, we'll deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city."
7172,DAVOS: And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you?
7173,STANNIS: That's not your concern.
7174,"DAVOS: If you take King's Landing with her by your side, the victory will be hers."
7175,STANNIS: I never thought I'd have reason to doubt your loyalty. Was I wrong?
7176,DAVOS: Loyal service means telling hard truths.
7177,"STANNIS: Oh, truth again. All right, what's the truth? The hard truth?"
7178,DAVOS: She's a foreigner preaching her foreign religion. Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey.
7179,STANNIS: What do you believe?
7180,DAVOS: You won those bannermen from Renly. Don't lose them to her.
7181,STANNIS: We set out for King's Landing without Lady Melisandre. And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay.
7182,"DAVOS: Your Grace, I'm honored, but my time on the sea was spent evading ships, not attacking them. The other lords won't be happy."
7183,"STANNIS: Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I don't hang them for treason. Hard truths cut both ways, Ser Davos."

7193,"TYRION: Well, I've never actually been able to kill people with it."
7194,BRONN: Good thing. I'd be out of a job. What about your father?
7195,"TYRION: He hasn't sent a raven in weeks. He's very busy. Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is time-consuming. We won't be able to hold the city against Stannis, not the way Joffrey's planning on holding it."

7197,PROTESTER: Corruption.

7205,BRONN: He's talking about you.
7206,TYRION: What? Demon monkey?
7207,BRONN: People think you're pulling the king's strings. They blame you for the city's ills.

Don't reckon I've got much use for a captain at all. I'm thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself. All I need is a ship. You wouldn't know where I could find myself a ship now, would you?"
7223,NARRATOR:BLACK LORREN walks away down the steps to the dock.

7232,THEON: You'd better get out there. Wouldn't want her to set sail without you.

7238,THEON: Why aren't you with the rest of them? Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea? That would be good for a laugh.
7239,DAGMER: They're not gonna respect you until you prove yourself.
7240,THEON: And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging piss-poor fishing villages?
7241,DAGMER: You're not.
7242,THEON: And yet that's the task my father has given me to prove that I'm a true Iron Islander.
7243,DAGMER: They're all Iron Islanders. Do they do as they're told or do they do as they like?
7244,"NARRATOR:THEON follows DAGMER onto a dock, where he attends to a boat."
7245,THEON: The Stony Shore's not far from Torrhen's Square.
7246,"THEON:  No, we could. We could never hold it for more than a few days. As soon as Winterfell got word that we'd taken Torrhen's Square, the Starks would send their men to take it back. And then"

7253,TYWIN: The Starks understand winter better than we ever will. The cold won't beat them.
7254,AMORY: Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords. They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn.
7255,"TYWIN: And I'm sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments, they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords. This is war, no one's content. We've underestimated the Stark boy for too long. He has a good mind for warfare, his men worship him. And as long as he keeps winning battles, they'll keep believing he is King in the North. You've been waiting for him to fail. He is not going to fail, not without our help. So how do we stop him?"
7256,"REGINALD: We've worked through the night, my lord. Perhaps we'd profit from some sleep."
7257,"TYWIN: Yes, I think you would, Reginald. And because you're my cousin, I might even let you wake from that sleep. Go, I'm sure your wife must miss you."
7258,REGINALD: My wife's in Lannisport.

7272,"ARYA: Barrowton, my lord. House Dustin. Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown."
7273,TYWIN: And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North?
7274,ARYA: They call him the Young Wolf.
7275,TYWIN: And?
7276,ARYA: They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf. They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants. They say he can't be killed.

7284,JAQEN: A girl says nothing.
7285,ARYA: (gasps)
7286,"JAQEN: A girl keeps her mouth closed. No one hears, and friends may talk in secret, yes? A boy becomes a girl."
7287,ARYA: I was always a girl.
7288,JAQEN: And I was always aware. But the girl keeps secrets. It is not for a man to spoil them.
7289,ARYA: You're one of them now. I should have let you burn.

Speak three names and the man will do the rest. Three lives I will give you, no more, no less, and we're done."
7298,ARYA: I can name anyone and you'll kill him?

7311,JEOR: Most of them are true.

7313,JEOR: The whole winter. He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came. Had to wait for the thaw.
7314,JON: So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own.

7322,"EDDISON TOLLETT: Before I die, please, stop talking."
7323,"SAM: Thousands and thousands of years ago, the First Men stood here where we're standing all through the long night. What do you think they were like, the First Men?"
7324,EDDISON TOLLETT: Stupid. Smart people don't find themselves in places like this.
7325,GRENN: (laughs)

7331,"SAM: And three for White Walkers. It's been a thousand years, but that's the only time they blow the horn three times."

7348,BRONN: If I could tell you how many crazy old men I've seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit. No offense meant.
7349,HAYLENE: Our order does not deal in pig shit. The substance is fire given form. And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.
7350,BRONN: To do what?
7351,HAYLENE: The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.

7355,"HAYLENE: My lord, this man is insulting."
7356,"BRONN: I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy. 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us. Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down."
7357,TYRION: My friend remains unconvinced.
7358,HAYLENE: He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived.
7359,"BRONN: Well, he's not living anymore. And all his pots of wildfire didn't help him, did they? Men win wars, not magic tricks."
7360,NARRATOR:HAYLENE forces open an ancient door. They enter a storeroom. TYRION is amazed at how much wildfire they have produced.
7361,"HAYLENE: We have been working tirelessly, day and night, ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so. Our present count stands at 7,811. Enough to burn Stannis Baratheon's fleet and armies both."
7362,BRONN: This is a shit idea.
7363,"TYRION: I'm afraid I have to concur with my advisor, Wisdom Haylene. The contents of this room could lay King's Landing low. You won't be making wildfire for my sister any longer. You'll be making it for me."

Sneak in, kill Mance, and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall. And to do that"

7525,XARO: Unlikely. I can almost always tell what a man wants.
7526,DAENERYS: And what about what a woman wants?
7527,"XARO: Much more complicated. You, for example, what do you want?"
7528,DAENERYS: To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne.
7529,XARO: Why?
7530,DAENERYS: Because I promised my khalasar I'd protect them and find them a safe home.
7531,XARO: You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki?
7532,DAENERYS: I want them because they're mine by right. The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it.

7534,DAENERYS:  And how did you get all of this? Did someone give it to you?
7535,"XARO: No. I come from nothing. I hit the docks like a piece of cargo, except someone normally cares what happens to cargo."

I made the same offer to the greatest thieves. They all went home empty-handed. The only thing that can open this door is this key.

7549,XARO: Is marry me.

7561,JORAH: According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand?
7562,DAENERYS: The time to strike is now. We need to find ships and an army or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.
7563,"JORAH: Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get. They'll give you ships and soldiers and they'll own you forever. Moving carefully is the hard way, but it's the right way."

You would not only be respected and feared, you would be loved. Someone who can rule and should rule. Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world. There are times when I look at you and I still can't believe you're real."

7707,QHORIN: I said you can't. They find a nice cave to hide in while the sun's up and do their killing when it's dark.
7708,JON: We could do the same.
7709,"QHORIN: No, we couldn't. This is their country. They know where to walk, where not to walk. I've lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didn't see till they were in it."
7710,JON: My father always said I'm of the North.
7711,QHORIN: (laughs)
7712,JON: I wasn't joking.
7713,"QHORIN: Look around, boy. This look like home to you? You start thinking you know this place, it will kill you. You understand me?"
7714,JON: (nods)
7715,"QHORIN: No, you don't. We're at war. We've always been at war. It's never going to end 'cause we're not fighting an enemy. We're fighting the North, and it's not going anywhere. The Watch has given you a great gift. You only have one thing to give in return, your life."
7716,JON:  I'll gladly give my life.
7717,"QHORIN: I don't want you to be glad about it. I want you to curse and fight until your heart's done pumping. And know this, boy. Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall. They'll never know what you've done. They'll never know how you died. They won't even know your damn name. But they'll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs. Now, do you understand me?"
7718,JON: I do.
7719,"QHORIN: You're even dumber than you look. It's just words, boy, to keep us a little warmer in the night. Make us feel like we've got a purpose. Come on. We've got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us."
7720,NARRATOR:Ghost walks behind the men. JON moves to catch up.

7722,NARRATOR:TYWIN meets with his war council. ARYA comes in to serve wine.
7723,TYWIN: Can you read?
7724,AMORY: My lord?
7725,TYWIN: Can you read?
7726,NARRATOR:AMORY stares blankly.
7727,TYWIN: This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand. It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand.
7728,"AMORY: My apologies, my lord. I must have"
7729,"TYWIN: Girl, fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses. It's the one on this"
7730,NARRATOR:ARYA picks up the correct volume right away and brings it to the table. TYWIN chuckes and stands.
7731,TYWIN: My cupbearer can read better than you.
7732,NARRATOR:TYWIN opens the book
7733,TYWIN: To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance?
7734,"ARMORY: My lord, I"
7735,"TYWIN: To the Starks of Winterfell! Who have 20,000 men and my son! I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants. I see I overestimated you. If you ever put my son's life at risk again, I'll Leave us."
7736,"NARRATOR:AMORY stands, and leaves."
7737,"TYWIN: Put the book away, girl. Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while you're about it."
7738,NARRATOR:There is a knock on the door and a kings guard enters.
7739,GUARD: Lord Petyr Baelish.
7740,TYWIN: Mmm. Give us the room.
7741,NARRATOR:The war councils leaves.
7742,TYWIN: (to Arya) Clear all this.
7743,NARRATOR:LITTLEFINGER enters.
7744,LITTLEFINGER: Lord Tywin.
7745,TYWIN: (not amused) Baelish.
7746,NARRATOR:ARYA continues to clear the table.
7747,TYWIN:  Wine?
7748,LITTLEFINGER: Thank you.
7749,"NARRATOR:They sit at the table. ARYA takes a deep breath, for she does not want LITTLEFINGER to recognize her, while she must also attend to TYWIN without raising his suspicions."
7750,TYWIN: What news from the capital?
7751,LITTLEFINGER: I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheon's camp.
7752,"TYWIN: Ah, the late King Renly. Rather a short reign. Murdered by a woman, I hear."
7753,LITTLEFINGER: So they say. There has been talk of other forces at work. Dark forces.
7754,"NARRATOR:ARYA serves wine to LITTLEFINGER, who raises his glass to his lips. ARYA tries to walk away from the table, but TYWIN stops her, and hands her more to clear."
7755,TYWIN: Here. Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel.
7756,LITTLEFINGER: It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after.
7757,"TYWIN: You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it. Yes, a crisis is an opportunity. What other brilliant insights have you brought me today?"
7758,"TYWIN:  Yes, yes, yes."
7759,LITTLEFINGER: The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings. Loras wants revenge. He blames Stannis for Renly's death. And Margaery
7760,TYWIN: Wants to be queen.
7761,"LITTLEFINGER: Yes, she does."
7762,TYWIN: House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne. Against my grandson.
7763,"LITTLEFINGER: They did. And perhaps that treason should be punished one day, after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated."
7764,TYWIN: (to Arya) More wine for Lord Baelish.
7765,NARRATOR:ARYA continues to move so that LITTLEFINGER cannot see her face clearly.
7766,"LITTLEFINGER: If you will allow me to represent your family's interests, I believe that an advantageous agreement TYWIN: The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden?"
7767,LITTLEFINGER: They have.
7768,"NARRATOR:ARYA spills some wine, and tries to mop it up in a panic."
7769,"ARYA: Pardon, my lord."
7770,LITTLEFINGER:  It's only wine.
7771,"NARRATOR:LITTLEFINGER tries to look at ARYA's face, but TYWIN pulls his attention away."
7772,TYWIN: You would ride there yourself?
7773,"LITTLEFINGER: Tonight, with your leave."
7774,"TYWIN:  I'll have an answer by nightfall. That'll be all, girl."
7775,"NARRATOR:ARYA steps away from the table, but continues to listen as she walks away."
7776,TYWIN: And what else?
7777,"LITTLEFINGER: On your son Tyrion's directive, I met with Catelyn Stark."
7778,TYWIN: Why?
7779,LITTLEFINGER: He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters.
7780,TYWIN: Hmm.
7781,EXT: NORTH OF THE WALL.
7782,"NARRATOR:JON, QHORIN and the party of Night's Watchmen creep among rocks and snow of a mountaintop, stalking a wildling camp by a fire. The wildlings, tending to their duties. QHORIN signals and one of the Night's Watchmen lets loose an arrow, striking a wildling in the chest. A short skirmish ensues. JON grapples a hooded wildling into submission, after preventing her from grabbing a weapon. Her hood falls away to reveal YGRITTE, panting. JON is shocked."
7783,JON: A girl.
7784,QHORIN: A wildling.
7785,JON: We could question her.
7786,QHORIN: You could. She won't answer. I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.
7787,JON: What's your name?
7788,YGRITTE: Ygritte.
7789,NARRATOR:QHORIN picks up the axe that YGRITTE was reaching for.
7790,"QHORIN: She was reaching for this ax when you got to her. Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face."
7791,NARRATOR:QHORIN throws the axe down to emphasize his point.
7792,YGRITTE: I gave you my name.
7793,JON: I'm Jon Snow.
7794,NARRATOR:JON stands back but keeps his blade trained on YGRITTE's face. She looks at the fallen wildlings.
7795,YGRITTE: You ought to burn them you killed.
7796,"QHORIN:  We'd need a big fire for that. Tell me, Ygritte. Why do you want us to build a big fire? Are there some more friends in the area?"
7797,YGRITTE: Burn them or maybe you'll need those swords again.
7798,QHORIN: Our boy here's already killed one dead man. He can do it again if he has to. What waits beyond the pass?
7799,YGRITTE: The free folk.
7800,QHORIN:  How many?
7801,"YGRITTE:  Hundreds and thousands. More than you've ever seen, crow."
7802,QHORIN: Why come to the mountains? What's in the Frostfangs your king could want?
7803,NARRATOR:YGRITTE doesn't answer. She locks eyes with JON.
7804,QHORIN: Do you mean to march on the Wall?
7805,NARRATOR:QHORIN leans down closely and places his hand on YGRITTE's face.
7806,"QHORIN: Do you know who I am, girl?"
7807,YGRITTE: Qhorin Halfhand.
7808,"QHORIN:  Tell me true. If your people captured me, would they take me prisoner?"
7809,"YGRITTE: They'd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind. If not, they'd kill you slow."
7810,NARRATOR:QHORIN nods and stands back.
7811,QHORIN: We have no food for her. Can't spare a man to watch her. Can't let her go. She'll bring Mance Rayder's army down on us. It needs to be done. Want me to do it?
7812,NARRATOR:QHORIN draws his sword.
7813,"JON: No. No, I'll do it."
7814,"QHORIN: Come, brothers. We'll leave him to it. We'll meet you at the top. Don't take too long. We're deep in their country now."
7815,"NARRATOR:QHORIN and the watchmen exit. JON points his sword at YGRITTE's face, who still lays still on the rocks. He hesitates."
7816,"YGRITTE: You never killed a woman before, did you? You don't need to do it. Mance would take you. I know he would. There's secret ways. The crows would never catch us."
7817,NARRATOR:JON pushed the point of his sword into her chin to quiet her.
7818,JON: I'm as much a crow as they are.
7819,"NARRATOR:YGRITTE rolls onto her stomach, accepting her fate. JON positions his sword above the back of her neck."
7820,YGRITTE: Will you burn me? After?
7821,JON: Can't. Someone might see the smoke.
7822,NARRATOR:YGRITTE pulls her hood back in frustration. She wants a clean death. JON rests the sword on the back of her neck.
7823,"YGRITTE:  Strike hard and true, Jon Snow, or I'll come back and haunt you. That's cold."
7824,NARRATOR:JON continues to hesistate. Go on. Be quick about it.
7825,NARRATOR:JON pulls the sword away. YGRITTE looks at him in frustration.
7826,"YGRITTE:  Do it. Bastard, do it!"
7827,"NARRATOR:JON brings his sword over his head, and strikes downward, hitting the rock in front of YGRITTE's head. She looks at the blade before her face, and realizes that JON cannot bring himself to kill her. They look at one another and she seizes her chance. She slams a rock into JON's knee, and he falls. She runs, putting her hood back on. JON pursues her as she runs down the mountainside. Both are desperate. JON can't seem to catch up, but he spies an opportunity to shortcut the fleeing YGRITTE. He takes another route, and slides down a hill to tackle YGRITTE. He drops his sword in the process, but pulls out a knife, and places at her throat."
7828,YGRITTE:  You can't do it. We both know it.
7829,"NARRATOR:JON turns her over, and stands above her."
7830,"YGRITTE: The sun's going down, Jon Snow. And your friends are nowhere close."

7940,DAENERYS: I already have a husband.
7941,"XARO: Khal Drogo is gone, Khaleesi. You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful."
7942,DAENERYS: And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery.
7943,"XARO: I have traveled very far in my life and met many women, but none that are immune to flattery."

Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you. I am sorry about all that unpleasantness. The silver hair of a true Targaryen. Xaro Xhoan Daxos, she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself."
7948,NARRATOR:The SPICE KING descends the staircase.
7949,"XARO: Very true, and yet they say that your grandfather, who sold pepper off the back of a wagon, married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself."
7950,"SPICE KING: Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather. Did my servants not offer you something to eat, to drink? I'll have them flogged in the square."
7951,"DAENERYS: Thank you, my lord. You are a gracious host, but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want."
7952,"SPICE KING: Oh, she has a talent for drama, this one. So, my little princess, what is it you want?"
7953,DAENERYS: My birthright. The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros.
7954,SPICE KING: I fear I'm no better than a servant in this regard. I cannot give you what I do not have.
7955,DAENERYS: I'm not asking you for the kingdoms. I'm asking you for ships.
7956,"SPICE KING: I need to cross the Narrow Sea. I need my ships as well. I use them, you see, to bring spices from one port to another."
7957,DAENERYS: Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne.
7958,SPICE KING: Retake? Did you once sit on the Iron Throne?
7959,"DAENERYS: My father sat there, before he was murdered."
7960,"SPICE KING: But if you did not sit on it yourself, would it not be correct to say ""take the Iron Throne""?"
7961,DAENERYS: I didn't come here to argue grammar.
7962,"SPICE KING: Of course not. You came to take my ships. So let me explain my position, little princess. Unlike you, I do not have exalted ancestors. I make my living by trade. And I judge every trade on its merits. You ask for ships. You say I shall be repaid triple. I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions. But before you repay your debts, you must seize the Seven Kingdoms. Do you have an army?"
7963,DAENERYS: Not yet.
7964,SPICE KING: You do not have an army. Do you have powerful allies in Westeros?
7965,DAENERYS: There are many there that support my claim.
7966,SPICE KING: When were you there last?
7967,DAENERYS: I left when I was a baby.
7968,"SPICE KING: So, in truth, you have no allies."
7969,DAENERYS: The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return.
7970,"SPICE KING: Ah. Forgive me, little princess, but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams. Now if you'll pardon me."
7971,"DAENERYS: Do you know lllyrio Mopatis, Magister of Pentos? Yes, we've met."
7972,SPICE KING: A shrewd man.
7973,"DAENERYS: For my wedding, he gave me three petrified dragon eggs. He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone. How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies? But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire, they would hatch. When I stepped into the fire, my own people thought I was mad. But when the fire burned out, I was unhurt, the Mother of Dragons."
7974,NARRATOR:DAENERYS ascends the stairs to meet the SPICE KING.
7975,DAENERYS: Do you understand? I'm no ordinary woman. My dreams come true.
7976,"SPICE KING: I admire your passion. But in business, I trust in logic, not passion. I'm sorry, little princess."
7977,"DAENERYS: I am not your little princess. I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria, and I will take what is mine. With fire and blood, I will take it."

7983,"ARYA: My father, my lord."
7984,"TYWIN: Hmm. I taught my son Jaime to read. The maester came to me one day, told me he wasn't learning. He couldn't make sense of the letters. He reversed them in his head. The maester said he'd heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it. Ha! After that, I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned. He hated me for it, for a time. For a long time. But he learned. Hmm. Where is your father? Is he alive? Who was he?"
7985,ARYA: A stonemason.
7986,TWYIN: A stonemason who could read? Hmm.

He turns to her, and she realizes her mistake. She continues on and finds JAQEN just a bit further on."
8016,ARYA: Amory Lorch.
8017,JAQEN: A girl has named a second name. A man will do what must be done.
8018,ARYA: Now!
8019,JAQEN: A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing. A man cannot make a thing happen before its time.

8036,ROBB: I'm not sure I'm a lady.
8037,TALISA: Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me.
8038,"ROBB: It's hard to keep all the rules straight. But if I remember my lessons, a woman of noble birth is always called a lady. Unless she's a queen or a princess. I could find someone who knows."
8039,TALISA: Why are you so sure I'm of noble birth?
8040,ROBB: Because it's obvious.
8041,"TALISA: What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge, and my mother, my brother and I lived with him above our shop?"

8120,ROBB: How can I call myself king if I can't hold my own castle? How can I ask men to follow me if I can't
8121,ROOSE: You are a king. And that means you don't have to do everything yourself.
8122,CATELYN: Let me go and talk to Theon.
8123,ROBB: There will be no talk. He will die for this.

We have the Lannisters on the run. If you march all the way back north now, you'll lose what you gained. My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theon's head."

And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?

8260,JON: It was my choice to say the words.
8261,YGRITTE: So you don't like girls?
8262,JON: Of course I like girls. But you chose never to touch them.
8263,JON: That's the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Night's Watch.
8264,"YGRITTE: So instead of getting naked with a girl, you'd prefer to invade our lands"
8265,"JON: Invade your lands? Wildlings raid our lands all the time. Some of them tried to kill my little brother, a crippled boy!"
8266,YGRITTE: Yhey're not your lands! We've been here the whole time. You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours.

8277,NARRATOR:ARYA sets the table and listens.
8278,MOUNTAIN: We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners.
8279,"TYWIN: Pretentious name for a band of outlaws. We can't allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity. We look like fools and they look like heroes. That's how kings fall. I want them dead, every one."
8280,"MOUNTAIN: Killing them isn't the problem. It's finding them. Have you gone soft, Clegane? I always thought you had a talent for violence."

8299,ARYA: (shakes her head)

8302,TYWIN: Do you know what legacy means? It's what you pass down to your children and your children's children. It's what remains of you when you're gone. Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy. The greatest fortress ever built.
8303,"NARRATOR:TYWIN walks to the fireplace.  The tallest towers, the strongest walls. The Great Hall had 35 hearths. Thirty-five. Can you imagine? Look at it now. A blasted ruin. Do you know what happened?"

8305,TYWIN: Yes. Dragons happened.
8306,NARRATOR:TYWIN pours himself some wine.

But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmm-mmm. Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls. Aegon Targaryen changed the rules. That's why every child alive still knows his name"
8308,ARYA: Aegon and his sisters.
8309,TYWIN: Mmm?
8310,"ARYA: It wasn't just Aegon riding his dragon. It was Rhaenys and Visenya, too."
8311,"TYWIN: Correct. A student of history, are you?"
8312,ARYA: Rhaenys rode Meraxes. Visenya rode Vhagar.
8313,TYWIN: I'm sure I knew that when I was a boy.
8314,ARYA: Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior. She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister.
8315,"TYWIN: Hmm. She's a heroine of yours, I take it?"
8316,ARYA: (smiles)
8317,TYWIN:  Aren't most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs? Jonquil with the flowers in her hair?
8318,ARYA: Most girls are idiots.
8319,TYWIN: You remind me of my daughter. Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword?
8320,ARYA: From my father.
8321,TYWIN: He was a well-read stonemason. Can't say I've ever met a literate stonemason.

If someone tried to tell us we couldn't lie down as man and woman, we'd shove a spear up his arse. We don't go serving some shit king who's only king because his father was."

I need fennel root for those with fever, willow bark. Mostly I need milk of the poppy. You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any.

And when he returned, he would present me with some pelts or a stag's head, and I would present him with a baby. Not that I wanted him there, mind you. I had Grand Maester Pycelle, an army of midwives, and I had my brother. When they told Jaime he wasn't allowed in the birthing room, he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out.

8546,"JAIME: You didn't, though."
8547,ALTON: You really remember?
8548,"JAIME: You knew when you were needed and when to go away. It's a rare talent. Most of my squires, they mean well, but young men with big jobs, they tend to overdo them."
8549,ALTON: When I think back to that day
8550,GUARD:  Shh!
8551,JAIME: You were saying?
8552,ALTON: I Never mind. It's embarrassing.
8553,JAIME: More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit?
8554,"ALTON: I remember everything about that day, your helmet, your horse, the rake lines in the dirt along the list, where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse, and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me. I'll remember it all until I die. That was the best day of my life. And I remember being on the field after it was over. All the competitors were done. I was the last one out there. And I couldn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride. And I couldn't bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you, when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about."
8555,JAIME: I understand completely.
8556,"ALTON: How could you? Sorry, I I didn't mean to doubt you."
8557,JAIME: It's just that I I was 16 once. I also had to replace someone's squire on short notice.
8558,ALTON: Which knight was it?
8559,JAIME: Barristan Selmy. The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws. Before your time.
8560,ALTON: What was he like?
8561,"JAIME: He was A painter. A painter who only used red. I couldn't imagine being able to fight like that, not back then. And to help him do that, to be a part of something that perfect. I don't need to explain how that felt, not to you."
8562,ALTON: It's hard to put into words.
8563,"JAIME: It's like stepping into a dream you've been dreaming for as long as you can remember, and finding out that the dream is more real than your life."
8564,ALTON: (nods) Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison.
8565,ALTON: Did you squire for him again?
8566,"JAIME: No. I didn't have your gift. He couldn't take a step without stepping on me. I was awful, a complete liability. Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16-year-old squire."
8567,ALTON: (smiles)
8568,"JAIME: It's a good thing I am who I am. I'd have been useless at anything else. I'm not well-suited for imprisonment. Shocking, I know. Some men are. Ned Stark, I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end. Not me, though. My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint."
8569,ALTON: And have you thought about
8570,JAIME: Of course. Every day.

8618,"XARO: An upstart and a charlatan? Empires have been built by less. Those on the margins often come to control the center, and those in the center make room for them, willingly or otherwise."
8619,"PYATT PREE: The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies. She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side, forever."

8661,"RICKARD KARSTARK: When your son returns, I will demand this murderer's head."

8676,CERSEI:  More than we have.
8677,"TYRION: Yes, that's more than we have. He'll be at our gates within five days, four if he has the wind."
8678,"CERSEI: We have strong, high walls. We'll rain fire down on them from above."
8679,"TYRION: ""Rain fire on them from above."" You're quoting Father, aren't you?"
8680,"CERSEI: Why not? He has a good mind for strategy, doesn't he?"
8681,"TYRION: Call it tactics, not strategy. But, yes, he does have a good mind for it. The best mind, some would say. Sadly, he's not here. It's just you, me and Joffrey, the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
8682,CERSEI: I'm sure you'll make a point eventually.
8683,TYRION: He needs to start acting like a king. This war you started is coming to our doorstep. And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
8684,CERSEI: I'm not the one giving the boy whores to abuse.
8685,TYRION: I thought the girls might help him.
8686,CERSEI: Did you?
8687,TYRION: I was wrong. If we can't control him
8688,CERSEI: Do you think I haven't tried? He doesn't listen to me.
8689,TYRION: It's hard to put a leash on a dog once you've put a crown on its head.
8690,CERSEI: I always hoped he'd be like Jaime. He looks like him. In a certain light.
8691,TYRION: The boy is more Robert than Jaime.
8692,"CESEI: Robert was a drunken fool, but he didn't enjoy cruelty. Sometimes I wonder. What? If this is the price for what we've done, for our sins."
8693,TYRION: Sins?
8694,"CERSEI: The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years, I know. That's what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt. It's what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me. Half the Targaryens went mad, didn't they? What's the saying? ""Every time a Targaryen is born, the Gods flip a coin."""
8695,"TYRION: You've beaten the odds. Tommen and Myrcella are good, decent children, both of them."

8717,CATELYN: Do you hear them out there? They want your head.
8718,JAIME: Old Lord Karstark doesn't seem to like me.
8719,CATELYN: You strangled his son with your chains.
8720,JAIME: Oh. Oh. Was he the one on guard duty? He was in my way. Any knight would have done the same.
8721,CATELYN: You are no knight. You have forsaken every vow you ever took.
8722,"JAIME: So many vows. They make you swear and swear. Defend the king, obey the king, obey your father, protect the innocent, defend the weak. But what if your father despises the king? What if the king massacres the innocent? It's too much. No matter what you do, you're forsaking one vow or another. Where did you find this beast?"
8723,"CATELYN: She is a truer knight than you will ever be, Kingslayer."
8724,"JAIME: Kingslayer. What a king he was. Here's to Aerys Targaryen, the Second of His Name, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, Protector of the Realm, and to the sword I shoved in his back."
8725,CATELYN: You are a man without honor.
8726,"JAIME: Do you know, I've never been with any woman but Cersei. So in my own way, I have more honor than poor old dead Ned. What was the name of that bastard he fathered?"
8727,CATELYN: Brienne.
8728,"JAIME: No, that wasn't it. Snow, a bastard from the North. Now, when When good old Ned came home with some whore's baby, did you pretend to love it? No. You're not very good at pretending. You're an honest woman. You hated that boy, didn't you? How could you not hate him? The walking, talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman."

8750,YARA:  What envy?
8751,THEON: You should be proud of your brother's achievement. I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men.
8752,"YARA: You're a great warrior. I saw the bodies above your gates. Which one gave you the tougher fight, the cripple or the six-year-old?"
8753,"THEON: I treated the Stark boys with honor, and they repaid me with treachery."
8754,YARA: You treated them with honor? By butchering them?

8760,THEON: Don't call me

8763,YARA: You are weak. And you're stupid.
8764,THEON: I'm warning you.
8765,"YARA: Go on, then. Warn me."
8766,NARRATOR:THEON pauses.
8767,THEON: You haven't brought enough men. How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot?
8768,YARA: You're not. I've come to bring you home. Father wants a word.
8769,THEON: Is this a joke? Winterfell is the heart of the North.
8770,"YARA: Aye, it is, hundreds of miles from the sea. We're islanders, baby brother. Had you forgotten that? Our power comes from our ships. And now that you've decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys, every man in the North wants to see you hanged. When Robb Stark finds out"
8771,THEON: He won't find out. We've killed all the ravens. We have all the horses. I've taken Winterfell. And I will keep Winterfell.

8775,THEON: I don't intend to die.
8776,"YARA: You were a terrible baby, do you know that? Bawling all the time, never sleeping. And one night, you just wouldn't shut up, screaming like a dying pig. I walked over to your crib, I looked down at you. I wanted to strangle you. And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming. You smiled at me. Don't die so far from the sea."

8818,"TALISA: When I speak to people from the North, they all loved your father."

8820,"TALISA: Children do not always think that about their fathers, believe me."
8821,"ROBB: He once told me that being a lord is like being a father, except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them. The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect. The charwomen scrubbing the floors, yours to protect. The soldiers you order into battle. He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night. I didn't believe him. I asked him, ""How can a man be brave if he's afraid?"" ""That is the only time a man can be brave,"" he told me."
8822,TALISA: I wish I could have met him.
8823,ROBB: He would have liked you.
8824,TALISA: (chuckles) Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors.
8825,ROBB: He didn't care much about gold or glory.
8826,TALISA:  And you? You think I'm fighting this war so they'll sing songs about me? I want to go home. I want the men following me to go home.

8844,"RICKARD KARSTARK: I lost one son fighting by your son's side. I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain. You commit treason because your children are prisoners? I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell."
8845,"CATELYN:  I grieve for your sons, my lord."
8846,RICKARD KARSTARK: I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance. And you stole it from me.

8875,JAIME: The answer is no. There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me. You're not one of them.

8913,"HOT PIE: You need sour cherries to make it right. And the secret is you dry the stones, and then you break them with a mallet. That's where the real flavor is. You crush 'em up real fine. And then when you're finished, you sprinkle them over the piecrust."
8914,NARRATOR:ARYA enters.
8915,ARYA: Where's Jaqen?
8916,HOT PIE: How would I know?

8918,GENDRY: You need him?
8919,ARYA:  He's helping me.
8920,HOT PIE: I saw him.
8921,ARYA: Where?

8935,QUORIN: They might. If you do what needs to be done.
8936,JON: What?
8937,QUORIN: (yelling) How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl?

8945,BRONN: I like to keep me hands clean.
8946,"TYRION: Yes, but do you have to do it here?"
8947,"NARRATOR:BRONN looks at TYRION, then throws the compass down on the desk in front of him."
8948,TYRION: You should start wearing the gold cloak.
8949,BRONN: I don't want to wear a gold cloak.
8950,TYRION: You're commander of the City Watch. You shouldn't be dressed like a common
8951,"BRONN: A cloak slows you down in a fight. Makes it hard to move quietly. And the gold catches the light, so you're nice and easy to spot at night."
8952,"TYRION: Well, you're not sneaking through alleyways any longer. You're supposed to stand out."
8953,BRONN: We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasn't part of it.
8954,"TYRION: Fine, fine. No gold cloak."
8955,"NARRATOR:TYRION goes back to his work. BRONN sucks his teeth and drums his finger, continuing to look at TYRION."
8956,TYRION: What?
8957,BRONN:  What?
8958,TYRION: What? What? Why are you staring at me?
8959,BRONN: (scoffs) You don't want me cleaning me nails. You don't want me looking your way. Why am I here?
8960,TYRION: To help me plan the defense of King's Landing.
8961,"NARRATOR:BRONN laughs as he stands up, and begins to pace around."
8962,TYRION: Stannis will be here any day.
8963,NARRATOR:BRONN picks up a book from the pile as he walks past.
8964,BRONN: And one of these explains how to beat him?

8968,NARRATOR:VARYS enters.
8969,VARYS: My Lord Hand. Commander. I must compliment you on the gold cloaks' performance these last few weeks. Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery?
8970,NARRATOR:He sits.
8971,TYRION: I did not know. And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery?
8972,BRONN: Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves.
8973,TYRION: For questioning?
8974,BRONN: No. It's just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now.
8975,TYRION: We talked about this.
8976,"BRONN: Aye, we talked about it. Have you ever been in a city under siege? Maybe this part's not in your books. See, it's not the fighting that kills most people. It's the starving. Food's worth more than gold. Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes. Things get bad enough, the poor start eating each other."
8977,NARRATOR:BRONN sits back down at the table.
8978,"BRONN: The thieves, they love a siege. Soon as the gates are sealed, they steal all the food. By the time it's all over, they're the richest men in town."
8979,"VARYS: Given the circumstances, my lord, I believe extreme measures are warranted."
8980,BRONN: (nods)
8981,"VARYS: Ah. ""The Great Sieges of Westeros."" Thrilling subject. Shame Archmaester Ch'Vyalthan wasn't a better writer."
8982,NARRATOR:TYRION grabs a parchment and unrolls it.
8983,"TYRION: Stannis knows King's Landing. He knows where the walls are strongest, and he knows which gates are weakest. The Mud Gate. A good ram will batter it down in minutes, and it's only 50 yards from the water. That's where he'll land."
8984,"VARYS: And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate, what is our plan?"
8985,BRONN: We could throw books at his men.
8986,VARYS: We don't have that many books.
8987,"BRONN: We don't have that many men, either."
8988,VARYS: What do we have?

8994,EDDISON: I always imagined meself doing something much worse.
8995,GRENN: We're digging latrine pits at the end of the world. I can't imagine anything much worse.
8996,EDDISON: You lack imagination.
8997,SAM: Where do you think Jon is right now?
8998,EDDISION: He went off with the Halfhand. He didn't come back. A betting man would go with dead.
8999,"SAM: He's not dead. No, Jon's a great fighter."
9000,"GRENN: Well, he's better than me and a lot better than you."
9001,SAM: He's got a Valyrian steel sword.
9002,EDDISION: So did his father.
9003,SAM: And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive.

9008,SAM: The First Men made these marks. Help me with it.
9009,NARRATOR:GRENN lifts the cover and finds a bundle wrapped in a cloak.
9010,GRENN: Look.
9011,"EDDISION: If you find something you're not supposed to, best thing to do is pretend you've never seen it."
9012,SAM: That's a Night's Watch cloak.
9013,GRENN: It's been here a long time.
9014,NARRATOR:GRENN opens the bundle to reveal a set of obsidian knifes.
9015,SAM: Oh. Must be dragonglass.
9016,GRENN: Dragonglass?
9017,SAM: The maesters call it obsidian.
9018,GRENN: Why would a brother hide it here?

9031,"JAQEN: A minute, an hour, a month. Death is certain, the time is not."
9032,NARRATOR:JAQEN puts down his helmet and sits.
9033,ARYA: He's taking his army to attack my brother. I need him dead right now.
9034,JAQEN: This a man cannot do.

9041,NARRATOR:JAQEN considers.
9042,JAQEN: A girl gives a man his own name?
9043,ARYA:  That's right.
9044,JAQEN:  Gods are not mocked. This is no joking thing.

9062,CERSEI: Odd little boy.
9063,TYRION: I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys.
9064,CERSEI: You and Varys both.
9065,NARRATOR:TYRION removes his napkin from his neck and wipes his face.
9066,TYRION: Excellent lamprey pie. Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day? I hear Joffrey plans on fighting. An inspiration for the troops. The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel.
9067,CERSEI: He's only a boy.
9068,TYRION: Younger boys are off fighting his war.
9069,CERSEI: He's not ready.
9070,"TYRION: What is he, 17? Remember Jaime at 17?"
9071,"CERSEI: Better than you. Some men have a gift for this sort of thing, some don't. His place is not on the battlefield."
9072,"TYRION: It's not on the throne, either, sadly for all of us."
9073,NARRATOR:PODRICK snickers.
9074,CERSEI: Do you think I'm an idiot?
9075,"TYRION: No, I'd say you possess above-average intelligence."
9076,CERSEI: You shipped off my only daughter. And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die.
9077,TYRION: He'll have his Kingsguard protecting him. He has the finest armor gold can buy. He needs to be out there. The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mother's skirts. Any dessert?
9078,CERSEI: Do you know why Varys is so dangerous?
9079,TYRION: Because he has thousands of spies in his employ. Because he knows everything we do before we do it.
9080,CERSEI: Because he doesn't have a cock.
9081,TYRION: Neither do you.
9082,"CERSEI: Perhaps I'm dangerous, too. You, on the other hand, are as big a fool as every other man. That little worm between your legs does half your thinking."
9083,TYRION: It's not that little.
9084,CERSEI: (laughs)
9085,TYRION: Why are you smiling?
9086,CERSEI: Because I'm happy.
9087,TYRION: And why are you happy?
9088,NARRATOR:She sits.
9089,CERSEI: Because I have your little whore.
9090,TYRION: I thought you preferred blondes.
9091,"CERSEI: Such a droll little fellow. Tell me, have you married this one yet? No? Good. Father will be so pleased."
9092,TYRION: Why do you care who I fuck?
9093,"CERSEI: Because a Lannister always pays her debts. You stole my only daughter, you plot to have Joffrey killed."
9094,TYRION: This is madness. Stannis will be here in days. You need me.
9095,"CERSEI: For what? Your skill in battle? Pretty thing, your whore. Lovely body. The bruises will heal in time."
9096,TYRION: Where did you find her?
9097,"CERSEI: Varys isn't the only one who hears whispers. Really, a Lannister lion necklace? You need to hide your secret whores more carefully."
9098,TYRION: You've forgotten the most important thing about whores.
9099,"CERSEI: Oh? Well, you're the expert. Tell me."
9100,"TYRION: You don't buy them, you only rent them."
9101,"CERSEI: You're usually a better liar, baby brother. This one you like. You like her very much. Could it be love? Don't worry, she'll be treated gently enough. Unless Joffrey is hurt. And then every wound he suffers, she'll suffer, too. And if he dies, there isn't a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt."
9102,TYRION: And how do I know you haven't killed her already?
9103,"CERSEI: Would you like to see her? I thought you might. Ser Mandon, bring in my brother's whore."

9137,"ROOSE: A touch of mercy is a virtue, Your Grace. Too much"
9138,ROBB: Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy. He betrayed our cause. He betrayed me. And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs.

9146,TALISA: I'm sorry. It was a stupid question. I'm sorry.
9147,ROBB: No. Forgive me. You're being kind. I have no right.
9148,TALISA: You have every right. You're a king.
9149,ROBB: That's not the kind of king I want to be.
9150,TALISA: What kind do you want to be?
9151,ROBB: I don't know. The good kind. Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown. I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.
9152,"TALISA: I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry."

9156,ROBB: How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off men's feet?
9157,"TALISA: When I was 12, my mother and father went to a wedding. Weddings in Volantis last for days, you know. And they left me with my little brother. The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the three-year summer. We couldn't bear to be inside, so we ran down to the Rhoyne. Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day. The rich, the poor, we were all there. Naked, screaming, racing to the little islands. Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank. I was treading water, talking to a friend, when I realized I hadn't seen my brother. I called his name. Then I started screaming his name. And then I saw him floating face down. My heart just stopped. I was I dragged him from the water. My friend helped me, I think. I don't even remember. He was so little. Then we pulled him onto the riverbank. And I screamed at him and I shook him. And he was dead. Just dead. A man ran over. He had a fish tattoo on his face. In Volantis, the slaves have tattoos. So you know what they are without having to talk to them. And this man worked on a fishing boat. And he pushed me out of the way. You have to understand, for a slave to push a highborn girl, that's death for the man, a terrible death. But he pushed me out of the way, and he started pressing on my brother's chest again and again and again, until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out. And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm. I decided two things that day. I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies. And when I came of age, I would never live in a slave city again. I'm sorry, Your Grace. You told me of your problems and I've blathered on."
9158,NARRATOR:They both stand.
9159,ROBB: I don't want to marry the Frey girl.

9195,DAVOS: My father was a crabber.
9196,STANNIS: And?
9197,"DAVOS:  Well, sons of lords don't like to break bread with sons of crabbers. Our hands stink."

9208,"STANNIS: First, we ate the horses. We weren't riding anywhere, not with the castle surrounded. We couldn't feed them, so fine, the horses. Then the cats. Never liked cats. So fine. I do like dogs. Good animals. Loyal. But we ate them. Then the rats. The night before you slipped through, I thought my wife was dying. She couldn't speak anymore, she was so frail. And then you made it through the lines. Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions."
9209,"DAVOS: And potatoes. Some salted beef, I believe."
9210,STANNIS:  Every man in Storm's End wanted to kiss you that night.
9211,DAVOS: I was relieved they did not.
9212,"STANNIS: Robert told me to hold Storm's End, so I held it. Then he told me he was giving it to Renly, so I gave it up. Insult or no, I gave it up. Because Robert was my older brother, and he was the king and I've always done my duty. But now, I'm the rightful king by every law of Westeros. And when I sit the Iron Throne, you'll be my Hand."
9213,"DAVOS: Your Grace, I pray I serve you well."
9214,STANNIS: I expect you'll be the first crabber's son to wear the badge.

9216,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY, VARYS and TYRION walk through the streets of King's Landing"
9217,JOFFREY: You're the Master of Whisperers. You're supposed to know everything.
9218,"VARYS: No man can be in all rooms at all times. I have many little birds in the North, my lord, but I haven't heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell."
9219,JOFFREY: The Stark forces are distracted. Now is the time to strike.
9220,"TYRION: To strike? My dear nephew, you do see these men preparing the walls for siege? You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way?"
9221,"JOFFREY: If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of King's Landing, I'll ride out to greet him."
9222,"TYRION: A brave choice, Your Grace. I'm sure your men will line up behind you."
9223,JOFFREY: They say Stannis never smiles. I'll give him a red smile from ear to ear.
9224,NARRATOR:JOFFREY exits.
9225,TYRION: Imagine Stannis' terror.
9226,VARYS: I am trying.
9227,TYRION: You're an intelligent man. I'd like to think I'm an intelligent man.
9228,"VARYS: Oh, no one disputes that, my lord, not even the multitudes who despise you."
9229,"TYRION: I wish we could converse as two honest, intelligent men."
9230,"VARYS: I wish we could, too."
9231,TYRION: What do you want? Tell me.
9232,"VARYS: If we're going to play, you'll have to start."
9233,"TYRION: My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history. My sister became queen at the age of 19. When I reached manhood, my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock."
9234,VARYS: A most highborn plumber.
9235,TYRION: The water never flowed better. And all the shit found its way to the sea. I never expected to have any real power. So when my father named me acting Hand
9236,TYRION:  I do. Last thing I expected.
9237,VARYS: And you play it well.
9238,"TYRION: I'd like to keep playing it. If Stannis breaches the gates, the game is over."
9239,VARYS: They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light.
9240,"TYRION:  The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned, the Drowned God wants them drowned. Why are all the gods such vicious cunts? Where is the god of tits and wine?"
9241,"VARYS: In the Summer Isles, they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats."
9242,TYRION: We should sail there immediately.
9243,"VARYS: This morning, I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste. Daenerys Targaryen lives."
9244,TYRION: A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems.
9245,"VARYS: She has three dragons. But even if what they say is true, it'll be years before they are fully grown. And then there will be nowhere to hide."
9246,"TYRION: One game at a time, my friend."

9250,DAENERYS: Astapor?
9251,JORAH: We cannot stay here.
9252,DAENERYS: They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.
9253,"JORAH: They're not your children. I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them, but you didn't grow them in your womb. They didn't suckle at your breast. They are dragons, Khaleesi. And if we stay in Qarth, we'll die."
9254,DAENERYS: You should sail to Astapor. I'm sure you'll be safe there.
9255,"JORAH: You know I would die for you. I will never abandon you. I'm sworn to protect you, to serve."
9256,"DAENERYS: Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there."
9257,"JORAH: That's what the warlock wants. He told you so himself. If you enter that place, you will never leave again. His magic is strong."
9258,DAENERYS:  And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire. You watched the witch burn. What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?
9259,"JORAH: Until my last breath, I will remember. After I have forgotten my mother's face."
9260,NARRATOR:DAENERYS touches JORAH's face.
9261,DAENERYS: They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.

9264,THEON: We should bury them.
9265,DAGMER: I'd leave 'em up a few more days. Sends a message.
9266,"THEON: If they haven't got the damn message yet, a few more days won't help. As you say. But it don't hurt to let 'em rot a while longer."
9267,DAGMER: What's this?
9268,THEON: Gold for the farmer. For his trouble.
9269,DAGMER: His troubles are done. He's feeding the crops now.
9270,NARRATOR:LUWIN approaches and exchanges a glance with OSHA. She ducks into an entryway. LUWIN looks at THEON and DAGMER.
9271,"DAGMER: His wife, too. You want to keep a man silent, you silence him."

9273,CUT TO: DARKNESS
9274,NARRATOR:OSHA lights a candle.
9275,OSHA: Got as far as the farm and then doubled back. Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds. Hoped this would be the last place they'd think to look.
9276,LUWIN: You're right so far.
9277,OSHA: Who was that out there hung up at the gates?
9278,LUWIN: Must have been the farmer's boys.
9279,OSHA: He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords?
9280,LUWIN: They mustn't know. Bran would blame himself.
9281,OSHA: They'll never hear it from me. The little lads have suffered enough.

9289,MATTHOS: That's it. The tide's against us.
9290,"DAVOS: Aye, but we have the wind. She'll blow us straight to the gates."
9291,MATTHOS: You're coming home.
9292,DAVOS: King's Landing hasn't been home for 20 years. I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet. And now I'm sailing right at them.
9293,"MATTHOS: This is the royal fleet. And you're not a smuggler anymore, you're the high captain."
9294,"DAVOS: Of course, there are several royal fleets at the moment."
9295,"MATTHOS: Not after tonight. When the sun rises, Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand."
9296,DAVOS: Gods be good.
9297,"MATTHOS: God. Father, there is only one and he watches over us."
9298,DAVOS: But not over them?
9299,"MATTHOS: Over all of us. The people of King's Landing did not choose the false king, Joffrey Baratheon. They will be glad to see his head on a spike."
9300,"DAVOS: Well, first, we have to put it there."
9301,MATTHOS: Our ships outnumber theirs 10-to-1.
9302,"DAVOS: Our army outnumber theirs 5-to-1. Those walls have never been breached, and the men guarding the walls, when they see you, they don't see a liberator, they see a stranger come to set their city on fire."
9303,MATTHOS: I have faith in the Lord of Light. I have faith in our cause. And I have faith in my captain.

9307,"TYRION: If the city falls, Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find. Of course I'm afraid."
9308,SHAE: I won't let them hurt you.
9309,TYRION: I'm a Lannister. I don't have a choice in all this. But it's not your war.

9311,SHAE: It is now.
9312,TYRION: You can't fuck your way out of everything.

9317,"PYCELLE: As you know, Your Grace, it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves, but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war."
9318,CERSEI: Your words are always wise and measured.
9319,CERSEI: You brought me something?
9320,"PYCELLE: Yes. Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious. A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves. Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep. Ten drops, however"
9321,CERSEI: I know what ten drops will bring.
9322,"PYCELLE: Your Grace, if I may ask"
9323,CERSEI: You may not. You must have a lot of work to do. I'm sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon.

9337,NARRATOR:BRONN pulls her to stand in front of him.
9338,"BRONN: Well, now let's see. First time, I was five. My mam smacked me with an iron poker."
9339,PROSTITUTE:  Oh.
9340,BRONN: It wasn't me she was aiming at. She was trying for my little brother. Now he was a real pest.
9341,NARRATOR:BRONN start to undress her.
9342,"BRONN: Second time, I was nine. Got in a scrap with a few older boys. They won. Third time"

9382,TYRION: There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city.
9383,VARYS: Closer to 50. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary.
9384,"TYRION:  I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship, and if the ship goes down, I go with her."
9385,"VARYS: That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, my lord."
9386,"TYRION:  Well, I'm not."

9388,TYRION: What of it?
9389,"VARYS: You don't believe in the old powers, my lord?"
9390,"TYRION: Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting. What do you think?"
9391,VARYS: I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me.
9392,"TYRION: Mmm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself."
9393,"VARYS: And yet I have seen things and heard things, things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut."
9394,"TYRION: No, I don't believe you have."
9395,"VARYS: One day, I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him."

9438,SANSA: Will you slay him yourself?
9439,JOFFREY: If Stannis is fool enough to come near me.
9440,SANSA: So you'll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard?
9441,JOFFREY: A king doesn't discuss battle plans with stupid girls.
9442,"SANSA: I'm sorry, Your Grace. You're right, I'm stupid. Of course you'll be in the vanguard. They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest. And he is only a pretender."

9454,"JOFFREY: Hound, tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question."
9455,HOUND: The king has asked you a question.
9456,"TYRION: Ser Lancel, tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy. LANCEL: The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king-"
9457,"JOFFREY: If I tell the Hound to cut you in half, he'll do it without a second thought."
9458,"TYRION: That would make me the quarterman. It just doesn't have the same ring to it. Cut me in half and I won't be able to give the signal. No signal, no plan. No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city, takes the Iron Throne, puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere. It might be quite amusing, except that my head would be up there, too. I've never much liked my head, but I don't want to see it removed just yet."

9460,DAVOS: Where are their ships?
9461,MATTHOS: It was wise to attack at night. We took them by surprise.
9462,DAVOS: Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago. There are no surprises here.
9463,"MATTHOS: If it's true there is dissension in their ranks, maybe their sailors have mutinied."
9464,DAVOS: Maybe.

9467,SANSA: I don't know why she wants me here. She's always saying how stupid I am. She hates me.
9468,SHAE: Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else.
9469,SANSA: I doubt it.
9470,SHAE: Maybe she's jealous of you.
9471,SANSA: Why would she be jealous?
9472,CERSEI: Sansa.
9473,NARRATOR:SANSA gets up and walks over to her.
9474,"CERSEI: I was wondering where our little dove had flown. You look pale, child. Is your red flower still blooming?"
9475,SANSA: Yes.
9476,"CERSEI: Fitting, isn't it? The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here. Pour Lady Sansa some wine."
9477,NARRATOR:A servant pours the wine. CERSEI hands it to SANSA.
9478,"SHAE: I'm not thirsty, Your Grace."
9479,CERSEI: So? I didn't offer you water. What's he doing here?
9480,"CERSEI: Ser llyn? He's here to defend us. When the axes smash down those doors, you may be glad to have him."
9481,SANSA: But we have guards to defend us.
9482,"CERSEI: Guards we have paid. Should the city fall, they'll be the first ones out of the doors."
9483,NARRATOR:A door opens and a gold cloak walks in. He bows to CERSEI.
9484,GOLD CLOACK: The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups.
9485,CERSEI: The battle's first traitors. Have Ser llyn see to them. Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning.
9486,"NARRATOR:He bows and moves to ILYN PAYNE, then exits the chamber."
9487,CERSEI: The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy. Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen.
9488,SANSA: You said he was here to protect us.
9489,CERSEI: He is. Traitors are a danger to us all. More wine.

My mother had just died, you see. I didn't really understand the concept of death, the finality of it. I thought that if I prayed very, very hard, the gods would return my mother to me. I was four."

9573,SANSA: And if the city should fall?
9574,"CERSEI: You'd like that, wouldn't you? The Red Keep should hold for a time, long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person. If it were anyone else outside those gates, I might have hoped for a private audience, but this is Stannis Baratheon. I'd have a better chance of seducing his horse."

9578,"CERSEI: Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked? No, you wouldn't, would you? If the city falls, these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape. Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning. You'll be glad of your red flower then. When a man's blood is up, anything with tits looks good.

I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson, the king, quivered in fear behind the walls. I bled in the mud for our family. And as my reward, I was trundled off to some dark little cell. But what do I want? A little bloody gratitude would be a start."

And when the time is right, you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy. And if you serve faithfully, you will be rewarded with a suitable wife. And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock."
10107,TYRION: Why?
10108,"TYWIN: Why? You ask that? You, who killed your mother to come into the world? You are an ill-made, spiteful little creature full of envy, lust, and low cunning. Men's laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine. And to teach me humility, the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my father's sigil and his father's before him. But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse. Go, now. Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock. Go."

10124,SANSA: That's not how the game works. You're not supposed to just blurt out the right answer. You've got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why.
10125,SHAE: Why should I make up a story when I know the truth?
10126,NARRATOR:Littlefinger and Ros walk onto the dock.

10134,SANSA: Arya's alive? You said you'd take me home.
10135,LITTLEFINGER: You said King's Landing was your home. You are the property of the crown. Stealing you would be treason. If you were to tell just one person ...
10136,SANSA: I won't tell anyone.
10137,LITTLEFINGER: How do I know?
10138,"SANSA: Because I'm a terrible liar. You said so yourself. Please, Lord Baelish. Tell me what to do. Tell me when."
10139,"LITTLEFINGER: I'm waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital. When I set sail, I might be able to take you with me. But you'll need to be ready to leave on a moment's notice."
10140,"NARRATOR:Further back on the dock, Ros approaches Shae"
10141,ROS: You're her handmaiden?
10142,SHAE: Yes. And you're his...?
10143,ROS: I help manage his affairs.
10144,SHAE: He's an important person.
10145,"ROS: So is she. I grew up in the shadow of her father's castle. The day she was born, they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset. We've both done rather well, you and I."
10146,SHAE: Yes.
10147,ROS: Given where we started.
10148,SHAE: And where is that?
10149,ROS: It's not easy for girls like us to dig our way out. Watch out for her.

10158,JORAH: We'll be in Astapor by nightfall. Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world.

10160,JORAH: Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne?
10161,DAENERYS: It's too beautiful a day to argue.

10178,DAVOS: By burning prisoners alive?
10179,"MELISANDRE: How would you punish the infidels, Ser Davos?"
10180,"DAVOS: I do not judge people for the gods they worship. If I did, I'd have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone."
10181,MELISANDRE: I'm not your enemy.
10182,DAVOS: You are my enemy.
10183,"MELISANDRE: Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay? Did I set your ships ablaze? I wasn't there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands. I could have saved those men. You would have taken the city, Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne, and you would stand beside him. But I wasn't there because you convinced your king to leave me behind. Do you hear them screaming? All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers, for their gods for help? Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them."
10184,"NARRATOR:Melissandre touches Davos's cheek, and he recoils."

10232,"MARGAERY: Was your father a soldier, too?"
10233,NARRATOR:Child #2 nods

10243,NARRATOR:They bow.
10244,"JOFFREY: Please, sit. Sit. I do apologize, my lady. Small council meetings. At what point does it become treason to waste the king's time?"
10245,MARGAERY: ( laughs )
10246,"JOFFREY: That's a lovely gown, my lady."
10247,"CERSEI: Yes, it suits you perfectly. I imagine you might be rather cold."

10249,"JOFFREY: Shall I have them bring you a shawl, my lady?"

10251,LORAS: Yes.
10252,"MARGAERY: Loras, isn't the queen's gown magnificent? The fabric, the embroidery, the metalwork. I've never seen anything like it."
10253,"NARRATOR:They all sit at the table, and servants begin to pour the wine."
10254,CERSEI: You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen. Perhaps before. Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning.
10255,MARGAERY: Yes. I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about.
10256,LORAS: Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden.
10257,MARGAERY: The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart.
10258,"CERSEI: Cersei: An open heart is what you'll get in Flea Bottom if you're not careful, my dear. Not long ago, we were attacked by a mob there. We had a full complement of guards that didn't stop them. The king barely escaped with his life."
10259,JOFFREY: My mother's always had a penchant for drama. Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older. Our lives were never truly in danger.
10260,"CERSEI: You're right, of course. But you are your father's son. We can't all have a king's bravery."
10261,NARRATOR:There is an awkward pause as the main course is brought to the table.
10262,"MARGAERY: Hunger turns men into beasts. I'm glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard. They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach. Wheat, barley, apples. We've had a blessed harvest. And, of course, it's our duty to assist the capital in time of need."
10263,"JOFFREY: Well, as Ser Loras said, Lady Margaery has done this sort of... charitable work before. I'm sure she knows what she's doing."

10308,"DAENERYS: You take a babe from its mother's arms, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?"
10309,MISSANDEI: ( speaking Valyrian ) She is offended. She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby.

10381,TYRION: I am the Imp. I have certain standards to maintain.

10398,TYRION: 'Roslin caught a fine fat trout. Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding. Signed Walder Frey.' Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something?
10399,JOFFREY: Robb Stark is dead. And his bitch mother. (to Pycelle) Write back to Lord Frey. Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Stark's head. I'm going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.
10400,"VARYS: Your Grace, Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage."
10401,CERSEI: A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.
10402,"JOFFREY: Yes, I did. I'm going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast."
10403,TYRION: No. She is no longer yours to torment.
10404,"JOFFREY: Everyone is mine to torment. You'd do well to remember that, you little monster."
10405,"TYRION: Oh, I'm a monster. Perhaps you should speak to me more softly, then. Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies."
10406,NARRATOR:The room goes silent. JOFFREY is aghast at the slight.
10407,JOFFREY: I could have your tongue out for saying that.
10408,NARRATOR:CERSEI takes JOFFREY's hand to calm him.
10409,CERSEI: Let him make his threats. Hmm? He's a bitter little man.
10410,"PYCELLE: Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately. Unacceptable, disrespectful, and in very bad taste."
10411,NARRATOR:JOFFREY pulls his hand free from his mother's caress.
10412,JOFFREY: I am the king! I will punish you.
10413,"TYWIN: Any man who must say, 'I am the king' is no true king. I'll make sure you understand that when I've won your war for you."
10414,JOFFREY: My father won the real war. He killed Prince Rhaegar. He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock!
10415,"NARRATOR:Once again, the room goes silent as the depth of the insult sinks in."
10416,TYWIN: The king is tired. See him to his chambers.
10417,NARRATOR:CERSEI stands and tries to lead JOFFREY away.
10418,CERSEI: Come along.
10419,JOFFREY: I'm not tired.
10420,CERSEI: We have so much to celebrate. A wedding to plan. You must rest.
10421,NARRATOR:CERSEI pulls JOFFREY towards the door.
10422,"TYWIN: Grand Maester, perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep."
10423,JOFFREY: I'm not tired!
10424,CERSEI: Come.
10425,"NARRATOR:CERSEI and JOFFREY exit. PYCELLE stands, takes the scroll from the table, and shuffles out. Next, VARYS rises smoothly to depart. TYRION cautiously swivels to leave as well."
10426,TYWIN: Not you.
10427,NARRATOR:TYRION measures the situation as VARYS exits.
10428,TYRION: You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper.
10429,TYWIN: You're a fool if you believe he's the most powerful man in Westeros.
10430,TYRION: A treasonous statement. Joffrey is king.
10431,TYWIN: You really think a crown gives you power?
10432,NARRATOR:TYRION sits back down at the table.
10433,TYRION: No. I think armies give you power.
10434,TYWIN: Mm-hmm.
10435,"TYRION: Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle, and you defeated him all the same."
10436,TYWIN: Mm-hmm.
10437,"TYRION: Oh, I know. Walder Frey gets all the credit. Or the blame, I suppose, depending on your allegiance. Walder Frey is many things, but a brave man? No. He never would have risked such an action if he didn't have certain assurances."
10438,TYWIN: Which he got from me. Do you disapprove?
10439,TYRION: I'm all for cheating. This is war.
10440,"TYWIN: But to slaughter them at a wedding. Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10,000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner."
10441,TYRION: So that's why you did it? To save lives?
10442,"TYWIN: To end the war. To protect the family. Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks? Go ahead, write one. I'm in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters, to defend my blood."
10443,TYRION: The northerners will never forget.
10444,TYWIN: Good. Let them remember what happens when they march on the south. All the Stark men are dead. Winterfell is a ruin. Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age.
10445,NARRATOR:TYWIN gathers his paper and stands.
10446,TYWIN: I believe you still have some work to do on that score.
10447,TYRION: Do you think she'll open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother?
10448,"NARRATOR:TYWIN places the papers on his desk, as TYRION approaches."
10449,"TYWIN: One way or another, you will get that girl pregnant."
10450,TYRION: I will not rape her.
10451,TYWIN: Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works?
10452,TYRION: Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.
10453,TYWIN: The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first. A good man does everything in his power to better his family's position regardless of his own selfish desires.
10454,TYRION: (smirks)
10455,TYWIN: Does that amuse you?
10456,"TYRION: No, it's a very good lesson. Only it's easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when you're making all the decisions."
10457,"TYWIN: Easy for me, is it?"
10458,TYRION: When have you ever done something that wasn't in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family?
10459,"TYWIN: The day that you were born. I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away. Instead, I let you live. And I brought you as my son. Because you're a Lannister."
10460,NARRATOR:TYWIN walks away.
10461,INT: TYRION's chambers
10462,NARRATOR:TYRION enters to find SANSA staring out the window.
10463,TYRION: Sansa.
10464,"NARRATOR:SANSA turns to him. Her face is wet and swollen from crying. She looks at TYRION with disdain. She turns back to the window, and TYRION lets her be."
10465,EXT: The North
10466,"NARRATOR:MEERA jogs across the rough landscape, bow in her hand and Summer at her side. She reaches JOJEN, BRAN and HODOR."
10467,MEERA: It's empty.
10468,JOJEN: Let's find a place to sleep.
10469,NARRATOR:They walk together.
10470,"INT: The abandonded Nightfort, a bit later."
10471,NARRATOR:A fire crackles behind HODOR as he looks down into a well. He plays with his echo.
10472,HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
10473,"BRAN: Don't, Hodor."
10474,"NARRATOR:HODOR stops and joins the others. MEERA whittles while JOJEN cooks at the fire. BRAN sits pensively, his hand exploring the rough wooden table at his side."
10475,BRAN: Maybe we shouldn't stay.
10476,MEERA: You'd rather be out there?
10477,BRAN: There are a lot of stories about this place. Horrible stories.
10478,JOJEN: I always quite liked the horrible stories.
10479,BRAN: So did I. Once.
10480,NARRATOR:JOJEN moves to sit with the others.
10481,BRAN: You ever heard about the Rat Cook?
10482,MEERA: No. Who's he?
10483,"BRAN: Just a cook in the Night's Watch. He was angry at the king for something, I don't remember. When the king was visiting the Nightfort, the cook killed the king's son, cooked him into a big pie with onions, carrots, mushrooms and bacon. That night he served the pie to the king. He liked the taste of his son so much, he asked for a second slice. The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young. He's been roaming the Nightfort ever since, devouring his own babies. But no matter what he does, he's always hungry."
10484,MEERA: If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat--
10485,BRAN: It wasn't for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the king's son in a pie. He killed a guest beneath his roof. That's something the gods can't forgive.
10486,"INT: The Twins, dining hall."
10487,"NARRATOR:WALDER eats noisily in the large, empty dining hall. ROOSE BOLTON sands nearby. Servants scrub blood from the floor."
10488,"WALDER: 'The late Walder Frey,' old Hoster called me because I didn't get my men to the Trident in time for battle. He thought he was witty. Look at us now, Tully. You're dead, your daughter-Catelyn's dead, your grandson's dead, your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and I'm Lord of Riverrun. (laughs)"
10489,ROOSE BOLTON: The Blackfish escaped.
10490,WALDER: An old man on the run with no allies. I have Tywin Lannister backing me. Who does he have?
10491,ROOSE BOLTON: As you say.
10492,"WALDER: They all laughed at me, all those high lords. They all thought they were better than me. Ned Stark, Hoster Tully. People snigger when I marry a young girl, but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch?"
10493,ROOSE BOLTON: You'll be needing a new young girl.
10494,WALDER: Yeah. Got that to look forward to.
10495,ROOSE BOLTON: (grunts)
10496,"WALDER: And you, the Warden of the North. No more Starks to bow and scrape to. Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country."
10497,ROOSE BOLTON: He ignored my advice at every turn. If he'd been a trifle less arrogant--
10498,WALDER: Calling himself the Young Wolf. How's that for pomposity?
10499,ROOSE BOLTON: (nods)
10500,"WALDER: Well, here's to the Young Wolf! (howls)"
10501,ROOSE BOLTON: Forever young.
10502,NARRATOR:They both laugh.
10503,WALDER: Will you move to Winterfell now that the war's over?
10504,ROOSE BOLTON: At some point perhaps. But Winterfell's in ruins.
10505,"WALDER: Yeah. What happened up there? I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place. I heard he killed all the ravens. And after that, nothing."
10506,ROOSE BOLTON: I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.  Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon.
10507,WALDER: Oh. And?
10508,"INT: A Dungeon, somewhere."
10509,"NARRATOR:RAMSAY sits, merrily eating a sausage. THEON is strapped once again to the X-shaped cross."
10510,"RAMSAY: Well, the girls weren't lying. You had a good-sized cock."
10511,"NARRATOR:THEON looks up accusingly at RAMSAY, who mugs a reaction of shock."
10512,RAMSAY: What? No. Pork sausage. You think I'm some sort of savage?
10513,NARRATOR:THEON sulks.
10514,RAMSAY: People talk about phantom limbs. An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be. So I've always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock?
10515,NARRATOR:He holds up a pork sausage as a visual aid.
10516,"RAMSAY: Next time you think about naked girls, would you feel an itch?"
10517,NARRATOR:RAMSAY shakes the sausage. THEON winces and whimpers. He begins to weep. RAMSAY takes a bite.
10518,RAMSAY: Sorry. I shouldn't make jokes. My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples.
10519,THEON: (cries)
10520,RAMSAY: But my father taught me to aim for their head.
10521,THEON: Kill me.
10522,"RAMSAY: Sorry, what?"
10523,THEON: Kill me.
10524,RAMSAY: A little louder.
10525,THEON: Kill me!
10526,NARRATOR:THEON begins to sob.
10527,RAMSAY: You're no good to me dead. We need you.
10528,NARRATOR:RAMSAY rises from the table. He walks to THEON grabs THEON's hair and pulls his head back.
10529,"RAMSAY: You don't look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore. That's a name for a lord. But you're not a lord, are you? You're just meat."
10530,THEON: (groans)
10531,RAMSAY: Stinking meat.
10532,NARRATOR:RAMSAY sniffs THEON.
10533,RAMSAY: You reek. Reek! That's a good name for you. What's your name?
10534,THEON: Theon Greyjoy.
10535,NARRATOR:RAMSAY gives THEON a powerful slap.
10536,RAMSAY: What's your name?
10537,NARRATOR:RAMSAY punches THEON harder.
10538,THEON: Please.
10539,NARRATOR:RAMSAY grabs THEON's neck with both hands and throttles him.
10540,RAMSAY: What is your name?!
10541,THEON: Reek. My name is Reek.
10542,"NARRATOR:Satisfied and victorious, RAMSAY releases THEON and walks away. THEON weeps again."
10543,"INT: The North, the abandoned Nightfort, night"
10544,NARRATOR:The wind howls outside. A distant gasp startles BRAN awake.  Summer paces as the gasping continues.
10545,BRAN: Hodor.
10546,"NARRATOR:HODOR wakes. MEERA draws her knife reflexively as she jumps to consciousness. The gasps continue. Summer growls. Footsteps approach. A figure rises from the well, clanging and groaning. The huge figure enters through the trap door, which clangs shut behind him. MEERA yells and jumps the figure, pinning him to the ground, knife at his throat. It is SAM."
10547,SAM: Don't kill me!
10548,MEERA: Who are you?
10549,"NARRATOR:GILLY enters, frantic, holding her BABY."
10550,GILLY: Sam! Sam!
10551,MEERA: Who are you?!
10552,GILLY: Gilly. Don't hurt us.
10553,NARRATOR:MEERA releases SAM and he gets up from the floor.
10554,JOJEN: Where are you going?
10555,SAM: To Castle Black. I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.
10556,"BRAN: My brother, he's in the Night's--"
10557,JOJEN: Shush.
10558,SAM: Who's your brother?
10559,JOJEN: Doesn't matter.
10560,NARRATOR:Summer growls. SAM realizes that BRAN has a direwolf.
10561,SAM: You're Jon's brother. The one who fell from the window.
10562,"BRAN: No, I'm not."
10563,SAM: I've been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one. And I've heard all about Hodor.
10564,HODOR: Hodor.
10565,"SAM: I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon. If you're his brother, you're my brother, too. And anything I can do to help you, I will."
10566,BRAN: Take us north of the Wall.
10567,NARRATOR:MEERA sheaths her knife and goes to inspect the well.
10568,SAM: What? Why in the world would you want to go--
10569,BRAN: I don't want to. I have to.
10570,JOJEN: How did you get through the Wall?
10571,MEERA: Does the well lead to an underground river? Is that how you came here?
10572,SAM: Come with us. There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall. Hodor can carry you to the top. We'll walk straight to Castle Black.
10573,GILLY: Come with us. There's nothing north but death.
10574,"SAM: If Jon is alive, then Castle Black's where he'll be. It's the safest place for you."
10575,JOJEN: There's nowhere safe any longer. You know that.
10576,"SAM: What I know is what I saw. And if you saw it, too, you'd run the other way."
10577,JOJEN: You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead.
10578,SAM: How do you know all that?
10579,JOJEN: The Night's Watch can't stop them. The kings of Westeros and all their armies can't stop them.
10580,NARRATOR:Everyone is silent. Birds call in the distance. The BABY fusses.
10581,SAM: But you're going to stop them?
10582,"BRAN: Please, Sam. I have to go north. I have to."

10585,INT: The Pyke
10586,"NARRATOR:BALON sits at a cluttered table. YARA stands nearby. BALON opens a leather tube to reveal a scroll. He draws out the scroll, and recognizes the wax seal of the Flayed Man. He breaks the seal and unrolls the scroll."
10587,"BALON: 'Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North. I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shit-stained rocks you call a home."
10588,NARRATOR:YARA carefully unwraps the burlap and twine from around a package. Inside is a small chest. She frees the clasp.
10589,"NARRATOR:BALON stands as YARA opens the box. She is stonefaced. BALON joins her, and offers a similarly sober reaction.  He returns to reading the scroll."
10590,"BALON: 'Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon. Signed Ramsay Snow, natural-born son of Roose Bolton, Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North.' Get that out of my sight."
10591,NARRATOR:Yara looks at Balon.
10592,BALON: Theon disobeyed my orders.
10593,NARRATOR:Yara gives Balon a challenging look.
10594,"BALON: The boy is a fool. He cannot further the Greyjoy line. I will not give up the lands I have seized, the strongholds I have taken. Get this away from me."
10595,YARA: He's your son.
10596,BALON: Son? He's not a man anymore.
10597,YARA: He's your son. He's my brother. He's a Greyjoy.
10598,BALON: Watch yourself. I've made my decision.
10599,NARRATOR:BALON sits by the fire.
10600,YARA: And I've made mine. I'm going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet.
10601,CUT TO: YARA aboard an ironborn ship. The crew stands at attention as she walks past
10602,YARA: (voiceover)  I'm going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.

10608,BRAN: What is it?
10609,JOJEN: Dragonglass.
10610,SAM: We found them at the Fist. Someone buried them a long time ago. Someone wanted us to find them.
10611,"NARRATOR:Jojen takes a dragonglass knife from SAM, and inspects it."
10612,BRAN: Why? What are they for?
10613,NARRATOR:SAM and GILLY exchange a long look.
10614,SAM: Killing white walkers.
10615,MEERA: How do you know that?
10616,GILLY: The walker came for my Baby. And Sam--
10617,MEERA:  But no one's killed a white walker in thousands of years.
10618,"SAM: Well, I suppose someone had to be the first."
10619,"NARRATOR:SAM offers a dragonglass knife to HODOR, who refuses it. BRAN takes it and hands it him."
10620,"BRAN: Take it, Hodor."
10621,NARRATOR:HODOR looks at the remarkable knife. SAM hands dragonglass arrowheads to MEERA.
10622,"SAM: And the archer. I got lucky with one of them. There are more. Many more. And for every one of them, the dead men, more than you could count. I wish you'd come with us."

10627,DAVOS: How are you keeping?
10628,GENDRY: Great. Never better.
10629,DAVOS: It was just a bit of blood.
10630,"GENDRY: I should have known. Every time a highborn asks my name, it's trouble. We're not really people to you, are we? Just a million different ways to get what you want."
10631,DAVOS: I'm not a highborn.
10632,GENDRY: She called you Ser. I heard it.
10633,"NARRATOR:DAVOS sits down, mirroring GENDRY on the other side of the bars."
10634,DAVOS: A recent state of affairs. I was born in Flea Bottom just like you.
10635,"GENDRY: Sure, you were. You're my friend. You're here to help."
10636,DAVOS: I lived below the Street of Flour.
10637,GENDRY: How far below? How close to the Red Keep were you?
10638,DAVOS: The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill along Tanner's Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley.
10639,GENDRY: Gin Alley.
10640,"DAVOS: The Street of Steel, with your armor and your knights? Pfft. You lived in the fancy part of town. And here we are now. Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king."
10641,"GENDRY: Yeah, we've come a long way. We're all the same, really. She went to great pains to point that out to me."
10642,"DAVOS: If you mistrust fancy people so much, why were you in such a hurry to trust her?"
10643,"DAVOS: She does know her way around a man's head, I'll give her that."
10644,NARRATOR:They  both chuckle.
10645,GENDRY: So how'd you become a lord?
10646,"DAVOS: Oh, that's a long story."
10647,"GENDRY: Better not, then. I'm a bit busy."
10648,DAVOS: Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation. He rewarded me with a lordship. And this.
10649,NARRATOR:DAVOS shows GENDRY is half-fingers.
10650,GENDRY: You see? Highborns.
10651,DAVOS: I didn't want to be a lord. I nearly didn't accept.
10652,GENDRY: Why did you?
10653,DAVOS: I did it for my son. I didn't want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door. I wanted him to have a better life.
10654,GENDRY: Does he?
10655,DAVOS: He's dead.
10656,NARRATOR:DAVOS stands up.

10663,SHAE: When I was 13.
10664,VARYS: You were only a child.
10665,SHAE: I stopped being a child when I was nine. My mother made sure of that.
10666,"VARYS: You've been a good influence on our mutual friend, you know. He used to drink from sundown to sunup, visit three brothels a night, gamble away his father's money. Now it's just the drinking."
10667,SHAE: And now I'm his wife's servant. I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot.
10668,VARYS: She is a sweet young thing. None of this is her fault.
10669,SHAE: I love that girl. I would kill for her. Do you think that makes it easier for me?
10670,"VARYS: No, I expect not."
10671,SHAE: She's young and she's beautiful and highborn.
10672,"VARYS: We break bread with them, but that doesn't make us family. We've learned their language, but we'll never be their countrymen. If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister--"
10673,SHAE: I have a name.
10674,VARYS: You have one name. As do I. Here only the family name matters.
10675,"SHAE: What do you want from me, Lord Varys?"
10676,NARRATOR:Varys hands Shae a small bag of diamonds.
10677,"VARYS: Diamonds. I'd tell you to beware carrying so much wealth, but you know how to protect yourself. Get on one of those ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr. You can buy a house with these diamonds, a very large house. Hire servants. Start a new life, a good life, far from here. The mysterious foreign beauty. You'll have suitors lining up."
10678,SHAE: Why do you want me to leave?
10679,NARRATOR:VARYS moves to leave

10699,TYRION: Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit?
10700,CERSEI: I won't be marrying Ser Loras.
10701,TYRION: I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage.
10702,CERSEI: You're not me. You want to make things better for Sansa? Give her a child.
10703,TYRION: So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it?
10704,CERSEI: So she can have some happiness in her life.
10705,TYRION: You have children. How happy would you say you are?
10706,"CERSEI: Not very. But if it weren't for my children, I'd have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep. They're the reason I'm alive."
10707,TYRION: Even Joffrey?
10708,NARRATOR:CERSEI sits.

10805,MELISANDRE: I take no credit. I have faith and my faith has been rewarded.
10806,"DAVOS: Your Grace, the world has got so far bent. I've seen things crawl out of nightmares, but my eyes were open. I don't know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Woman's sorcery or because at war men die all the time, but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong. It is evil. And you are not an evil man."

10808,DAVOS: Aegon Targaryen.
10809,STANNIS: And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros?
10810,DAVOS: On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread.
10811,"STANNIS: He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army, but he had three dragons. Dragons are magic, Ser Davos. My enemies have made my kingdom bleed. I will not forget that. I will not forgive that. I will punish them with any arms at my disposal."
10812,"DAVOS: You do not need to burn the boy. If what you say is true, a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark--"

10979,CATELYN: Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest?
10980,NARRATOR:ROBB does not answer.
10981,CATELYN: Something else?
10982,"ROBB: By the time Bolton's bastard-RAMSAY got to Winterfell, the ironborn were gone. They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch. And BRAN and RICKON have not been found. They may have escaped. Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages."
10983,CATELYN: Have you received any demands?
10984,ROBB: No.
10985,CATELYN: Have you heard anything from Theon at all?
10986,INT: Dungeon
10987,"NARRATOR:THEON is bound on an X-shaped cross in a dungeon. Someone drenches him with a bucket of water to wake him. He wakes, shaking, and takes stock of his location. A blurry TORTURER looks on."
10988,THEON: Where am I? Who are you? What do you want?
10989,"NARRATOR:The TORTURER approaches and grabs THEON's hand, roughly."
10990,TORTURER: I want to do this.
10991,NARRATOR:The TORTURER thrusts an awl under THEON's finger nail. THEON screams in pain.
10992,EXT: A field in the Riverlands
10993,"NARRATOR:JAIME and BRIENNE make their way through a hedge. JAIME's hands are bound, and BRIENNE has him leashed."
10994,JAIME: Do you know how long it's going to take us to get to King's Landing walking through fields and forests?
10995,BRIENNE: Yes.
10996,NARRATOR:They walk through the field. BRIENNE occassionally pushes JAIME forward.
10997,JAIME: So how shall we pass the time?
10998,BRIENNE: By putting one foot in front of the other.
10999,JAIME: It's going to be a very dull walk.
11000,BRIENNE: I'm here to take you to King's Landing and bring back Lady Stark's daughters in exchange. Dull is fine.
11001,"JAIME: You know, it doesn't matter how loyal a servant you are, no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute. Trust me on this. People have been serving me since I was born. You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life? A week's journey with you and she'll order you to fall on your sword."
11002,"BRIENNE: If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service, I'm sure she'll let me know. She's an honest woman."
11003,JAIME: All the good it's done her.
11004,"EXT: Riverlands forrest, a bit later."
11005,"NARRATOR:JAIME relieves himself on a tree, while BRIENNE looks on."
11006,JAIME: How did you come into Lady Stark's service? There's something we can talk about.
11007,"BRIENNE: Not your concern, Kingslayer."
11008,JAIME: It had to be recently. You weren't with her at Winterfell.
11009,BRIENNE: How would you know?
11010,JAIME: Because I visited Winterfell. I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways.
11011,NARRATOR:She yanks on his leash and they move on.
11012,BRIENNE: Move.
11013,JAIME: Were you pledged to Stannis?
11014,"BRIENNE: Gods, no."
11015,"JAIME: Ah, Renly. Really? He wasn't fit to rule over anything more important than a 12-course meal."
11016,BRIENNE: Shut your mouth.
11017,"JAIME: Why? I lived with him at court since he was a boy, don't forget. Could hardly escape the little tulip. Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks. I knew him far better than you."
11018,"BRIENNE: I knew him as well as anyone. As a member of his Kingsguard, he trusted me with everything. He would have been a wonderful king."
11019,JAIME: Sounds like you quite fancied him.
11020,BRIENNE: I did not fancy him.
11021,"JAIME: Oh, gods, you did."
11022,"JAIME: Did you ever tell him? No, of course not. You weren't Renly's type, I'm afraid."
11023,NARRATOR:BRIENNE yanks on his leash in response.
11024,JAIME: He preferred curly-haired little girls like Loras Tyrell. You're far too much man for him.
11025,BRIENNE: I'm not interested in foul rumors.
11026,JAIME: Unless they're about me. It's all true about Renly. His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court. It's a shame the throne isn't made out of cocks. They'd have never got him off it.
11027,NARRATOR:BRIENNE grabs the back of JAIME's head and yanks roughly. She puts her face directly in his.
11028,BRIENNE: Shut your mouth!
11029,"JAIME: I don't blame him. And I don't blame you, either. We don't get to choose who we love."
11030,"NARRATOR:A man approaches, leading  a horse."
11031,"MAN: Where are you headed, then?"
11032,BRIENNE: South. You?
11033,"MAN: Riverrun. Staying off the kingsroad, are you? They get you no matter where you go. You can't win."
11034,"JAIME: No, you really can't."
11035,"NARRATOR:They both laugh, kindly."
11036,"MAN: Looks like you're safe enough, though. Meaning no offense, my lady, but I wouldn't tangle with you. Seven blessings to you."
11037,BRIENNE: And you.
11038,"NARRATOR:The man starts to walk away, but looks back over his shoulder."
11039,JAIME: He knows who I am.
11040,BRIENNE: He doesn't.
11041,JAIME: Maybe you're right.  But what if you're not? What if he tells someone?
11042,BRIENNE: We're not doing it. He's an innocent man.
11043,JAIME: More innocent than Lady Stark's daughters?
11044,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE pushes JAIME forward, and leads him further along in the woods."
11045,"INT: King's Landing, Joffrey's Chambers"
11046,"NARRATOR:Joffrey is being fitted by a TAILOR. CERSEI, seated nearby, looks on."
11047,JOFFREY:  Make it tighter here.
11048,CERSEI: That's better. It makes you look very strong.
11049,"NARRATOR:The TAILOR lays some sample fabric on Joffrey's shoulder. Displeased, Joffrey snatches it away."
11050,JOFFREY: No flowers. I said no flowers. All these are wrong. Bring others.
11051,NARRATOR:JOFFREY dismisses the TAILOR.
11052,"TAILOR: Yes, Your Grace."
11053,NARRATOR:The TAILOR exits.
11054,JOFFREY: Bloody flowers. On the king.
11055,CERSEI: Looks like a Tyrell rose. Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown. Should be more than enough fabric.
11056,NARRATOR:Joffrey tosses the fabric away and moves to his bed to change back into his clothes.
11057,CERSEI: Tell me what you think of her.
11058,JOFFREY: Who?
11059,CERSEI: Margaery.
11060,"JOFFREY: She's an ideal match. With the Tyrells beside us, we'll crush the Northerners. Hang their lords, burn their strongholds, sow their fields with salt, and no one will think of rebelling for another century."
11061,"CERSEI: It is a good match, but what do you think of her? She's beautiful and intelligent."
11062,"JOFFREY: Yes, she is."
11063,CERSEI: Her concern with the well-being of the common people is interesting.
11064,JOFFREY: Not to me.
11065,CERSEI: I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself.
11066,JOFFREY: This is becoming one of the most boring conversations I've ever had.
11067,NARRATOR:CERSEI stands.
11068,CERSEI: Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason. She dresses like a harlot for a reason. She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason.
11069,JOFFREY: She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to. That's what intelligent women do-what they're told.
11070,"NARRATOR:CERSEI reaches out to him, but JOFFREY pushes her hand away."
11071,CERSEI: You need to ask yourself
11072,JOFFREY: I don't need to do anything.
11073,NARRATOR:The TAILOR returns with a different fabric sample. He drapes it on JOFFREY's shoulder.
11074,JOFFREY: Better. Much better.
11075,INT: Sansa's room in King's Landing
11076,NARRATOR:SHAE brushes SANSA's hair as SANSA sits before a mirror.
11077,SHAE: I still don't believe it.
11078,SANSA: He didn't. He didn't want anything. He just takes an interest because he loved my mother.
11079,SHAE: Men only want one thing from a pretty girl.
11080,SANSA: Littlefinger's not in love with me.
11081,NARRATOR:SHAE helps SANSA into her dress.
11082,SHAE: Love is not the thing he wants.
11083,SANSA: He's too old.
11084,SHAE: They never see it that way. He didn't ask you to do something for him? Spy on someone or?
11085,SANSA: No.
11086,"SHAE: If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you, I want you to tell me."
11087,SANSA: Why? What will you do? I will make him stop.
11088,NARRATOR:There is a knock on the door.
11089,"GUARD: Ser Loras Tyrell, my lady."
11090,SANSA: Send him in.
11091,NARRATOR:SHAE opens the door and LORAS enters.
11092,LORAS: Lady Sansa.
11093,SANSA: Ser Loras.
11094,LORAS: My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens. May I escort you to them?
11095,"NARRATOR:SANSA exits with LORAS, while SHAE watches with concern."
11096,EXT: King's Landing garden
11097,"NARRATOR:SANSA and LORAS stroll together through the garden, her arm in his."
11098,"LORAS:  I believe you grow more beautiful every day, Lady Sansa."
11099,"SANSA: You are too kind, Ser Loras. You probably don't remember the first time we met. At the Hand's tourney, you gave me your favor. A rose, a red rose."
11100,LORAS: Of course I did.
11101,NARRATOR:They approach MARGAERY.
11102,MARGAERY: (to a maid)  It's more your color. You take it.
11103,MAID: Thank you.
11104,MARGAERY: (to LORAS) You're such a dear.
11105,LORAS: I'll take my leave. Lady Sansa.
11106,"SANSA: Thank you, Ser Loras."
11107,"NARRATOR:LORAS exits. MARGAERY leads SANSA to a patio, filled with maids."
11108,"MARGAERY: Come. Lady Sansa, it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell."
11109,"NARRATOR:They walk to Olenna, who is seated in the patio."
11110,"OLENNA: Kiss me, child."
11111,"NARRATOR:Olenna extends her hand, and SANSA kisses it in greeting."
11112,OLENNA: It's so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens. We're very sorry for your losses.
11113,"SANSA: And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renly's death, Lady Margaery. He was very gallant."
11114,"OLENNA: Gallant, yes. And charming and very clean. He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king."
11115,"MARGAERY: Renly was brave and gentle, Grandmother. Father liked him and so did Loras."
11116,OLENNA: Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick. That does not make him wise. As to your fathead father-
11117,MARGAERY: Grandmother! What will Sansa think of us?
11118,"OLENNA: She might think we have some wits about us. One of us, at any rate. It was treason. I warned them. Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother. How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair? We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me. But once the cow's been milked, there's no squirting the cream back up her udders. So here we are to see things through. What do you say to that, Sansa? Shall we have some lemon cakes?"
11119,SANSA: Lemon cake's my favorite.
11120,"OLENNA: So we've been told. (To the SERVANT) Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death? Here, Sansa, come sit with me. I'm much less boring than these others."
11121,NARRATOR:They move to a table away from the others.
11122,OLENNA: Do you know my son? The Lord of Highgarden?
11123,SANSA: I haven't had the pleasure.
11124,"OLENNA: No great pleasure, believe me. A ponderous oaf. His father was an oaf as well. My husband, the late Lord Luthor. He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking. They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him. And now my son is doing the same, only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse. Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy, this Joffrey."
11125,"SANSA: I--, I--"
11126,"OLENNA: You, you. Who else would know better? We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them? Has this boy mistreated you?"
11127,NARRATOR:SANSA looks down and doesn't reply.
11128,OLENNA: Has he ripped out your tongue?
11129,"SANSA:  Joff-King Joffrey, he-His Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion"
11130,"OLENNA: Yes, all Lannisters are lions. And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose. But how kind is he? How clever? Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?"
11131,MARGAERY:  I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means.
11132,NARRATOR:A SERVANT approaches and brings a platter.
11133,OLENNA: Bring me some cheese.
11134,"SERVANT: The cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady."
11135,OLENNA: The cheese will be served when I want it served. And I want it served now.
11136,NARRATOR:The SERVANT nods and exits quickly.
11137,"OLENNA: Are you frightened, child? No need for that. We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you."
11138,SANSA: My father always told the truth.
11139,"OLENNA: Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head."
11140,SANSA: Joffrey. Joffrey did that. He promised he would be merciful and he cut my father's head off. And he said that was mercy. Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it.
11141,NARRATOR:SANSA holds back tears.
11142,OLENNA: Go on.
11143,NARRATOR:SANSA regains her compsure.
11144,SANSA: I-I can't. I never meant-my father was a traitor. My brother as well. I have traitor's blood. Please don't make me say anymore.
11145,"MARGAERY: She's terrified, Grandmother. Just look at her."
11146,"OLENNA: Speak freely, child. We would never betray your confidence, I swear it."
11147,SANSA: He's a monster.
11148,OLENNA: Ah. That's a pity.
11149,"SANSA: Please, don't stop the wedding."
11150,"OLENNA: Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen. Even so, we thank you for the truth. Ah, here comes my cheese."
11151,NARRATOR:The SERVANT sets down the tray and slips away. SANSA sighs in resignation.
11152,EXT: Riverlands Woods
11153,NARRATOR:ROBB's forces move along a path through the woods. The direwolf Grey Wind watches as RICKARD KARSTARK and ROBB watch the men march past.
11154,RICKARD KARSTARK: We're at war. This march is a distraction.
11155,ROBB: My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction.  RICKARD KARSTARK: Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?
11156,ROBB: No.  RICKARD KARSTARK: Then it's a distraction.
11157,"ROBB: My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there. We need his men.  RICKARD KARSTARK: Unless he's been breeding them, he don't have enough to make a difference."
11158,"ROBB: Have you lost faith in our cause?   RICKARD KARSTARK:  If it's revenge, I still got faith in it."
11159,"ROBB: You don't think we can win?  RICKARD KARSTARK:  May I speak my mind, Your Grace?"
11160,"ROBB:  Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?  RICKARD KARSTARK:  I think you lost this war the day you married her."
11161,NARRATOR:TALISA rides past.
11162,EXT: A bit further up the path
11163,"NARRATOR:CATELYN weaves a wooden circle bound with twine . TALISA rides up and dismounts with the help of a soldier, her mount whinnying."
11164,"TALISA: Whoa, whoa."
11165,MAN: Your Grace.
11166,CATELYN: You're afraid of her. And she knows it.
11167,"TALISA: I'm not afraid of her. May I help you, Lady Stark?"
11168,CATELYN: No.
11169,"TALISA: I'm sorry, I shouldn't have-"
11170,CATELYN: You can't help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them. Only a mother can make them.
11171,TALISA: You've made them before?
11172,NARRATOR:TALISA sits.
11173,CATELYN:  Twice.
11174,TALISA: Did they work?
11175,CATELYN:  After a fashion. I prayed for my son  Bran to survive his fall.
11176,TALISA: (Nods.)
11177,"CATELYN: Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox. Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live. But it would be a very long night. So I sat with him all through the darkness. Listened to his ragged little breaths, his coughing, his whimpering."
11178,TALISA: Which boy?
11179,"CATELYN: Jon Snow. When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him. I didn't want to see those brown stranger's eyes staring up at me. So I prayed to the gods, take him away. Make him die. He got the pox. And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived. A murderer. I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother. A woman he didn't even know. So I prayed to all seven gods, let the boy live. Let him live and I'll love him. I'll be a mother to him. I'll beg my husband to give him a true name, to call him Stark and be done with it, to make him one of us."
11180,TALISA: And he lived.
11181,CATELYN: And he lived. And I couldn't keep my promise. And everything that's happened since then all this horror that's come to my family it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child.

11189,JON:  You want to protect your people.
11190,"MANCE: Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans, half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another? They speak seven different languages in my army. The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans. Everyone hates the cave people. So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army?"
11191,JON: No.

11263,ARYA: Would you please shut up about it?
11264,GENDRY: Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills.
11265,ARYA: I'm not listening.
11266,GENDRY: But just explain it to me. He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead. All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone. You could have picked King Joffrey.
11267,ARYA: Shut up.
11268,GENDRY: You could have picked Tywin Lannister.
11269,"ARYA: Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?"
11270,GENDRY: But you could have ended the war.
11271,ARYA: Where are we going?
11272,GENDRY: North.
11273,NARRATOR:They pause in the woods.
11274,"ARYA: If we were going north, we should have come to the Red Fork River by now."
11275,GENDRY: Maybe we already passed it.
11276,"ARYA: It's 100 feet wide. How could we have passed it? If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun. My mother grew up there. My grandfather he's a lord. He'll protect us."
11277,NARRATOR:They hear some far-away singing.
11278,GENDRY: Could be a minstrel.
11279,ARYA: Shut up.
11280,"THOROS: A lion still has claws  HOT PIE:  A minstrel's got gold sometimes. We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food."
11281,ARYA: Shh.
11282,"NARRATOR:They crouch to hide behind a broken wall, and watch a handful of men approach. One is singing."
11283,"THOROS: And so he spoke, and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains Weep o'er his hall With no one there to hear."
11284,"NARRATOR:An arrow whistles past the trio, surprising them. It embeds in a tree trunk behind them. They spin to hide out of sight."
11285,THOROS: What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?
11286,"ANGUY:  Just a dirty little cub, I think."
11287,THOROS: Loose a few more shafts.
11288,NARRATOR:ARYA steps out of hiding.
11289,ARYA: Don't.
11290,NARRATOR:THOROS and ANGUY look down at her from the path. THOROS takes a deep drink.
11291,"THOROS: Put the sword down, girl."
11292,ARYA: You go on down the road. Just keep on singing so we know where you are. Leave us be and I won't kill you.
11293,ANGUY: Generous.
11294,THOROS: You're a dangerous person. I like dangerous people. Why are your friends so shy?
11295,ARYA: What friends?
11296,ANGUY:  The fat to your left and the lad beside him.
11297,"NARRATOR:Resigned, GENDRY steps out and pulls HOT PIE with him. They ready their weapons. THOROS responds, and his party swiftly comes over the wall to face the trio. They do not draw weapons."
11298,THOROS: Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords. You escape from Harrenhal?
11299,ARYA: Who are you?
11300,THOROS: Thoros of Myr. And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy.
11301,"ARYA: No, who do you fight for?"
11302,THOROS:  The Brotherhood without Banners. Now come along. I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal.
11303,HOT PIE: I'm not going with them. The Brotherhood? That's who the Mountain and them lot were looking for. They'll bring us back and put rats in us.
11304,"THOROS: You've got nothing to fear from us, son. The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside. We're trying to save it. Now come on. We'll talk some more over brown bread and stew. And then you can go on your way."
11305,"NARRATOR:HOT PIE takes a few steps back. ANGUY notches an arrow in response. ARYA, GENDRY and HOT PIE raise their weapons, nervously."
11306,"ANGUY: Here's the thing, fat"
11307,NARRATOR:ANGUY shoots the arrow into the sky.
11308,"ANGUY: When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head. So I advise you move, because I'm done talking."
11309,"NARRATOR:HOT PIE lurches forward two steps. The arrow lands, burying itself where HOT PIE was just standing. THOROS motions for the trio to move with them. Some men chuckle, and then everyone scrambles over the broken wall in turn."
11310,ANGUY: Half the country's starving and look at this one.
11311,THOROS: Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving.
11312,"NARRATOR:THOROS follows HOT PIE. ANGUY, pulls his arrow from the tree trunk."
11313,INT: Tyrion's Chambers in King's Landing
11314,NARRATOR:TYRION returns to his quarters. SHAE lies waiting for him.
11315,SHAE: My lion.
11316,TYRION: We've spoken of this. You cannot come here.
11317,NARRATOR:They kiss.
11318,SHAE: But you said I should come to you with any problems.
11319,TYRION: Did anyone see you? No.
11320,SHAE: No.
11321,TYRION: You sure? My father does not make idle threats. Having you killed would be the high point of his week. You have to be absolutely certain.
11322,NARRATOR:They kiss again.
11323,TYRION: All right. What is this problem?
11324,"SHAE:  I'm worried about Sansa. When she spoke with Lord Baelish, his friend warned me about him."
11325,TYRION: Baelish doesn't have friends.
11326,SHAE: I don't know her name.
11327,"TYRION: Oh, Ros? The redhead?"
11328,SHAE: How do you know her?
11329,TYRION: I try to know as many people as I can. You never know which one you'll need.
11330,SHAE: She's a whore.
11331,"TYRION: Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgmental about these things."
11332,SHAE: You fucked her.
11333,"TYRION: Oh, please. All right, yes, I fucked her once. Twice."
11334,"NARRATOR:SHAE slaps at his chest, playful, and stands up to walk from the bed to pout."
11335,"TYRION: But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else."
11336,SHAE: And was she good? Did you like her?
11337,"TYRION: Not as much as I like you, obviously, or she'd be the one torturing me right now. What did she say about Littlefinger?"
11338,SHAE: That Sansa shouldn't trust him.
11339,TYRION: Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?
11340,SHAE: We have to protect her.
11341,NARRATOR:SHAE begins to pet him with affection.
11342,"TYRION: We can't. Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors. A great beauty with a very old name."
11343,NARRATOR:SHAE pushes him again.
11344,"SHAE: A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?"
11345,"TYRION: Yes, she is, objectively, very. Her face is quite pleasing-to other men and to women, people in general. But not to me, of course. I only have eyes for you."
11346,SHAE: You pervert. You want her? This child?
11347,TYRION:  I don't even want to talk about her.
11348,SHAE: But you are.
11349,TYRION: Only because you're making me.
11350,NARRATOR:SHAE grabs his chin and looks directly at him.
11351,SHAE: I didn't force you to open your mouth and make words come out.
11352,TYRION: This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair.
11353,"SHAE: Oh, the cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me."
11354,"TYRION: Hmm, yes."
11355,NARRATOR:They kiss.
11356,SHAE: Now do you think I'm cruel?
11357,NARRATOR:She begins to undress him.
11358,TYRION: Only if you stop. But you mustn't come here again.
11359,"NARRATOR:She kisses him,  loosens his cloths, and kisses him lower."
11360,TYRION: Do you hear me? You've come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people. Dangerous people.
11361,EXT: King's Landing Courtyard
11362,"NARRATOR:MARGAERY walks through the courtyard, accompanied by guards."
11363,INT: Joffrey's Chambers in King's Landing
11364,NARRATOR:JOFFREY sits holding his crossbow. A guard knocks on the door.
11365,"GUARD: Lady Tyrell, my king."
11366,JOFFREY: Send her in.
11367,"NARRATOR:The door opens, and MARGAERY enters."
11368,"MARGAERY: You wanted to see me, Your Grace?"
11369,JOFFREY:  I'm leaving on a hunting trip. I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left.
11370,"MARGAERY: That's very thoughtful, Your Grace. I have everything I could want."
11371,JOFFREY: Good. Good. How are you finding life in the capital? It must be quite a change after Renly's camp.
11372,NARRATOR:She approaches.
11373,MARGAERY: A welcome one. A military encampment is no place for a lady.
11374,JOFFREY: And the bedside of a traitor? Is that a place for a lady?
11375,"MARGAERY: Your Grace, I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all."
11376,JOFFREY: What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?
11377,MARGAERY: The duty of any wife to any husband-to provide him with children.
11378,JOFFREY: You failed to do this.
11379,"MARGAERY: Why? I-I would not speak ill of the dead, Your Grace."
11380,JOFFREY: You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because he's had a sword put through his heart?
11381,MARGAERY: No. I do beg your pardon. The subtleties of politics are often lost on me. Renly I don't believe he was interested in the company of women.
11382,JOFFREY: What makes you say this?
11383,NARRATOR:MARGAERY sits next to JOFFREY.
11384,"MARGAERY: Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he-he had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils. He never wanted to try. Except one evening, after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something-something that sounded very painful and couldn't possibly result in children. Maybe the fault was with me."
11385,"JOFFREY: No, he was a known degenerate."
11386,"MARGAERY: It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace."
11387,JOFFREY: Mmm. I've considered making his perversion punishable by death.
11388,MARGAERY: As is your right. You must do whatever you need to do.
11389,NARRATOR:MARGAERY strokes the crossbow.
11390,MARGAERY: You are the king.
11391,JOFFREY: Yes. I am.
11392,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY looks at his crossbow, a bit excited."
11393,JOFFREY: Do you like it? I just had it made. Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms.
11394,MARGAERY: It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?
11395,JOFFREY:  It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank. You use this lever to draw the string.
11396,NARRATOR:JOFFREY uses the lever to cock the bow.
11397,JOFFREY: The bolt goes here.
11398,"NARRATOR:MARGAERY hands him the bolt, daintily. He takes it and arms the bow. He stands, weapon braced at his waist, and looks for a target."
11399,JOFFREY: And then you just aim and
11400,NARRATOR:JOFFREY releases the bolt and pierces the head of a stuffed boar. MARGAERY erupts in applause and laughs. She stands.
11401,"MARGAERY: Would you take me hunting sometime? Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman."
11402,JOFFREY: It's not unheard of.
11403,MARGAERY:  May I? Please.
11404,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY hands her the crossbow, and helps MARGAERY into a proper stance. They stand, posed and close."
11405,MARGAERY: I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there.
11406,JOFFREY: Could you do it? Could you kill something?.
11407,"MARGAERY:  I don't know, Your Grace Do you think I could?"
11408,JOFFREY: Yes.
11409,MARGAERY: Would you like to watch me?
11410,JOFFREY: Yes.

11413,THEON: Stop! Stop!
11414,TORTURER: Tell us the truth.
11415,THEON: (screaming) About what?
11416,NARRATOR:The ASSISTANT turns the screw again.
11417,THEON: I don't know what you want.
11418,TORTURER: I want the truth.
11419,THEON: What truth?
11420,TORTURER: Why'd you take Winterfell?
11421,THEON: I took it to-I took it-
11422,TORTURER: Who gave the orders?
11423,THEON: No one. I took it on my own.
11424,TORTURER: Why?
11425,THEON: To take the North while it was vulnerable.
11426,TORTURER: What were you going to do once you took it?
11427,THEON: Hold it. Rule it.
11428,TORTURER: Good. That's very good.
11429,NARRATOR:The ASSISTANT turns the screw again. Blood well ups around it as THEON screams.
11430,THEON: Why did you do that?
11431,TORTURER:  I told you. Why did you take Winterfell?
11432,THEON:  I took it to bring glory to my house and my father.
11433,NARRATOR:The TORTURER approaches.
11434,"THEON: (panicking) Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks. I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them."
11435,NARRATOR:The TORTURER steps even closer.
11436,THEON: What are you doing?
11437,NARRATOR:The TORTURER places a hood over THEON's head.
11438,THEON: Please.
11439,"NARRATOR:The ASSISTANT turns the screw, and THEON screams. The TORTURER walks away, followed by his team. They leave one lowly cleaning boy, RAMSAY, behind."
11440,"THEON: I'll tell you anything. Just take it off. Please. Please, just take it off."
11441,NARRATOR:The door closes shut. RAMSAY removes the hood from THEON. He is surprised.
11442,RAMSAY: Your sister sent me.
11443,THEON: Yara?
11444,NARRATOR:RAMSAY releases the pressure on his foot.
11445,RAMSAY: I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps.
11446,"NARRATOR:RAMSAY places the hood back onto THEON's head, and leaves."
11447,"THEON: No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me. Please, please. Please, please don't go! Please. Please. Don't leave me. Please don't go."
11448,EXT: The North
11449,"NARRATOR:HODOR, RICKON, OSHA, Jojan and MEERA walk along a narrow road. HODOR pulls the cart carrying BRAN. The direwolves are nearby. RICKON, runs excitedly down the hill."
11450,"OSHA: Rickon, stay with us."
11451,BRAN: It's all right. The wolves will protect him.
11452,"NARRATOR:BRAN nods to Summer, who turns to follow RICKON. They continue on the path."
11453,"JOJEN: You can get inside his head, see through his eyes."
11454,BRAN: Only when I'm asleep.
11455,JOJEN: That's how it begins until you learn to control it. You're a warg.
11456,BRAN: It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a-
11457,JOJEN: A three-eyed raven?
11458,BRAN: You've seen it?
11459,JOJEN:  We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?
11460,BRAN: Does it have anything to do with warging?
11461,"JOJEN:  No, the raven is something different, something deeper. The raven brings the sight."
11462,BRAN: Seeing things that haven't happened yet?
11463,JOJEN:  Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away.
11464,OSHA: What's he telling him?
11465,MEERA: Why don't you ask?
11466,"OSHA:  Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?"
11467,MEERA: Where's the shame in that?
11468,OSHA: Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting.
11469,MEERA: Some people will always need help. That doesn't mean they're not worth helping.
11470,"BRAN: When my father died, I dreamt it."
11471,JOJEN: You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I.
11472,"BRAN: You have the sight, too?"
11473,"JOJEN: (Nods.) When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life, I saw him cry."
11474,BRAN: Your father is Howland Reed? Yeah.
11475,JOJEN: Yeah.
11476,BRAN: He saved my father's life during the rebellion.
11477,"JOJEN: Your father told you about the rebellion? Mine never did. But I saw that, too."
11478,BRAN: What else have you seen?
11479,JOJEN:  Only one thing that matters-you.
11480,EXT: Riverlands Tavern
11481,NARRATOR:The tavern is lively with  drinking and laughing
11482,"MAN: I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle. Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again, you understand."
11483,"NARRATOR:Nearby, THOROS sits with ARYA, GENDRY and HOT PIE. He pours some ale for ARYA."
11484,ARYA: I don't drink ale.
11485,THOROS: There's no story so good a drink won't make it better.
11486,MAN: Yeah!
11487,"THOROS: You see? They've all suffered through my bouts of sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned. Now, how did three children-"
11488,ARYA: We're not children.
11489,"THOROS: How did three young persons such as yourselves, untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?"
11490,ARYA: Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armory.
11491,"THOROS: A smith, eh? Where'd you train?"
11492,GENDRY: King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop.
11493,THOROS: That criminal. He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city.
11494,GENDRY: That's because he's twice as good.
11495,THOROS: Aha! A smith and a salesman.
11496,ARYA: Gendry stole us weapons.
11497,"THOROS: Ah, fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see."
11498,ARYA: He knows how to use a sword and so do I.
11499,NARRATOR:The men laugh.
11500,ARYA: My brothers taught me.
11501,NARRATOR:The men laugh again. ARYA stands to prove herself. She draws her sword and points it at THOROS's throat.
11502,MEN: Ooh!
11503,"NARRATOR:THOROS looks at the blade, and feints a drink. Instead, he rises, draws his sword and disarms ARYA with a sweeping move of his blade. Surprised, ARYA steps backward, afraid. The men cheer. THOROS takes some dramatic and slightly drunken steps, then relents. He turns to rejoin the table, taking up some ale along the way."
11504,THOROS: To your brothers!
11505,"NARRATOR:The men cheer. ARYA meekly picks up her weapon and sits back down at the table, next to the silent GENDRY and HOT PIE."
11506,THOROS: You can finish your meals before you go. It may be awhile before you see another.
11507,ARYA: You'll free us?
11508,THOROS: I gave you my word.
11509,"NARRATOR:The trio rises. So does THOROS.  But before you go, allow me to raise a cup to your-"
11510,"NARRATOR:THOROS is interrupted by the smiling entrance of ANGUY and more brothers, with a large hooded captive. They are proud of their capture."
11511,"ANGUY : Hey, hey."
11512,NARRATOR:The men cheer.
11513,THOROS: Now that is an uncommonly large person. How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?
11514,ANGUY: One waits for him to drink until he passes out.
11515,THOROS: Poor man. You have my sympathy.
11516,"NARRATOR:He removes the hood. The captive is the HOUND. ARYA is worried, and turns away before she can be seen."
11517,"THOROS: Aha, not a man at all. A Hound!"
11518,NARRATOR:The men howl in jest.
11519,"THOROS: So good to see you again, Clegane."
11520,HOUND: Thoros? The fuck you doing here?
11521,THOROS: Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever.

11529,EXT: Riverlands
11530,NARRATOR:JAIME and BRIENNE walk along a river and approach a stone bridge.
11531,JAIME:  It's a tough decision-take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water.
11532,"BRIENNE: Silence, Kingslayer."
11533,"JAIME: Anyone can see us on the bridge, but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river."
11534,BRIENNE: Good luck.
11535,JAIME: It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas. Which will she choose?
11536,CUT TO: The bridge.
11537,NARRATOR:BRIENNE and JAIME have chosen the bridge.
11538,JAIME: Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed.
11539,BRIENNE: Be quick about it.
11540,"NARRATOR:When they reach the middle of the bridge, JAIME sits down, back to the wall."
11541,JAIME: I need to rest.
11542,BRIENNE: Get up.
11543,"JAIME: I have these, you know, on your feet when you walk too far. What do you call them?"
11544,BRIENNE: Get up now.
11545,"NARRATOR:She looks around, feeling nervous and exposed."
11546,"JAIME: Corns. I never used to get corns. Of course I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year."
11547,NARRATOR:BRIENNE tires of his ploy. He grabs him and tries to make JAIME stand back up.
11548,JAIME: This heel is ruined. There's no way-
11549,"NARRATOR:JAIME takes his opportunity and grabs BRIENNE's sword from its sheath. He runs as far as he can before the rope stops him. He cuts it with the sword. His hands are still bound, but he measures the feel of the sword, and chuckles."
11550,JAIME:  I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords.
11551,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE takes an aggressive stance. JAIME is playful and cavalier, trying to goad BRIENNE into making an ill-conceived move. She remains conservative in her tactics. They take stock of one another."
11552,JAIME: Ooh. You move well for a great beast of a woman.
11553,NARRATOR:JAIME begins an attack. Their sword clash.
11554,JAIME: You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game.
11555,"NARRATOR:JAIME lunges again and pushes BRIENNE back. She counters, but he regains momentum. In a spinning move, they switch places."
11556,"JAIME: Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark. But if you don't kill me, I'm going to kill you."
11557,NARRATOR:He attacks again. They end with their swords in contest and switch to a game of strength and leverage.
11558,"JAIME: You're good. Graceless, but good."
11559,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE uses her hilt to break the deadlock with an upward thrust of her sword. They face off again. This time, BRIENNE goes on the attack. She gains the advantage, and knees him in the stomach."
11560,"JAIME: See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there."
11561,"NARRATOR:JAIME spins to increase the force of his attacking blow, and drives BRIENNE back down the bridge. Their shouldersa collide and they face off once again, panting heavily. JAIME starts a new assault, but BRIENNE parries and gains the upper hand. She punches him in the jaw and he reels to the bridge wall. BRIENNE's next blow misses, but ignites sparks on the wall. BRIENNE grows stronger and confident as JAIME is beaten. Exhausted, he ends up on the ground. A horse neighs just off the bridge, and BRIENNE looks to locate who has joined them. Three mounted men ride out from the woods, with additional forces behind."
11562,"LOCKE: Looks like your woman's getting the better of you, if you can call that a woman."
11563,JAIME: We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing. The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste.
11564,LOCKE: You sure he's the one?
11565,NARRATOR:The MAN that JAIME and BRIENNE encountered in the woods  is brought forth.
11566,"MAN:  That's him, all right. I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding."
11567,LOCKE: Give the man his silver.
11568,JAIME: Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want.
11569,"LOCKE: Enough to buy me a new head? If the King in the North hears I had the Kingslayer and let him go, he'll be taking it right off. I'd rather he takes yours."
11570,"NARRATOR:The mounted men move forward onto the bridge. BRIENNE and JAIME step backward, with no options available to hold off such numbers."

11572,"NARRATOR:ROBB and BRYNDEN TULLY, waist deep in the river, release the funeral boat of HOSTER TULLY. They return to the dock to rejoin the somber and silent CATELYN and  TALISA.  EDMURE steps forward, holding a bow while the others look on. He lights the arrow and fires an arcing shot at the distant boat. The arrow splashes wide of its mark. Perturbed and embarrassed, EDMURE looks back, then draws another arrow to ignite. He shoots, and this arrow also splashes errantly, while the boat drifts further downstream. The large crowd near the dock murmurs. ROBB laughs under his breath and BRYNDEN looks impatient. EDUMRE takes a breath and unleashes a nervous shot that also splashes uselessly. Fed up, BRYNDEN pushes EDMURE aside and takes his bow. CATELYN, ROBB and TALISA try to maintain their composure. BRYNDEN lights an arrow, aims carefully, and unleashes an arcing shot. As the arrow flies, he turns and tosses the bow back to EDMURE, and walks off. Moments later, the arrow lands in the boat, setting it aflame. CATELYN is relieved. BRYNDEN continues to walk away. EDMURE watches as the flaming boat disappears at the river's bend."
11573,"INT: Riverrun war room, later"
11574,"EDMURE: If I may, nephew, I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing--"
11575,"BRYNDEN: Why don't you shut your mouth about that damned mill? And don't call him ""nephew."" He is your king."
11576,EDMURE: Robb knows I meant him no disr--
11577,BRYNDEN: You're lucky I'm not your king. I wouldn't let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag.
11578,"EDMURE: My blunder sent Tywin's mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs. I think King Robb understands we're not gonna win this war if he's the only one winning any battles. No, there's glory enough to go around."
11579,ROBB: It's not about glory. Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you.
11580,EDMURE: I seized an opportunity.
11581,ROBB: What value was the mill?
11582,EDMURE: The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it.
11583,ROBB: Is he there now? Of course not.
11584,EDMURE: We took the fight to him. He could not withstand us.
11585,"ROBB: I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west, into our country where we could surround him and kill him. I wanted him to chase us, which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head. I could have that head on a spike by now. Instead, I have a mill."
11586,EDMURE: We took hostages. Willem Lannister. Martyn Lannister.
11587,ROBB: Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old.
11588,"BRYNDEN: Martyn is 15, I believe."
11589,ROBB: Tywin Lannister has my sisters. Have I sued for peace?
11590,EDMURE: No.
11591,ROBB: Do you think he'll sue for peace because we have his father's brother's great-grandsons?
11592,EDMURE: No.
11593,ROBB: How many men did you lose?
11594,"EDMURE:  But for every man we lost, the Lannisters--"
11595,ROBB: We need our men more than Tywin needs his!
11596,EDMURE: I'm sorry. I didn't know.
11597,ROBB:  You would have. Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient.
11598,BRYNDEN: We seem to be running short of patience here.
11599,ROBB: You know who isn't? Tywin Lannister.
11600,"INT: King's Landing, the Small Council chamber."
11601,"NARRATOR:TYWIN stands by the head of the table. PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER enter silently. TYRION enters next. TYWIN sits, then PYCELLE, VARYS, and LITTLEFINGER join him. TYRION remains still, while CERSEI enters and surveys the room.  She pauses, then walks to the table. She picks up one of the two remaining empty chairs and places it directly next to TYWIN, then sits while the others smirk. TYRION comes forward, and drags the final chair noisily (and comically) to the opposite head of the table. He sits."
11602,TYRION: Intimate. Lovely table. Better chairs than the old small council chamber. Conveniently close to your own quarters. I like it.
11603,TYWIN: What news of Jaime?
11604,NARRATOR:No one answers.
11605,"TYWIN: 20,000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks. Collectively, you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined. Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is?"
11606,"VARYS: We are trying, my lord."
11607,"TYWIN:  Try harder. What do we have, then?"
11608,"VARYS: Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully. In Stark's absence, Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal, which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal, in practice if not in name."
11609,"TYWIN:  Well, let him have it. The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble. The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn."
11610,"LITTLEFINGER: For which I am extremely grateful to you, my lord.  Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children. She has always been positively predisposed toward me."
11611,PYCELLE: A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.
11612,LITTLEFINGER: Titles do seem to breed titles.
11613,TYWIN: You'll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold. Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him.
11614,"TYRION: Far be it from me to hinder true love, but Lord Baelish's absence would present certain problems. The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory. Summer has ended, hard days lie ahead. Not a good time to leave the crown's finances unattended."
11615,TYWIN: Fully agreed. Which is why I'm naming you new Master of Coin.
11616,CERSEI: (chuckles)
11617,TYRION: Master of Coin?
11618,TYWIN:  It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents.
11619,"TYRION: I'm quite good at spending money, but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasn't taught me much about managing it."
11620,CERSEI: I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge.
11621,"PYCELLE: Hear, hear."

11623,"NARRATOR:LOCKE's forces ride through the woods, singing."
11624,"MEN: (singing) He lifted her high in the air. He sniffed and roared and smelled her there. She kicked and wailed, a maid so fair. But he licked the honey from her hair. From there to here, from here to there. All black and brown and covered with hair. He smelled that girl in the summer air. The bear, the bear and the maiden fair."
11625,"NARRATOR:Behind the singing soldiers, BRIENNE and JAIME are bound together, back to back, atop a single horse. JAIME suffers the indignity of facing backwards."
11626,"JAIME:  I hope you're pleased. If you had armed me, they never would have taken us."
11627,BRIENNE: You were armed when we were taken.
11628,JAIME: I was in chains if you recall. Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands weren't bound.
11629,"BRIENNE: All my life I've been hearing, 'Jaime Lannister, what a brilliant swordsman.' You were slower than I expected. And more predictable."
11630,JAIME: I've been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year.
11631,BRIENNE: And I'm a woman. I was still beating you.
11632,JAIME: You were not beating me.
11633,BRIENNE: Maybe you were as good as people said once. Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name.
11634,"JAIME: When we make camp tonight, you'll be raped. More than once. None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman. You'd be wise not to resist."
11635,BRIENNE:  Would I?
11636,JAIME: They'll knock your teeth out.
11637,BRIENNE: You think I care about my teeth?
11638,"JAIME: No, I don't think you care about your teeth. If you fight them, they will kill you. Do you understand? I'm the prisoner of value, not you. Let them have what they want. What does it matter?"
11639,BRIENNE: What does it matter?
11640,JAIME: Close your eyes. Pretend they're Renly.
11641,"BRIENNE: If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist? You'd let them do what they wanted?"
11642,"JAIME:  If I was a woman, I'd make them kill me. But I'm not, thank the gods."

11645,"GENDRY: If I had a proper forge, I could make it good as new."
11646,THOROS: Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart.
11647,ARYA: Why are you helping him? He takes us prisoner and now he's our friend?
11648,"THOROS:  You're not our prisoner, little lady."
11649,ARYA:  What am I?
11650,THOROS: Our guest. No one's put any chains on you.

11654,"HOUND: You think you're good with that bow, you little twat?"
11655,ANGUY: Better than anyone you've ever met.
11656,HOUND: A coward's weapon. I like to fight up close. I like to see a man's face when I put the steel in him.
11657,ANGUY: Why? So you can kiss him?
11658,ARYA:  You remember the last time you were here?
11659,HOUND: Looks like every other shit inn on the road.

11668,GENDRY: You're what?
11669,"HOT PIE:  I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better. Told Thoros she's keeping me as a payment for all the free meals she's given him. Anyway, it's not me the Brotherhood wants. My brother ain't no king. I'm not a Stark of Winterhell."

11691,CATELYN: A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting we're at war.
11692,"BRYNDEN: It often comforts me to think that even in war's darkest days, in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening."
11693,"CATELYN: I've missed you, Uncle. Father missed you, too, from the day you left. Maybe he never said it in so many words--"
11694,BRYNDEN: Maybe? Your father was a stubborn old ox. I was surprised when he died. Didn't think death had the patience.
11695,CATELYN: I'm glad you were with him. I wish to the gods I had been. Did you make peace in the end?
11696,"BRYNDEN: After 30 years of fighting, I don't think he remembered what started it. He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish. He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with. I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long, they don't remember my real name."
11697,"CATELYN: Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign, I'd see him off. 'Wait for me, little Cat,' he'd say. 'Wait for me and I'll come back to you.' And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up, waiting. I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return. I will never see them again."
11698,NARRATOR:CATELYN begins to weep. BRYNDEN sits to comfort her.
11699,BRYNDEN: You mustn't think it. We don't know the truth. They could be in hiding. Robb believes they're alive. And he must go on believing. He's got to remain strong if he's to prevail. And you must remain strong for him.

11707,MARTYN:  That he can turn into a wolf at night.
11708,TALISA: True.
11709,MARTYN: And he eats the flesh of his enemies.
11710,"TALISA: True. You're a Lannister, aren't you?"
11711,MARTYN: Martyn Lannister.

11722,MANCE: And you know what those men are now?
11723,JON: (Nods)
11724,JON: Do you think anyone got away?
11725,"MANCE: It's not impossible. You don't go far betting against Mormont. But dead or alive, he took a big gamble coming north. And he lost. His best fighting men are dead. And whether he's Lord Commander of the Night's Watch or a blue-eyed corpse, he's a long way from home. Tormund. Climb the Wall. Take Orell and 20 good men. And take this one. He knows Castle Black's defenses better than any of us. And if he's useful, good. If not throw him off the Wall. See if crows can fly."
11726,"TORMUND: We're finally going to war, old friend?"

11747,CRASTER: Keep your eyes where they belong. They're not for you.  Karl TANNER: Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us.
11748,"CRASTER: Aye, pig's got value to me. You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in. I'd have turned you all away if I wasn't a godly man."
11749,JEOR: You are a godly man?
11750,"CRASTER: I am. I got no fear of what's out there. When the white cold comes, your swords and cloaks and bloody fires won't help you. The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods. The real gods."
11751,NARRATOR:The woman continues to wail in another room. Another woman pours some water for CRASTER.
11752,"CRASTER: Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist. Women. That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight. Barely a grunt. (Pointing to SAM) And she's almost as fat as this one here.  Now why don't you dine on him? Carve off what you need as you go. Well, look at him. He's a walking feast."

There's a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand. But the Unsullied are not men. They do not rape. They do not put cities to the sword unless they're ordered to do so. If you buy them, the only men they'll kill are those you want dead."

11830,"BARRISTAN: I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met."
11831,DAENERYS: I wish I had known him. But he was not the last dragon.

11834,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS, JORAH and BARRISTAN stand before a raised platform where KRAZNYS MO NAKLOZ and GREIZHEN sit and MISSANDEI stands."
11835,"MISSANDEI: All? Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?"
11836,DAENERYS: They did not. I want to buy them all.
11837,MISSANDEI: (speaking Valerian) She wants to buy them all.
11838,"KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) She can't afford them. The slut thinks that she can flash her tits, and make us give her whatever she wants."
11839,"MISSANDEI: There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor. Is this what you mean by all?"
11840,"DAENERYS: Yes. 8,000. And the ones still in training as well."
11841,"GREIZHEN: (speaking Valerian) If they fail on the battlefield, they will shape Astapor."
11842,"MISSANDEI: Master Greizhen says they cannot sell half-trained boys. If they fail on the battlefield, they will bring shame upon all of Astapor."
11843,DAENERYS: I will have them all or take none. Many will fall in battle. I'll need the boys to pick up the swords they drop.
11844,KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) The slut cannot pay for all of this.
11845,MISSANDEI: Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this.
11846,"KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied, no more."
11847,MISSANDEI: Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous.
11848,KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) And this is because I like the curve of her ass.
11849,MISSANDEI: The gold you have left is worth 10.
11850,KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) What is left will buy her 10. I will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering.
11851,MISSANDEI: But good Master Kraznys will give you 20.
11852,KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed.
11853,MISSANDEI: The Dothraki you have with you--
11854,KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) I will give her 3 for those.
11855,"MISSANDEI:  The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed, but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them."
11856,"KRAZNYS: (speaking Valerian) So, ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7,877?"
11857,"MISSANDEI: Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7,877 unsullied."
11858,NARRATOR:DAENERYS has been looking at the young enslaved children who watch from above.
11859,DAENERYS:  I have dragons. I'll give you one.

11865,KRAZNYS: Three dragons.

11872,DAENERYS:  Done.
11873,KRAZNYS:  Done.
11874,"DAENERYS: I'll take you as well, now. You'll be Master Kraznys' gift to me. A token of a bargain well struck."
11875,"MISSANDEI: (speaking Valerian) She asks that you give me to her, as a present. She asks that you do this now."
11876,CUT TO: outside the courtyard.
11877,NARRATOR:DAENERYS strides purposefully. JORAH and BARRISTAN try to keep up.
11878,"JORAH: Khaleesi, a dragon is worth more than any army."
11879,BARRISTAN: Aegon Targaryen proved that.
11880,"DAENERYS: You're both here to advise me. I value your advice, but if you ever question me in front of strangers again, you'll be advising someone else. Is that understood?"
11881,NARRATOR:JORAH and BARRISTAN nod. DAENERYS walks away and joins MISSANDEI
11882,DAENERYS: Do you have a name?
11883,"MISSANDEI: This one's name is Missandei, Your Grace."
11884,DAENERYS: Do you have a family? A mother and a father you'd return to if you had the choice?
11885,"MISSANDEI: No, Your Grace. No family living."
11886,DAENERYS: You belong to me now. It is your duty to tell me the truth.
11887,"MISSANDEI: Yes, Your Grace. Lying is a great offense. Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less."
11888,DAENERYS: I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment. Do you know what he said to me? 'Let me die.'
11889,"MISSANDEI: There are no masters in the grave, Your Grace."
11890,DAENERYS: Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied? About their obedience?
11891,"MISSANDEI: All questions have been taken from them. They obey, that is all. Once they are yours, they are yours. They will fall on their swords if you command it."
11892,DAENERYS: And what about you? You know that I'm taking you to war. You may go hungry. You may fall sick. You may be killed.
11893,MISSANDEI: Valar morghulis.
11894,"DAENERYS: Yes, all men must die. But we are not men."

11896,NARRATOR:ROS kneels at a hidden compartment in the floor. She hands PODRICK a series of ledgers. He admires her assets. She notices.
11897,TYRION: A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers.
11898,LITTLEFINGER: I'm surprised you're surprised. This is the safest place in the city.
11899,TYRION: Not for bastards.
11900,"ROS: That's all of them, my lord."
11901,"LITTLEFINGER: Thank you, my dear."
11902,TYRION: Pod. Pod. Take them outside. I'll be there in a moment.
11903,"PODRICK:  Yes, my lord."
11904,NARRATOR:PODRICK wheels the ledges away in a cart. ROS exits as well.
11905,LITTLEFINGER: I hear you owe that boy a significant debt.
11906,"TYRION: Only my life. Not all that significant, I'm afraid."
11907,LITTLEFINGER: You should have him knighted.
11908,TYRION: If only the Master of Coin had such power.
11909,LITTLEFINGER: If only. I owe you a significant debt. Our redheaded friend. You secured her release when the queen detained her.
11910,"TYRION: Oh, that. Of course. A simple misunderstanding."
11911,"LITTLEFINGER: Apparently, Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship."
11912,TYRION: We don't. I did fuck her once.
11913,LITTLEFINGER:  I know.
11914,TYRION:  But we don't.
11915,LITTLEFINGER: I know. But how would the queen get that idea?
11916,TYRION: Why don't you ask her? Any advice for me on my new position?
11917,LITTLEFINGER: Keep a low profile.
11918,"TYRION: If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke, I'd be richer than you are."
11919,"LITTLEFINGER: Well, you are richer than I am."
11920,TYRION: Good point.
11921,"LITTLEFINGER: They're only numbers. Numbers on paper. Once you understand that, it's easy to make them behave. Trivial even. You want a real challenge? Try whores."
11922,"TYRION: I've tried quite a few. Well, lots of work to do. Enjoy the Eyrie."
11923,CUT TO: The hallway outside Littlefinger's chambers.

11926,NARRATOR:BRONN hops down and follows TYRION. BRONN trails with the wagon.
11927,"BRONN: Tonight, then. Looks like dull reading."
11928,TYRION: You think all reading is dull reading.
11929,BRONN: It's an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know.
11930,TYRION: The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages.
11931,BRONN: Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what he's really up to.
11932,"TYRION: Unless he made it all up, yes.  Podrick, do keep up."
11933,"PODRICK:  Yes, my lord."
11934,TYRION:  Podrick.
11935,"PODRICK:  Yes, my lord?"
11936,"TYRION: After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn, I finally found a suitable reward for the services you've provided over and above what might be considered reasonable. Tell me, Pod, have you ever been with a woman?"
11937,"NARRATOR:They open a door and enter a chamber. GENNA, naked, lies on the bed."
11938,"PODRICK: No, my lord."
11939,TYRION:  Wonderful. Genna specializes in first-timers.
11940,"BRONN: She's not bad with second-timers, either."
11941,"PODRICK: Uh, my lord"
11942,"NARRATOR:GENNA walks over to PODRICK, smiling, and places her hands on him."
11943,"TYRION: A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my would-be killer's face, wouldn't you say?"
11944,"NARRATOR:TYRION walks further into the chamber, and pushes aside a curtain, revealing the naked MAREI."
11945,"TYRION: Now, as it happens, Marei is quite the spear handler herself. She's here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me."
11946,"NARRATOR:MAREI walks over to PRODICK, and begins to help KALYA to undress him."
11947,MAREI: He's handsome. You didn't tell me he was handsome.

11949,TYRION: Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles. One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot.
11950,"PODRICK: My lord, I don't even"
11951,TYRION:  She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as 'my lord.
11952,NARRATOR:KAYLA performs an impressive and seductive back bend for PODRICK.

11957,"NARRATOR:TYRION pours over the ledgers. BRONN wanders through the room, inspecting various objects, not impressed by any."
11958,"TYRION: For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician. Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold."
11959,BRONN: Let me guess. He's not a magician.
11960,TYRION: No.
11961,BRONN:  He's stealing it?
11962,"TYRION: Worse, he's borrowing it."
11963,BRONN: What's wrong with that?
11964,"TYRION: We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it. The crown owes millions to my father."
11965,"BRONN: Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt."
11966,"TYRION: Forgive a debt, my father? For a man of the world, you're strangely naive."
11967,BRONN: I've never borrowed money before. I'm not clear on the rules.
11968,"TYRION: Well Ahem! The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest."
11969,BRONN: And what if I don't?
11970,"TYRION: Well, you have to."
11971,BRONN: But what if I don't?
11972,"TYRION: This is why I don't lend you money. Anyway, it's not my father I'm worried about. It's the Iron Bank of Braavos. We owe them tens of millions. If we fail to repay these loans, the bank will fund our enemies. One way or another, they always get their gold back."
11973,NARRATOR:PODRICK enters.
11974,"TYRION: Ah, the return of the conquering hero. Does he have a little jaunt in his step?"
11975,BRONN: The lad's practically skipping.
11976,TYRION: You were gone a long time. I trust you got your money's worth. Or should I say my money's worth?
11977,NARRATOR:PODRICK returns the purse to TYRION.
11978,"TYRION: Oh, it was a gift, Podrick. This is more than I give you in a year."
11979,BRONN: He's a squire. You don't pay him.
11980,"TYRION: Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year."
11981,"PODRICK: They wouldn't take it, my lord."
11982,BRONN: Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.
11983,TYRION: Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold? They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
11984,BRONN: What did you tell them?
11985,PODRICK: I didn't tell them anything.
11986,TYRION:  What did you do to them?
11987,PODRICK: Lots of things.
11988,TYRION: And they seemed to like these things?
11989,"PODRICK: Yes, my lord."
11990,BRONN: Of course they seemed to like it. They're paid to seem to like it.
11991,TYRION: Only they weren't paid.
11992,"BRONN: What are you saying? These ladies enjoyed him so much, they gave him the time for free?"
11993,TYRION: Is that what you're telling us?  {PODRICK doesn't deny it.
11994,"TYRION: Sit down, Podrick."

12001,"NARRATOR:The soldiers close the distance to THEON. His horse jumps a broken wall as he rides into the trees. The soldiers give chase close behind.

12002,SOLDIER: Ha! Ha!

12010,"THEON: No, please! No, no, no! No, don't!"

THEON looks up, then works up his pants. RAMSAY approaches, bow in hand. The first soldier that he shot is still on his knees, in shock. RAMSAY stops in front of him, and reaches for another arrow."
12014,SOLDIER #2: You little bastard.

12024,"BRIENNE: My lord, I am Brienne of Tarth. Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to King's Landing."
12025,LOCKE: Catelyn Stark's a treasonous cunt. Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive. Nobody said shit about you.
12026,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE headbutts one of the four men around her. But with her hands bound, she has no chance. The men hold her and punch her into submission."
12027,MAN: You're only making it worse.

12032,"JAIME: You know who she is, don't you?"
12033,LOCKE: A big dumb bitch from who cares where. Never been with a woman that big.
12034,JAIME: She's Brienne of Tarth. Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth. Heard of Tarth?
12035,MAN: I'm gonna cut your throat!
12036,JAIME: They call it the Sapphire Isle. Do you know why? Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth. Sapphires are gemstones. The blue ones.
12037,LOCKE: I know what they are.
12038,"JAIME: Lord Selwyn would pay his daughter's weight in sapphires if she's returned to him. But only if she's alive, her honor unbesmirched."

12052,"LOCKE: Aye, you have both."
12053,JAIME: Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable. Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding.
12054,LOCKE: Hard to argue with that.
12055,"JAIME: Now that we're speaking together man to man, I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree. I'm not asking to be freed from my constraints, but if I could sleep lying down, my back would thank you for it. I'm not as young and resilient as I was once."
12056,LOCKE: None of us are. Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.

12068,LOCKE: You think you're the smartest man there is. That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.
12069,JAIME:  My father--
12070,"LOCKE: And if you get in any trouble, all you've got to do is say 'my father' and that's it, all your troubles are gone."

12072,LOCKE:  Have you got something to say?
12073,NARRATOR:JAIME does not respond.

12104,TYRION: I hope we might speak. In confidence.
12105,"VARYS: Oh, always in confidence."
12106,NARRATOR:VARYS works to open a large crate with a crowbar
12107,TYRION: About the events of the Blackwater. Perhaps this is the wrong time?
12108,"VARYS: Oh, no. It's a wonderful time."
12109,TYRION: I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sister's intentions to--
12110,VARYS: End your life?
12111,"TYRION: I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies along with his position, I'm afraid. Which is why I'm coming to you. I need proof."
12112,VARYS: Proof? Will there be a trial?
12113,TYRION: I need to know.
12114,"VARYS: I have no proof, only whispers. Before all this nastiness, I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut. Do you want to hear it still?"
12115,TYRION: I don't know. Do I?
12116,NARRATOR:VARYS pauses from his efforts to open the crate.
12117,"VARYS: As a boy, I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities. One day in Myr, a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse. I feared the man meant to use me as I'd heard some men used small boys. But what he wanted was far worse. He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak, yet did nothing to dull my senses. With a hooked blade he sliced me, root and stem, chanting all the while. He burned my parts in a brazier. The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call. I still dream of that night. Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade. I dream of the voice from the flames. Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick? I don't know. But the sorcerer called and a voice answered. And ever since that day, I have hated magic and all those who practice it. But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess. A symbolic revenge of sorts."
12118,"TYRION: Yes, ahem. I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed. Which will require a degree of influence, which--"
12119,VARYS: You do not possess at the moment.
12120,NARRATOR:Varys puts down the crowbar and moves to a basin to wash his hands and freshen up.
12121,"VARYS: But influence is largely a matter of patience, I have found. Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose, he threw me out of his house to die. I resolved to live to spite him. I begged. I sold what parts of my body remained to me. I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a man's letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse. Step by step, one distasteful task after another, I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber. Influence grows like a weed. I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special."
12122,NARRATOR:VARYS removes the top of the crate. He and TYRION peer in. VARYS protects his nose from the stink. TYRION is aghast.
12123,TYRION: The sorcerer.
12124,NARRATOR:The sorcerer lies helplessly in the crate. His mouth has been sewn shut long ago. He mumbles desperately behind his sewn mouth.
12125,"VARYS: Hello, my old friend. It's been a long time. I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it."
12126,"NARRATOR:VARYS returns the lid, in spite of the SORCERER's protests."
12127,EXT: Craster's Keep.
12128,"NARRATOR:GRENN and EDDISON TOLLETT work in the pig sty, shoveling mud and shit."
12129,"GRENN: When people talk about the Night's Watch, they never mention the shoveling."
12130,EDDISON: Or the shit.
12131,"GRENN: They tell you about honor, pardoning crimes, and protecting the realm, but shoveling really is most of it."
12132,EDDISON: And getting attacked or killed or worse. And that.
12133,"GRENN: But when you're not getting attacked or killed, usually you're shoveling."
12134,"EDDISON: Oh, look. More shit. I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day."
12135,NARRATOR:RAST stands at the side of the pig sty.
12136,RAST: We need to get out of here.
12137,"GRENN: When the Lord Commander says we go, we go."
12138,RAST: The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men. How'd that turn out for us?
12139,EDDISON: He had no way of knowing.
12140,RAST: We do now. We know what's out there.
12141,GRENN: Craster's been out here surviving.
12142,RAST: So he's your new protector now? Our good friend Craster?
12143,EDDISON: We're like the sons he never had.
12144,"RAST: Mormont isn't gonna save you. This lummox here isn't gonna save you. When the walkers come calling, Craster will serve us up like so many pigs. If we want to live we'll have to look out for ourselves."

12146,"NARRATOR:GILLY cradles her baby, who gently fusses."
12147,"GILLY: Shh, shh, shh."
12148,NARRATOR:GILLY stands anxiously as SAM enters.
12149,GILLY: You woke him.
12150,SAM: I'm sorry. He's beautiful.
12151,GILLY: Shh!
12152,"NARRATOR:The baby cries, and Gilly soothes him."
12153,SAM: He's beautiful.  Does he have a name?
12154,GILLY: No.
12155,SAM: Are you going to give him one?
12156,GILLY: Why?
12157,NARRATOR:GILLY hands SAM the thimble that he gave her when they last saw one another.
12158,GILLY: Here.
12159,SAM: Gilly.
12160,GILLY: You said to hold it for you until you came back. You're back.
12161,SAM: I wanted you to have it.
12162,GILLY: I don't want your stupid thimble. I want to save my baby's life. Can you do that? Can you?
12163,NARRATOR:SAM doesn't answer.
12164,GILLY: I don't have time for you. I don't have time for anyone but him because he doesn't have much time.
12165,NARRATOR:The baby starts to cry loudly. SAM exits.
12166,"EXT: Woods, somewhere."
12167,NARRATOR:BRAN runs through the woods. A raven caws overhead. BRAN comes upon a godswood. JOJEN appears by his side.
12168,JOJEN: You have to go after him.
12169,BRAN: How?
12170,JOJEN: You know how.
12171,NARRATOR:BRAN climbs to the high branches of the godswood until he finds the raven. He balances his way carefully to the raven.
12172,CATELYN: Brandon.
12173,NARRATOR:Catelyn appears behind him in the tree.
12174,BRAN: Mother.
12175,CATELYN: How many times have I told you? No climbing.
12176,"BRAN: Mother, I need to find it. It's here. It's calling me."
12177,NARRATOR:CATELYN grabs him roughly.
12178,CATELYN: I want you to promise me. No more climbing.
12179,NARRATOR:She shakes BRAN as her voice rises in volume.
12180,CATELYN: Promise me. Promise me! Promise me!
12181,NARRATOR:CATELYN shakes him so hard that BRAN looses his footing and he falls from the tree.
12182,BRAN: Mother! Mother!
12183,"CATELYN: Promise me! Promise me, Bran! Promise me!"
12184,CUT TO: Northern Woods at Night.
12185,"NARRATOR:BRAN wakes suddenly before he hits the ground in his dream. He sits up. JOJEN watches him, wordlessly."
12186,INT: King's Landing
12187,NARRATOR:VARYS and ROS speak in his chambers.
12188,VARYS: Is he very large?
12189,"ROS: No larger than usual, apparently. And yet they said that he was--"
12190,VARYS: Extraordinary.
12191,ROS: The most extraordinary man they've ever had. And they've had a lot of men.
12192,VARYS: We're talking about the same Podrick? The quiet boy in Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?
12193,ROS: (nods)
12194,VARYS: What did he do to them?
12195,"ROS: I don't know, my lord. The girls are usually quite descriptive."
12196,VARYS: So what did they say?
12197,ROS: They said it was hard to describe.
12198,NARRATOR:VARYS pours her some wine.
12199,VARYS: Huh. Prodigies appear in the oddest of places. And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income?
12200,ROS: He was too preoccupied to notice. He's leaving for the Eyrie soon. I'm helping him prepare for his journey.
12201,"VARYS: Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her. Sad, really. Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark?"
12202,"ROS: He hasn't spoken to her since the last time, as far as I know. But I don't think he's lost interest."
12203,VARYS: What makes you say so?
12204,ROS: His shipboard inventory.
12205,NARRATOR:Ros produces a scroll and hands it to Varys. He opens it.
12206,VARYS: Ah. You can read. Rare for a woman in your profession.
12207,ROS: Former profession.
12208,VARYS: Of course. I'm missing something obvious you're about to point out?
12209,ROS: Two featherbeds. He's bringing two featherbeds for the cabin.
12210,VARYS: Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger? Could he be bringing one of his girls?
12211,"ROS: He's not interested in them, my lord."
12212,VARYS: How do you know?
12213,ROS: Because I'm one of his girls.
12214,VARYS: Prodigies in odd places indeed.
12215,"INT: King's Landing, the Sept of Baelor"
12216,"JOFFREY: Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother, or rather his dragon. It ate her while her son watched. What's left of her is buried in the crypts right down there."
12217,"CERSEI: The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum, which seats 700 comfortably"
12218,OLENNA:  There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else.
12219,CERSEI: There aren't more than 700 people of any importance.
12220,"OLENNA: No, the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats."
12221,"JOFFREY: Over there in that urn, the ashes of Aerion Targaryen. Aerion Brightflame they called him. He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon."
12222,MARGAERY: (laughs)
12223,"JOFFREY: He was wrong. And, of course, there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle. Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried?"
12224,CERSEI: Are you sure Lady Margaery doesn't find all this a bit macabre?
12225,"MARGAERY: Oh, no, it's quite all right, Your Grace. I'd love to see their tombs, really. It's like taking a walk through history."
12226,JOFFREY: The tomb's just up here.
12227,MARGAERY: This is so exciting.
12228,NARRATOR:JOFFREY and MARGAERY exit.
12229,"OLENNA: You were married here, Your Grace?"
12230,CERSEI: Yes.
12231,OLENNA: Must seem like only yesterday.
12232,CERSEI: Seems like a lifetime ago.
12233,"OLENNA: Your husband, was he buried here as well?"
12234,"CERSEI: No, he wanted his remains returned to Storm's End."
12235,OLENNA: Such a tragedy.
12236,CERSEI: A fairly predictable tragedy. Hunting and drinking don't mix.
12237,OLENNA: I should say not. My son's a hunter. It helps him forget he's never been within a mile of a real battle.
12238,CERSEI: I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's End for the better part of a year.
12239,OLENNA: All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent.
12240,CERSEI: (chuckles)
12241,"OLENNA: I told him to stay out of Robert's rebellion. He had no business fighting an actual warrior. We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave. But they do seem to yearn for it. We shower them with good sense, and it slides right off like rain off a wing."
12242,CERSEI: And yet the world belongs to them.
12243,"OLENNA: A ridiculous arrangement, to my mind."
12244,MARGAERY: (laughs)
12245,CERSEI: The gods have seen fit to make it so.
12246,CUT TO: the tombs
12247,"JOFFREY: My father didn't want them here. He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater, but the High Septon convinced him otherwise."
12248,"MARGAERY: I'm glad he did. I'm sorry, Your Grace. I know they did terrible things at the end, but their ancestors built this. Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness."
12249,JOFFREY: I couldn't agree more.
12250,NARRATOR:They hear the sounds of a shouting crowd outside the Sept.
12251,"MARGAERY: Shall we go and see them? If you give them your love, they will return it a thousandfold. I've spoken with them. I know how they feel about you. You led the defense of King's Landing. They adore you."
12252,JOFFREY: Open the doors.
12253,NARRATOR:The doors open.
12254,CERSEI: Joffrey. Wait.
12255,NARRATOR:JOFFREY and MARGAERY step out of the sept.

12270,EXT: Somewhere in the North
12271,NARRATOR:THEON and RAMSEY ride slowly through the woods.
12272,THEON: How far is it to Deepwood Motte?
12273,"RAMSAY: Not far, my lord. Your sister is waiting for you there."
12274,THEON: She sent you to save me?
12275,"RAMSAY: Yes. I served them, the men who were torturing you. I did what they told me and waited for the right moment."
12276,THEON: Why would you risk your life for me?
12277,"RAMSAY: I grew up on Saltcliffe, my lord. I was only a boy when they took you away. My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off. I remember the look on my father's face when he told us, 'That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son.' And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you."
12278,"THEON: Those men, they said my father knew what they were doing to me. Did he?"
12279,"CUT TO: The woods, a bit later."
12280,NARRATOR:THEON and RAMSAY leap over a wall and move furtively along it in the rain. They approach a small castle.
12281,THEON: My sister's men are loyal to her. We don't need to hide from them.
12282,RAMSAY: Not all those are your sister's men. Some of them are loyal to your father.
12283,NARRATOR:RAMSAY opens the lower gate leading into the castle. It leads to a long hallway.
12284,THEON: (chuckles)
12285,RAMSAY:  What is it?
12286,THEON: I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place.
12287,RAMSAY: What did he tell you to do?
12288,THEON: Raid fishing villages. He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark. Ha. I could never be a Stark. Robb Stark always reminded me of that.
12289,RAMSAY: He lorded it over you?
12290,THEON: Didn't have to. All he had to do was be. Be who he was born to be. His life fit him better than his clothes. How could someone like that ever be a brother to me? He's the King in the North.
12291,NARRATOR:They reach another gate. RAMSAY works to open it with his keys.
12292,"THEON: And me my father gave me a choice and I made it. I could never be a Stark. But ironborn, that's what I was born to be. I paid the iron price for Winterfell. I murdered those boys."
12293,NARRATOR:RAMSAY finally has worked the gate open.
12294,RAMSAY: The Stark boys?
12295,THEON: Never found them. Just some poor orphans living with a farmer. I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud.
12296,RAMSAY: Maybe it's not too late.
12297,THEON: It is. My real father lost his head at King's Landing. I made a choice and I chose wrong. And now I've burned everything down.
12298,"RAMSAY: Not everything, my lord. She's up here."
12299,NARRATOR:THEON and RAMSAY continue past the gate and through somedoors. The room is black.
12300,THEON: Yara.
12301,RAMSAY: Shh. Wait.
12302,NARRATOR:RAMSAY lights a torch. The room brightens to reveal the X-shaped cross on which Theon had been tortured.
12303,RAMSAY: I brought him back. He killed the others.
12304,NARRATOR:THEON is stunned.
12305,"THEON: What? No, I didn't."
12306,"NARRATOR:Some guards appear behind THEON. One grabs his shoulder, spins him and punches him in the gut."
12307,"THEON: You can't! No, please stop! No!"
12308,NARRATOR:The two guards wrestle THEON back onto the cross. He sobs and yells.
12309,RAMSAY: Put him back where he belongs.
12310,NARRATOR:RAMSAY smiles. THEON screams.
12311,NARRATOR:EXT. The Riverlands
12312,NARRATOR:LOCKE's men continue their ride. JAIME is half-conscious. BRIENNE tries desperately to think of a plan.
12313,"CUT TO: The Riverlands, that night."
12314,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE sits, bound and thinking, her brow still furrowed."
12315,BRIENNE: Eat. What are you doing?
12316,JAIME: I'm dying.
12317,BRIENNE: You can't die. You need to live to take revenge.
12318,JAIME: I don't care about revenge.
12319,BRIENNE: You coward. A little misfortune and you're giving up.
12320,BRIENNE: You lost your hand.
12321,JAIME: My sword hand. I was that hand.
12322,NARRATOR:BRIENNE and JAIME sit in silence. JAIME reaches for the bread and takes a bite.
12323,BRIENNE: I know what you did for me. You told them Tarth was full of sapphires. It's called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water. You knew that. Why did you help me?
12324,NARRATOR:JAIME doesn't answer.
12325,"INT: King's Landing, Tywin's chambers."
12326,"NARRATOR:TYWIN writes while CERSEI looks on, impatiently."
12327,TYWIN: You wanted to speak to me?
12328,"CERSEI: Yes, about Jaime."
12329,TYWIN: What about him?
12330,CERSEI: I wanted to make sure we're doing everything we can to get him back.
12331,TYWIN: When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response?
12332,CERSEI: You started a war.
12333,"TYWIN: And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump, what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir?"
12334,CERSEI: Whatever you can.
12335,TYWIN: Whatever I can.
12336,"NARRATOR:Tywin seals the letter he finished, and starts another one."
12337,TYWIN: You're still here.
12338,CERSEI: Yes.
12339,TYWIN: Why?
12340,TYWIN: All right. Contribute.
12341,CERSEI: The Tyrells are a problem.
12342,"TYWIN: The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon. The Tyrells saved your life, your children's lives."
12343,CERSEI: Margaery has her claws in Joffrey. She knows how to manipulate him.
12344,TYWIN: Good. I wish you knew how to manipulate him. I don't distrust you because you're a woman. I distrust you because you're not as smart as you think you are. You've allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city.
12345,NARRATOR:TYWIN goes back to writing.
12346,CERSEI: Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes.
12347,TYWIN: I will.
12348,EXT: King's Landing Garden
12349,NARRATOR:OLENNA sits thinking.
12350,"MAID: Do you like it, Nana?"
12351,"OLENNA: Another golden rose. How original. I eat from plates stamped with roses. I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses. I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot, as if that makes it smell any better. Roses are boring, dear. 'Growing strong.' Ha! The dullest words of any house. 'Winter is coming!' Now that's memorable. 'We do not sow.' Strong. Strong. Those are houses you watch out for. Direwolves and krakens, fierce beasts. But a golden rose growing strong--ha, that strikes fear in the heart."
12352,NARRATOR:VARYS approaches.
12353,"OLENNA: Look, little loves. A spider in the garden. Run along now. Grow strong."
12354,NARRATOR:The maids exit and VARYS arrives.
12355,VARYS: My lady. I wanted to personally welcome you to King's Landing. The city has been made brighter by your presence.
12356,"OLENNA: The city is made brighter by my presence? Is that your usual line, Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?"
12357,"VARYS: A little obvious, perhaps."
12358,"OLENNA: Oh, no, please. Seduce away. It's been so long. Though I rather think it's all for naught. What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit? A question for the philosophers. But you've come mincing all this way for something. So?"
12359,VARYS: Might I sit?
12360,"OLENNA: No. Come, I've heard you're such a clever man. I'm curious why you've sought me out."
12361,VARYS: You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark.
12362,OLENNA: Have I? Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you? Why shouldn't I take an interest? She's an interesting girl.
12363,VARYS: Is she?
12364,"OLENNA: No, not particularly. But she's had an interesting childhood."
12365,NARRATOR:VARYS moves to leave.
12366,"VARYS: She has, sadly. Well, forgive me for wasting your time, then. I thought we shared certain hopes for her well-being."
12367,"OLENNA: Come, come. You surrender rather easily. Walk with me. I know the walls have ears, but apparently the shrubbery does, too."
12368,CUT TO: Another part of the garden.
12369,NARRATOR:Varys and Olenna walk together.
12370,VARYS: I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still.
12371,OLENNA: Which is Sansa Stark?
12372,VARYS: Neither. A babe in the woods. I admired her father.
12373,"OLENNA: Yes. Ned Stark had many admirers, and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head?"
12374,VARYS: I could not help Lord Stark. Perhaps I can help his daughter.
12375,OLENNA: How?
12376,VARYS: You're not the only one who has taken an interest in her.
12377,OLENNA: That's hardly surprising. She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.
12378,VARYS: Indeed. She'd make a lovely match for the right suitor.
12379,OLENNA: It almost feels as if you're about to arrive at the point.
12380,"VARYS: Littlefinger is not long for the capital. A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes, Sansa Stark goes with him."
12381,OLENNA: And why have you come to me with this matter?
12382,"VARYS: Littlefinger was born with no lands, no wealth, no armies. He has acquired the first two. How long before he has the army?"
12383,OLENNA: (laughs)
12384,"VARYS: Perhaps you'll laugh, but I know him better than most and this is the truth. Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros. If Robb Stark falls, Sansa Stark is the key to the North."
12385,"OLENNA: And if Littlefinger marries her, he'll have the key in his pocket."
12386,VARYS: Which seems such a shame. Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride?
12387,OLENNA: You must despise him. You're working so hard to undermine him.
12388,"VARYS: Actually, I rather enjoy him. But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes."
12389,"OLENNA: You are a clever man, Lord Varys."
12390,VARYS: You are too kind. I believe I have a possible solution.

12393,"NARRATOR:SANSA kneels at a rocky overlook, praying. MARGAERY approaches."
12394,MARGAERY: Ahem. I didn't mean to disturb you.
12395,SANSA: You haven't.
12396,"MARGAERY: We'd like some privacy, please. If you wouldn't mind waiting back inside the keep. Or if you'd be kind enough to give me your names, I'll ask the king to speak with you himself."
12397,NARRATOR:The two guards leave.
12398,MARGAERY: What did you pray for?
12399,SANSA: I can't tell you.
12400,"MARGAERY: Why not? I'll tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning. Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter. Boring and traditional, I'm afraid. And you?"
12401,"SANSA: I'm sorry, I just can't."
12402,"MARGAERY: My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen. When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me. Pig-face, she called me."
12403,SANSA: Pig-face? That's ridiculous.
12404,"MARGAERY: I think it had something to do with my nose. Whenever she passed me in the halls, she'd oink."
12405,SANSA: (laughs)
12406,"MARGAERY: So I prayed that she'd catch a horrible skin disease. A week after that, she came down with porridge plague."
12407,SANSA: Porridge plague?
12408,MARGAERY: You don't have it in the North? Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony.
12409,SANSA: But that's awful.
12410,"MARGAERY: (nods, laughs)"
12411,"MARGAERY: Don't say that. No, you're not."
12412,SANSA: So what happened to Alanna?
12413,"MARGAERY: Oh, she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea. It's all terribly frustrating."
12414,NARRATOR:They arrive at another overlook.
12415,SANSA: I'm sure she's jealous of you now. You'll be married here in the capital and she'll have to come watch and pretend to be happy that you're queen.

12417,"MARGAERY: I want us to be friends, good friends."
12418,SANSA: That would make me very happy.
12419,MARGAERY: You must see Highgarden. You'd love it there. I know you would. We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon. You should see the costumes. People work on them for months.
12420,"MARGAERY: The Queen Regent, you mean. Once I marry Joffrey, I'll be queen. And if you were to marry Loras. . .  Oh, your place would be at Highgarden, wouldn't it? We would be sisters, you and I. Would you like that?"

12432,RAST: You on his side?
12433,"SAM: We can't just show up and steal all his food. We're brothers of the Night's Watch, not thieves."
12434,"RAST: The day we leave, Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow. He's a bloody wildling is all he is."

12447,"KARL TANNER: Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?"
12448,JEOR: Wait outside.
12449,KARL TANNER: It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.
12450,CRASTER: My wives gave you bread.
12451,KARL TANNER: There's sawdust in the bread.

12503,THOROS: Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling.
12504,HOUND: You look like a bunch of swineherds.
12505,ANGUY: Some of us were swineherds. And some of us tanners and masons. That was before.
12506,HOUND: You're still swineherds and tanners and masons. You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier?
12507,NARRATOR:BERIC enters.
12508,BERIC: No. Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.
12509,HOUND: Beric Dondarrion? You've seen better days.
12510,BERIC: And I won't see them again.
12511,HOUND: Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters. You lot aren't fighting in a war. You're running from it.

12513,HOUND: Untie these ropes and we'll find out. What are you doing leading a mob of peasants?
12514,BERIC: Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Robert's name.

12520,"HOUND: If you mean to murder me, then bloody well get on with it."
12521,"THOROS: You'll die soon enough, dog. But it won't be murder, only justice."
12522,"ANGUY: And a kinder fate than you deserve. Lions you call yourselves. At the Mummer's Ford, girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched."
12523,HOUND: I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford. Dump your dead children at some other door.
12524,THOROS: House Clegane was built upon dead children. I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.
12525,HOUND: Do you take me for my brother? Is being born Clegane a crime?
12526,ANGUY: Murder is a crime.
12527,"HOUND: I never touched the Targaryen babes. I never saw them, never smelled them, never heard them bawling. You want to cut my throat, get on with it! But don't call me murderer and pretend that you're not."
12528,ARYA: You murdered Mycah. The butchers boy. My friend. He was 12 years old. He was unarmed. And you rode him down. You slung him over your horse like he was some deer.
12529,"HOUND: Aye, he was a bleeder."
12530,BERIC: You don't deny killing this boy?
12531,HOUND: I was Joffrey's sworn shield. The boy attacked the prince.
12532,ARYA: That's a lie! I hit Joffrey. Mycah just ran away.
12533,HOUND: Then I should have killed you. Not my place to question princes.
12534,"BERIC: You stand accused of murder. But no one here knows the truth of the charge, so it is not for us to judge you. Only the Lord of Light may do that now. I sentence you to trial by combat."
12535,"HOUND: So, who will it be? Should we find out if your fire god really loves you, priest? Or you, archer? What are you worth with a sword in your hand? Or is the little girl the bravest one here?"
12536,BERIC: Aye. She might be. But it's me you'll fight.

12665,JON: You seemed to like it.
12666,"YGRITTE: Aye, I liked it some. Who taught you that?"
12667,JON: There's been no one else. Only you.
12668,YGRITTE: A maid. You were a maid.
12669,JON: I was a man of the Night's Watch. How about you? Were you a maid?
12670,YGRITTE: What do you think?
12671,JON: Who was he?
12672,"YGRITTE: Just a boy. He came trading with his brothers. He had red hair like me. Kissed by fire. But he was weak. Not like you. That was the first one. Then there was this Thenn boy. Spoke no Common, but gods, he was built like a mammoth."
12673,"JON: Yeah, thanks. I think I've heard enough. We'd best get back. Tormund--"
12674,NARRATOR:YGRITTE sits astride JON.

12678,"NARRATOR:YGRITTE hops up and jumps into the pool beside the cascading water.  Jon joins her, and they kiss again."

12682,HOUND: I want my gold.
12683,THOROS: It says it clearly right there on that note you'll be repaid in full when the war is over.
12684,HOUND: Piss on that! You're nothing but thieves.
12685,NARRATOR:The HOUND throws down the note.
12686,ANGUY: We're outlaws. Outlaws steal. You're lucky we didn't kill you.
12687,"HOUND: Come try it, archer. I'll shove those arrows up your ass."
12688,NARRATOR:The HOUND walks towards ANGUY but THOROS holds him back.
12689,ARYA: You can't let him go. He's a murderer. He's guilty.
12690,BERIC: Not in the eyes of god.
12691,ARYA: You can't!
12692,BERIC: Enough! The judgment isn't ours to make.
12693,NARRATOR:ANGUY tossed the HOUND his swords.

12701,MAN #2: Down!
12702,"LOCKE: On your knees. Lord Bolton, I give you the Kingslayer."
12703,"LOCKE pushes JAIME down with his foot. JAIME falls on his face, without resistance. JAIME groans.  Roose BOLTON: Pick him up, Locke."
12704,Locke picks up Jaime with the help of one of his men.  Roose BOLTON: You've lost a hand.
12705,"LOCKE: No, my lord, he has it here."
12706,LOCKE taunts JAIME with the dismembered hand tied around his neck. ROOSE pulls the hand from around JAIME's neck and hands it to LOCKE.  Roose BOLTON: Take this away.
12707,"LOCKE: Send it to his father?  Roose BOLTON: You'll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it.  Roose BOLTON: Cut her free. Apologies, my lady. You're under my protection now."
12708,NARRATOR:BRIENNE is cut free.
12709,"BRIENNE: Thank you, my lord.  Roose BOLTON: Find suitable rooms for our guests. We'll speak later."

12711,JAIME: Lord Bolton.
12712,NARRATOR:ROOSE turns around.
12713,JAIME: Is there word from the capital?  Roose BOLTON: You haven't heard? Stannis Baratheon laid siege to King's Landing. Sailed into Blackwater Bay. Stormed the gates with thousands of men. And your sister How can I put this? Your sister is alive and well. Your father's forces prevailed.
12714,NARRATOR:JAIME falls to his knees in relief.
12715,ROOSE: Ser Jaime isn't well. Take him to Qyburn.
12716,"NARRATOR:His men pick JAIME up, and lead him and BRIENNE away."
12717,"NARRATOR:INT; Harrenhal, Qyburn's workspace."
12718,"NARRATOR:QYBURN tends to JAIME's, and he winces and groans. His severed wrist is wet and disgusting."
12719,JAIME: Will I die?
12720,QYBURN: No. The corruption has spread. I fear it must be cut away. The safest course would be to take the whole arm off.
12721,JAIME: Then you'll die. You're no maester. Where's your chain?
12722,"QYBURN: The Citadel stripped me of it. They found some of my experiments too bold. I can leave your upper arm, make the cut at your elbow."
12723,"NARRATOR:JAIME chokes QYBURN to make his point, then relents."
12724,JAIME: I don't need my right hand to kill you.
12725,JAIME: Mmm.
12726,"QYBURN: With any luck, that will suffice. You'll need milk of the poppy."
12727,JAIME: No milk of the poppy.
12728,QYBURN: There will be pain.
12729,JAIME: I'll scream.
12730,QYBURN: Quite a bit of pain.
12731,JAIME: I'll scream loudly.

12735,CERSEI: Lord Baelish.
12736,LITTLEFINGER: Your Grace.
12737,CERSEI: I wonder if I might ask you for a favor.
12738,NARRATOR:She walks with him.
12739,"LITTLEFINGER: Of course, Your Grace."
12740,CERSEI: I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crown's best interests at heart.
12741,LITTLEFINGER: I see. And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin?
12742,CERSEI: My father's a practical man. He appreciates facts.
12743,"LITTLEFINGER: Myself, I often find them a hindrance."
12744,"CERSEI: And he appreciates those who aid his family, as you well know. He's almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who don't. You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells. I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital."
12745,LITTLEFINGER: I shall do my best.
12746,CERSEI: Thank you. And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark?
12747,LITTLEFINGER: I assure you that it will.
12748,NARRATOR:CERSEI exits.
12749,"INT: King's Landing, Tyrion's chambers."
12750,NARRATOR:Podrick pours wine for Tyrion and Olenna.
12751,"OLENNA: Gods, boy, that's enough. We're not in a tavern."
12752,"PODRICK: Pardon, my lady."
12753,OLENNA: No need to speak. Are there any figs? Fetch some. I always take figs midafternoon. They help move the bowels. To what do I owe this summons?
12754,NARRATOR:PODRICK extis.
12755,"TYRION: Thank you for seeing me, my lady. I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters."
12756,OLENNA: I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters?
12757,TYRION: It's the royal wedding. I'm told you had a hand in planning it.
12758,OLENNA: Naturally.
12759,TYRION: It's shaping up to be a very involved affair. The word extravagant has been used.
12760,OLENNA: What good is the word extravagant if it can't be used to describe a royal wedding?
12761,TYRION: I understand that.
12762,OLENNA: Good.
12763,"TYRION: But, as Master of Coin, it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown. As of now, it's a huge expense."
12764,OLENNA: And?
12765,"TYRION: And we're at war, Lady Olenna."
12766,"OLENNA: Oh, I'd nearly forgotten."
12767,"TYRION: Yes, and maintaining supply lines--"
12768,"OLENNA: I can't think how it slipped my mind. What is it, 12,000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied? 2,000 in support. Provisions so this city might survive the winter. A million bushels of wheat. Half a million bushels each of barley, oats, and rye. 20,000 head of cattle. 50,000 sheep. You don't have to lecture me about wartime expenses. I'm quite familiar with them."
12769,TYRION: And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm.
12770,"OLENNA: As is a royal wedding. The people are hungry for more than just food. They crave distractions. And if we don't provide them, they'll create their own. And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces. A royal wedding is much safer. Wouldn't you say?"
12771,TYRION: I would.
12772,OLENNA: And traditionally paid for by the royal family.
12773,TYRION: (nods)
12774,NARRATOR:The door opens and PODRICK returns with figs.
12775,"OLENNA: I was told you were drunk, impertinent, and thoroughly debauched. You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper. Where did you go for them, Volantis?"
12776,TYRION: My lady--
12777,"OLENNA: Oh, very well. I won't have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part. We'll pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned. Is that sufficient?"
12778,TYRION: Quite sufficient. Thank you.
12779,"OLENNA: Very good, then. That's settled. Good day."
12780,"NARRATOR:TYRION and OLENNA stand, and she exits."

12787,ARYA: Why?
12788,GENDRY: I'm going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood.
12789,"ARYA: Have you lost your mind? When the Lannisters find this place, you think they'll spare the smiths? They'll cave your head in with your own helmet."
12790,GENDRY: The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood.
12791,ARYA: You don't have to do this.
12792,GENDRY: I want to. They need good men.
12793,"ARYA: Robb needs good men, too. We're leaving tomorrow. And then you--"
12794,"GENDRY: What? Serve him? I've served men my entire life. I served Master Mott at King's Landing and he sold me to the Watch. I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal, wondering every day if I'd get tortured or killed. I'm done serving."
12795,ARYA: You just said you were serving Lord Beric.
12796,"GENDRY: He may be their leader, but they chose him. These men are brothers. They're a family. I've never had a family."
12797,ARYA: I can be your family.
12798,GENDRY: You wouldn't be my family. You'd be 'my lady.

12804,WILLEM: Is this a rescue? Rickard KARSTARK: Lannister filth! Take him!

12810,"NARRATOR:Brynden opens the door.  RICKARD KARSTARK and his men walk in, hands bound."
12811,ROBB: Is that all of them? It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires?
12812,"RICKARD KARSTARK: Not murder, Your Grace. Vengeance."
12813,ROBB: Vengeance? Those boys didn't kill your sons. I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen--
12814,RICKARD KARSTARK: Was strangled by the Kingslayer. They were his kin.
12815,ROBB: They were boys! Look at them.
12816,RICKARD KARSTARK: Tell your mother to look at them. She killed them as much as I.
12817,ROBB: My mother had nothing to do with this. This was your treason.
12818,"RICKARD KARSTARK: It's treason to free your enemies. In war, you kill your enemies. Did your father not teach you that, boy?"
12819,NARRATOR:Brynden punches Rickard Karstark
12820,ROBB: Leave him.
12821,RICKARD KARSTARK: Aye. Leave me to the king. He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free. That's how he deals with treason. Our King in the North. Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North?
12822,ROBB: Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon. Hang the rest.
12823,"MAN: Mercy, sire! I didn't kill anyone. I only watched for the guards."
12824,ROBB: This one was only the watcher. Hang him last so he can watch the others die.
12825,"MAN: Please! Please, no. They made me do it! They made me! They made me!"
12826,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN takes out RICKARD KARSTARK and men. ROBB sits at his table. TALISA and EDMURE approach.
12827,EDMURE: Word of this can't leave Riverrun. They were Tywin Lannister's nephews. The Lannisters pay their debts. They never stop talking about it.
12828,ROBB: Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer?
12829,EDMURE: It wouldn't be lying. We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done.
12830,"ROBB: I'm not fighting for justice if I don't serve justice to murderers in my ranks, no matter how highborn. He has to die."
12831,NARRATOR:CATELYIN stands and approaches.
12832,CATELYN: The Karstarks are Northmen. They won't forgive the killing of their lord.
12833,"TALISA: Your mother's right. If you do this, the Karstarks will abandon you."
12834,ROBB: You tended to their wounds. You brought them supper. Now they're dead.
12835,TALISA: And more boys will keep dying until this war is over. You need Karstark men to end it.
12836,CATELYN: Spare his life. Keep him as a hostage.
12837,"EDMURE: A hostage. Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal, he will not be harmed."
12838,NARRATOR:ROBB coniders.
12839,"EXT: Riverrun gards, later. Rain pours down."
12840,NARRATOR:Men bring out the bound RICKARD KARSTARK. ROBB appraoches.
12841,ROBB: That didn't stop you from betraying me. And it won't save you now.
12842,RICKARD KARSTARK: I don't want it to save me. I want it to haunt you to the end of your days.
12843,"ROBB: Kneel, my lord."
12844,"NARRATOR:RICKARD KARSTARK willingly leans over the table, before ROBB, who holds a great sword,"
12845,"ROBB: Rickard Karstark, Lord of Karhold, here in sight of gods and men, I sentence you to die. Would you speak a final word?"
12846,RICKARD KARSTARK: Kill me and be cursed. You are no king of mine.
12847,"NARRATOR:ROBBB beheads RICKARD KARSTARK with a single great blow. He walks away, conflicted and frustrated."

12849,NARRATOR:ARYA stands by the fire. THOROS lies nearby.
12850,ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne. Ser Meryn. The Hound. What are you going to do with me?
12851,THOROS: At first light we'll ride for Riverrun. Your brother's there now. He'll make a contribution to our cause and you can go home.
12852,ARYA: I'm a hostage and you're selling me.
12853,THOROS: Don't think of it that way.
12854,ARYA: But it is that way.
12855,THOROS: It is. And it isn't.
12856,ARYA: More is than isn't.
12857,"THOROS: Beric admired your father a great deal, you know. He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether."
12858,ARYA: So why don't you?
12859,THOROS: We need the gold.
12860,NARRATOR:BERIC enters and sits. ARYA looks uncomfortable.
12861,"BERIC: Do I frighten you, child?"
12862,ARYA: No.
12863,BERIC: You're angry with me. And I don't blame you. But letting him go was the right thing. I have more reason than most to want him hanged.
12864,ARYA: I thought he killed you.
12865,BERIC: He did.
12866,ARYA: But how?
12867,BERIC: Thoros how many times have you brought me BACK?THOROS: It's the Lord of Light brings you back. I'm just the lucky drunk who says the words.
12868,BERIC: How many times?
12869,"THOROS: Five, I think. No, this makes six."
12870,BERIC: Six.
12871,NARRATOR:BERIC shows ARYA  the scar on his chest.
12872,BERIC: Then I was stabbed in the belly.
12873,THOROS: Then it was an arrow in the back. And that axe in the side.
12874,BERIC: Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason. Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye?
12875,THOROS: Both. Fuckers couldn't decide.
12876,"NARRATOR:BERIC shows ARYA his right eye, sewn shut behind his eye patch."
12877,THOROS: And the Hound makes six.
12878,BERIC: Second time I've been killed by a Clegane.
12879,"THOROS: You'd think you'd learn. It's not getting any easier, you know."
12880,"BERIC: I know. Every time I come back, I'm a bit less. Pieces of you get chipped away."
12881,ARYA: Could you bring back a man without a head? Not six times. Just once.
12882,"THOROS: I don't think it works that way, child."
12883,"BERIC: He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere. I would never wish my life upon him."
12884,ARYA: I would. You're alive.
12885,INT: Dragonstone.
12886,NARRATOR:SELYSE prays with palms open to a fire in a roughly hewn room.

12894,"STANNIS: Yes, of course."
12895,SELYSE: You mustn't despair. Your claim is true. You will be victorious.
12896,STANNIS: I believed that once.
12897,SELYSE: You are the one god's champion and the finest man I've ever known.
12898,STANNIS: Selyse. I've broken a sacred vow. I've sinned.
12899,SELYSE: No.
12900,STANNIS: I've wronged you. I have shamed you.
12901,SELYSE: You're doing god's work.
12902,"SELYSE: I know, Stannis. The Lady Melisandre has told me everything. No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin. When she told me, I wept with joy."
12903,"NARRATOR:SELYSE walks past STANNIS toward three specimen jars. Each contains a stillborn baby in a cloudy, green liquid."
12904,STANNIS: That's not true.
12905,SELYSE: So you've come to see her as well? There is no need. You must keep away from such distractions.

12919,NARRATOR:She pulls him to sit on the bed.
12920,SHIREEN: Mother said you fought in a battle. Did you win?

12922,SHIREEN: Did the Onion Knight come back with you?
12923,STANNIS: He did. He fought bravely.
12924,SHIREEN: He hasn't come to visit me. He said he'd bring me back a present from the capital.

12926,SHIREEN: Why not? He's my friend. Look.
12927,NARRATOR:SHIREEN gets up and opens a nearby drawer. She returns with a carved two-masted boat.
12928,SHIREEN: He made this for me. But don't tell Mother I have it. It's a secret. Mother doesn't like the Onion Knight.

12943,BRIENNE: Why should I care how you die?
12944,"JAIME: You swore a solemn vow, remember? You're supposed to get me to King's Landing in one piece. Not going so well, is it? No wonder Renly died with you guarding him."
12945,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE stands bold and naked, challenging JAIME to continue. He is shamed."
12946,JAIME: That was unworthy. Forgive me. You protected me better than most--

12954,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE stares wide-eyed, and doesn't answer."

12957,JAIME: Stark? You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
12958,"NARRATOR:JAIME tries to stand, but collapses into BRIENNE's arms."
12959,BRIENNE: Help! Help! The Kingslayer!

12966,DAVOS: Bert?
12967,NARRATOR:DAVOS comes to the bars to talk.
12968,SHIREEN: He's the fat one. He's on guard duty tonight. He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot.
12969,DAVOS: Go back to your room. You're not supposed to be here. If your father knew--
12970,SHIREEN: he said you Were a traitor. Are you?
12971,"DAVOS: I am, child. I disobeyed my king, your father, and now I'm paying the price."
12972,SHIREEN: I don't care. You're my friend. You must get bored down here. I brought you something to read. It's about Aegon and his dragons. Aegon used to live here. Did you know that? And the Targaryens built this castle.
12973,DAVOS: Aye. So they did.
12974,SHIREEN: You can hide the book under your cloak. It's a good one. I'll bring you more.
12975,"DAVOS: Thank you, my lady. I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me."
12976,SHIREEN: Take it. I have more.
12977,"DAVOS: My lady, I can't read the words."
12978,SHIREEN: You can't?
12979,DAVIS: (shakes his head no)

12981,DAVOS: No. No. No.
12982,SHIREEN: It's easy. It'll be fun.
12983,DAVOS: Go. We can't.
12984,"SHIREEN: Why not? What will they do, lock us in cells?"
12985,DAVOS: (laughs) I wouldn't know where to start.
12986,"SHIREEN: At the beginning. This word is Aegon. When you see A, E, and G together like that, it sounds like egg. And the title of the whole book is 'An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros.'"

12988,NARRATOR:Unsullied and Dothraki march across the landscape. DAENERYS rides up on a white horse. JORAH and BARRISTAN talk on their mounts nearby.
12989,JORAH: It was a bitch of a siege.
12990,"BARRISTAN: Mm, you were first through the breach at Pyke?"
12991,"JORAH: The second. Thoros of Myr went in alone, waving that flaming sword of his."
12992,BARRISTAN: Thoros of Myr. Bloody madman. Robert knighted you after the battle?
12993,"JORAH: Proudest moment of my life. One knee in the dust, the king's sword on my shoulder, listening to the words. 'In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave.' All I could think of was how badly I had to piss."
12994,BARRISTAN: (laughs)
12995,JORAH: In full plate metal for 16 hours. Never occurred to me till the fighting was over. I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the king's boots.
12996,NARRATOR:JORAH and BARRISTAN lead their horses to water.
12997,"BARRISTAN: Robert would have laughed. He was a good man, a great warrior. And a terrible king. I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings."
12998,JORAH: You swore an oath.
12999,"BARRISTAN: Yes. And a man of honor keeps his vows, even if he's serving a drunk or a lunatic. Just once in my life before it's over, I want to know what it's like to serve with pride, to fight for someone I believe in. Do you believe in her?"
13000,NARRATOR:BARRISTAN nods towards DAENERYS in the background.
13001,JORAH: With all my heart.
13002,CUT  TO: just ahead at the river.

13006,DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) You did not choose this life. But you are free men now. And free men make their own choices. Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks?
13007,"NARRATOR:The Unsullied part, revealing their chosen leader, GREY WORM"

13011,DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) What is your name?
13012,GREY WORM: (speaks Valyrian) Grey Worm.
13013,NARRATOR:Daenerys is confused.
13014,DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Grey Worm.
13015,"DAENERYS: (speaks Valeryan) From this day forward you will choose your own names. You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same. Throw away your slave name. Choose the name your parents gave you, or any other. A name that gives you pride."
13016,"GREY WORM: (speaks Valeryan) ""Grey Worm"" gives me pride. It is a very lucky name. The name this one was born with was cursed. That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave. But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free."
13017,CUT TO: Further back on the river.
13018,NARRATOR:JORAH and BARRISTAN lead their horses.
13019,JORAH: King Robert wanted her dead.
13020,BARRISTAN: Of course he wanted her dead. She's a Targaryen. The last Targaryen.
13021,JORAH: I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him.
13022,BARRISTAN: I didn't sit on the small council.
13023,JORAH: No? Doesn't the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally--
13024,"BARRISTAN: Traditionally, yes, but I killed a dozen of Robert's friends during his rebellion."
13025,NARRATOR:The mount their horses.
13026,BARRISTAN: He didn't want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King. Can't say I minded much. I always hated the politics.
13027,NARRATOR:They begin to ride alongside the marching Dothraki and Unsullied.
13028,BARRISTAN: Mm-hmm.
13029,"JORAH: Still, she'll have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms."
13030,"BARRISTAN: She'll have good men around her to advise her, men with experience."
13031,JORAH: Which men do you have in mind?
13032,"BARRISTAN: Forgive me, Ser Jorah, for what I'm about to say, but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years."
13033,JORAH: It suffered for a reason. I sold men into slavery.
13034,BARRISTAN: I don't know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home.
13035,"JORAH: Our cause? Forgive me, Ser Barristan, but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Robert's assassins while you were still bowing to the man."
13036,BARRISTAN: We both want her to rule. Am I wrong?
13037,JORAH: You only joined us a few days ago. I can't speak to your intentions.
13038,"BARRISTAN: If we're truly her loyal servants, we will do whatever needs to be done, no matter the cost, no matter our pride."
13039,JORAH: You're not Lord here. You're just another exile. And I take my orders from the queen.

13045,ROBB: The Karstarks are gone. Almost half our forces. Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel. Nothing. Only wait.
13046,TALISA: Don't let him.
13047,ROBB: What can I do? Attack King's Landing? There's nothing he'd like better. He'd crush us in a day.
13048,TALISA: We could ride north. Take your land back from the Greyjoys. Wait out the winter.
13049,"ROBB: Winter could last five years. Once my bannermen are home again, sitting by the fire, surrounded by their families, warm and safe, they'll never ride south again. When I gathered my lords together, we had a purpose, a mission. Now we're like a band of bickering children."
13050,TALISA: Give them a new purpose.
13051,ROBB: What?
13052,"TALISA: Oh, I don't know. I don't even know where Winterfell is."

13054,ROBB: Here. And we're here. King's Landing--
13055,NARRATOR:He pauses as a thought takes his mind.
13056,TALISA: What is it?
13057,"ROBB: I can't force them to meet us in the field and I can't attack them where they're strongest, but I can attack them where they're not."
13058,NARRATOR:ROBB moves one piece to take another on the map.
13059,ROBB: And Casterly Rock can't run away. I'm going to take their home away from them.

13065,MARGAERY:  I'll plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married. It should grow quickly.
13066,SANSA: Joffrey won't let me leave. He's got too many reasons to keep me here.

13096,SANSA: What is?
13097,"LITTLEFINGER: It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else. Your hair is different."
13098,SANSA: Is it?
13099,LITTLEFINGER: Lady Margaery wears it that way.
13100,SANSA: Many ladies wear it this way.
13101,LITTLEFINGER: I have good news. I'll be leaving the city soon.
13102,SANSA: You still want me to come with you?
13103,"LITTLEFINGER: It's not a question of what I want. It's what you want. You want to go home, don't you?"
13104,"SANSA: Of course. More than anything. But maybe it would be better to wait. I've been thinking how dangerous it would be. Not just for me, but for you. You've been so kind. I'd feel terrible if anything happened to you. I can't tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare."
13105,"LITTLEFINGER: I hope you know that I'm your friend, Sansa. Your true friend."

13122,TYRION: (to Cersei) Stop that. You're making me uncomfortable.
13123,TYWIN: Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras.

13125,TYWIN: Your jokes are not appreciated.
13126,"TYRION: It wasn't my best, but--"
13127,"TYWIN: I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me, by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me."
13128,TYRION: Sansa is the key to the North? I seem to remember she has an older brother.
13129,TYWIN: The Karstarks have marched home. The young wolf has lost half his army. His days are numbered. Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers. That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell. And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells.
13130,TYRION: The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war. Do you really think it's wise to refuse them?
13131,TYWIN: There's nothing to refuse. This is a plot. Plots are not public knowledge. And the Tyrells won't carry this one out until after Joffrey's wedding. We need to act first and kill this union in its crib.
13132,TYRION: And how do we do that?
13133,TYWIN: We find Sansa Stark a different husband.

13140,TYRION: She's a child!
13141,"CERSEI: She's flowered, I assure you. She and I have discussed it at length."
13142,"TYWIN: There, you see? You will wed her, bed her, and put a child in her. Surely you're capable of that."
13143,TYRION: And if I refuse?
13144,TYWIN: You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle. Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for. And it is past time you were wed.
13145,TYRION: I was wed. Or don't you remember?
13146,TYWIN: Only too well.
13147,CERSEI: You should be thanking the gods for this. This is more than you deserve.
13148,TYWIN: Tyrion will do as he's bid. As will you.
13149,CERSEI: What do you mean?
13150,TYWIN: You'll marry Ser Loras.

13254,"YGRITTE: 'Can we not talk about that here? I'm Jon Snow. I've killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand, but I'm scared of naked girls.'"
13255,JON: Did I seem scared the other day?
13256,YGRITTE: You were trembling like a leaf.
13257,JON: Only in the beginning.
13258,"YGRITTE: Only in the beginning. You're a proper lover, Jon Snow. And don't worry. Your secret's safe with me."
13259,JON: What secret?
13260,YGRITTE: Do you think I'm as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up? You're loyal and you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent.
13261,"NARRATOR:JON freezes. YGRITTE comes closer, furtively."
13262,"YGRITTE: But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down."
13263,NARRATOR:She moves to sit next to him.
13264,YGRITTE: It's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.
13265,JON: I won't.
13266,YGRITTE: 'Cause I'll cut your pretty cock right off and wear it 'round my neck.
13267,NARRATOR:TORMUND returns. He hands JON a climbing axe.
13268,"TORMUND: Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step. And if you fall, don't scream. You don't want that to be the last thing she remembers."
13269,"EXT: Riverlands Woods, the Brotherhood without Banners."
13270,"NARRATOR:ARYA practices with a bow, shooting arrows into a straw man. She says a name with each arrow she lets fly. ANGUY watches, while THOROS sit nearby, drinking."
13271,ARYA: Joffrey. Cersei. Ilyn Payne.
13272,ANGUY: You're good. You're not as good as you think you are.
13273,"ANGUY: Aye, but you took your sweet time of it. You won't be fighting straw men, little lady. Show me your position."
13274,NARRATOR:ARYA pulls back the bow and ANGUY corrects her form.
13275,ANGUY: Keep your elbow high. You want your back doing the hard labor. You're holding. Never hold.
13276,NARRATOR:ARYA lowers the bow.
13277,ARYA: What?
13278,ANGUY: Your muscles tense up when you hold. Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release. Never hold.
13279,ARYA: But I have to aim.
13280,ANGUY: Never aim.
13281,ARYA: Never aim?
13282,ANGUY: Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go. Trust your eye.
13283,NARRATOR:ARYA draws the bow.
13284,ARYA: There's someone out there.
13285,NARRATOR:A party of mounted travelers approaches. ANGUY takes the bow and meets them on the path.
13286,ANGUY: That's about far enough.
13287,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE lowers her red hood.
13288,MELISANDRE: We come as friends.
13289,"ANGUY: Begging your pardon, m'lady, but we'll be the judge of that."
13290,MELISANDRE: Valar morghulis.
13291,THOROS: Valar dohaeris. (speaks Valyrian) I don't see many priestesses of R'hollor in the Riverlands.
13292,MELISANDRE: (speaks Valyrian) You are Thoros of Myr.
13293,THOROS: (nods)
13294,MELISANDRE: (speaks Valyrian) The High Priest gave you a mission. Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light. What happened?
13295,THOROS: (speaks Valyrian) I failed.
13296,"MELISANDRE: (speaks Valyrian) You quit, you mean. The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk."
13297,"THOROS: (speaks Valyrian) You worship Him in your way, and I'll worship Him in mine. Do you speak the common tongue?"
13298,"THOROS: My friends here don't speak High Valyrian. Why are you here, my lady?"
13299,EXT: Brotherhood's caverns.
13300,NARRATOR:BERIC sits by the fire. MELISANDRE and THOROS enter. He stands.
13301,BERIC: Forgive my manners. I don't see many ladies these days.
13302,THOROS: Lucky for the ladies.
13303,"NARRATOR:Melisandre scans Beric, with both her eyes and her hand. She is fascinated by his scars."
13304,MELISANDRE: How many times has the Lord brought him back?
13305,THOROS: Six.
13306,MELISANDRE: (speaks Valerian) That's not possible.
13307,THOROS: (speaks Valerian) The Lord has smiled upon me.
13308,MELISANDRE: (speaks Valerian) You should not have this power.
13309,"THOROS: (speaks Valerian) I have no power. I ask the Lord for His favor, and He responds as He will."
13310,NARRATOR:THOROS sits and begins to drink again.
13311,"THOROS: I've always been a terrible priest. Drank too much rum. Fucked all the whores in King's Landing. It's a terrible thing to say, but by the time I came to Westeros, I didn't believe in our Lord. I decided that He, that all the gods, were stories we told the children to make them behave. So I wore the robes and every now and then I'd recite the prayers, but it was just for show. A spectacle for the locals. Until the Mountain drove a lance through this one's heart. I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words. Not because I believed in them, but he was my friend and he was dead. And they were the only words I knew. And for the first time in my life, the Lord replied. Beric's eyes opened and I knew the truth. Our god is the one true god. And all men must serve Him."
13312,MELISANDRE: You've been to the other side.
13313,"BERIC: The other side? There is no other side. I have been to the darkness, my lady. He sent you to us for a reason."
13314,MELISANDRE: You have someone He needs.
13315,CUT TO: The woods outside the cavern.
13316,NARRATOR:ANGUY hands an arrowhead to GENDRY.
13317,ANGUY: Bodkin point. Penetrates plate at 200 yards. Can you make 'em?
13318,"GENDRY: Yeah, nothing tricky about it. Just need decent steel."
13319,ANGUY: I'll get you the steel.
13320,MAN: Come on.
13321,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE and her men pass nearby, pulling a wagon."
13322,ARYA: I don't like that woman.
13323,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE, THOROS and BERIC approach."
13324,ANGUY: That's 'cause you're a girl.
13325,GENDRY: (laughs)
13326,ARYA: What does that have to do with anything?
13327,"BERIC: Forgive me, lad."
13328,NARRATOR:Two of MELISANDRE's guards grab and bind Gendry.
13329,ARYA: What are you doing? Let go of him.
13330,"NARRATOR:ARYA tries to intervene, but the guard pushes her away easily."
13331,ARYA: Tell them to stop. Come on. He wants to be one of you. He wants to join the Brotherhood. Stop them!
13332,BERIC: We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy.
13333,ARYA: Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she?
13334,NARRATOR:A GUARD returns from the horses with two sacks of gold. He hands them to BERIC. MELISANDRE walks away.
13335,ARYA: You're not doing this for your god. You're doing it for gold.
13336,"THOROS: We're doing it for both, girl. We can't defend the people without weapons and horses and food. And we can't get weapons and horses and food without gold."
13337,GENDRY: You told me this was a Brotherhood. You told me I could be one of you.
13338,MELISANDRE: You are more than they can ever be. They're just foot soldiers in the great war. You will make kings rise and fall.
13339,"NARRATOR:ARYA approaches MELISANDRE from behind, and spins her around from the elbow."
13340,ARYA: You're a witch. You're going to hurt him.
13341,NARRATOR:Melisandre grabs Arya's chin.
13342,NARRATOR:The wagon carrying GENDRY drives away.
13343,EXT: The wall.
13344,"NARRATOR:TORMUND, ORELL, YGRITTE, JON climb the wall. Three more wildlings lag behind. The wind howls and the snow swirls. They use ropes, pitons and axes. The climb is slow and arduous.  The height is  dizzying."
13345,"YGRITTE: You staring at my ass, Jon Snow?"
13346,"NARRATOR:JON smiles. Just above them, TORMUND's axe releases a cluster of ice from the wall."
13347,TORMUND: Look out!
13348,"NARRATOR:ORELL and YGRITTE dodge, but the falling ice hits JON in the face, and he loses his grip. His pitons gives way, and he slides helplessly down the wall until the slack of his rope is used up."
13349,YGRITTE: You all right?
13350,NARRATOR:JON begins to climb again.
13351,"TORMUND: Just seeing if you can take a hit, lad."
13352,"INT: A dungeon, somewhere."
13353,"NARRATOR:RAMSAY blows a horn, waking THEON, who is bound to the X-shaped cross."
13354,RAMSAY: Sorry. Were you sleeping?
13355,THEON: Wa--
13356,RAMSAY: Wa--? Wa--? Water? You want some water. I wish I had some for you.
13357,NARRATOR:RAMSAY holds up the mug from the table next to him. He slowly pours out the water to the floor. He rises and walks to THEON>
13358,THEON: (whimpering)
13359,RAMSAY: So let's play a game. Which body part do you need the least?
13360,THEON: Please.
13361,RAMSAY: Please is not a body part.
13362,"THEON: I'll tell you everything, please."
13363,"RAMSAY: But you've already told me everything. Remember? Your daddy was mean to you. The Starks didn't appreciate you. One good bit, though. The Stark boys, they're still alive. Wouldn't that be a hunt to remember? You failed, but I'm a better hunter than you."
13364,NARRATOR:Ramsay prods Theon.
13365,"RAMSAY: Now how about your little finger? You don't use that for much, do you? No? Good. Let's start with that."
13366,NARRATOR:RAMSAY works at the leather straps on THEON's right hand.
13367,THEON: (groans)
13368,"RAMSAY: You've been wondering why you're here. Haven't you? Where you are. Who I am. Why I'm doing this to you. So guess. If you guess right, I'll tell you. By the old gods and the new, I swear it. You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why I'm torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger."
13369,"THEON: If I win, you'll let me go?"
13370,"RAMSAY: If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention."
13371,THEON: Please.
13372,NARRATOR:RAMSAY draws a knife brandishes just before THEON's chin.
13373,RAMSAY: You say please again and you'll wish you hadn't. You first. Where are we?
13374,THEON: The North.
13375,RAMSAY: Too vague.
13376,THEON: Deepwood Motte.
13377,RAMSAY: Terrible guess.
13378,NARRATOR:RAMSAY tortures THEON by stabbing his right pinky. THEON cries out.
13379,"RAMSAY: Now, where?"
13380,THEON: Last Hearth.
13381,RAMSAY: Do I look like a fucking Umber to you?
13382,"NARRATOR:This time, RAMSAY holds the knife in THEON's pinky for much longer."
13383,THEON: Karhold!
13384,NARRATOR:RAMSAY stops.
13385,RAMSAY: Karhold? How did you know that? Did you see any banners flying when we came in?
13386,THEON: No. It was just a guess.
13387,"RAMSAY: Very good, Lord Theon. And who am I?"
13388,THEON: Torrhen Karstark.
13389,RAMSAY: He's dead. Strangled by the Kingslayer.
13390,THEON: He was your brother. Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark.
13391,NARRATOR:RAMSAY walks away.
13392,THEON: You swore to tell me if I--
13393,RAMSAY: You're right.
13394,THEON: Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Stark's bannerman. I betrayed Robb. That's why you're torturing me.
13395,RAMSAY: Yes. You win.
13396,"NARRATOR:THEON is relieved. RAMSAY looks dejected. But get rises suddenly, full of energy."
13397,"RAMSAY: Of course, you forgot to ask one question. You forgot to ask if I'm a liar."
13398,NARRATOR:Ramsay tortures Theon by twisting his knife in the tip of THEON's pinky.
13399,THEON: (screams louder than before)
13400,RAMSAY: I'm afraid I am.
13401,NARRATOR:RAMSAY squeezes THEON's pinkie.
13402,RAMSAY: Everything I told you is a lie.
13403,NARRATOR:RAMSAY continues to punish THEON's pinky.
13404,THEON: (screams in desperation)
13405,NARRATOR:The torture continues.
13406,"THEON: Please, cut it off! Cut it off! Cut it off!"
13407,NARRATOR:RAMSAY stops and stands before THEON. He smiles.
13408,RAMSAY: I win.
13409,INT: Riverrun Great Hall
13410,"NARRATOR:Robb, Catelyn, Brynden, Edmure, Black Walder and Lothar sit around a large table."
13411,ROBB: Thank you for riding here so quickly. I know travel isn't easy in these times.
13412,"BLACK WALDER: The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits. But when the King of the North summons us, we come."
13413,LOTHAR: Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met. Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters.
13414,"ROBB: Of course. He deserves as much. I was in the wrong.  Black WALDER: As restitution for this betrayal, he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands."
13415,EDMURE: I don't think that's--
13416,ROBB: We are fighting for the North. Harrenhal is not in the North. It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it.
13417,BLACK WALDER: And there's something else.
13418,ROBB: We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs.
13419,"BLACK WALDER: Not what, whom."
13420,NARRATOR:BLACK WALDER looks at EDMURE.
13421,EDMURE: What?
13422,"NARRATOR:BRYDEN, ROBB and LOTHAR also stare at. EDMURE."
13423,EDMURE: (chuckles) No.
13424,EDMURE: How old is she?
13425,LOTHAR: 19
13426,EDMURE: Could I see her first?
13427,BLACK WALDER: You want to count her teeth? We depart for the Twins in the morning. We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end.
13428,BRYNDEN: Your father does realize we're in the middle of a war?
13429,LOTHAR: Father is old. It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband.  Black WALDER: And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements.
13430,ROBB: He has every right to be. Please excuse us while we discuss it.
13431,NARRATOR:LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER exit.
13432,"EDMURE: Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me? At the very least, I should be offered the same choice you were. I'm his liege lord."
13433,NARRATOR:EDMURE stands.
13434,ROBB: He's a proud man and we've wounded him.
13435,EDMURE: I didn't wound him. My answer is no.
13436,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN stands and walks to EDMURE.
13437,BRYNDEN: Listen to me and listen very carefully. You--
13438,EDMURE: The laws of gods and men are very clear. No man can compel another man to marry.
13439,BRYNDEN: The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth.
13440,"ROBB: It's all right. You heard him. If you refuse, our alliance with the Freys is dead."
13441,NARRATOR:BRYDEN sits.
13442,"EDMURE: He's wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12. He's not gonna stop wanting it now. When I say no, he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing."
13443,CATELYN: You're willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife?
13444,ROBB: I have a war to fight. We can't win it without them. I have no time to haggle. You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill.
13445,BRYNDEN: You recall that heroic engagement?
13446,EDMURE: I had something less permanent in mind.
13447,"ROBB: I've won every battle, but I'm losing this war. If we don't do this and do it now, we're lost."
13448,EDMURE: I'll marry her.
13449,"ROBB: You're paying for my sins, Uncle. It's not fair or right. I'll remember it."
13450,INT: Harenhall dining room
13451,"NARRATOR:JAIME struggles to feed himself one-handed. BRIENNE sits next to him in a gown, and ROOSE sits across from them both."
13452,ROOSE BOLTON: I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear.
13453,"BRIENNE: Yes. Most kind of them. You're a Stark bannerman, Lord Bolton. I am acting on Lady Stark's orders to return Jaime Lannister to King's Landing.  Roose BOLTON: When King Robb left Harrenhal, his mother was his prisoner. If she wasn't his mother, he'd have hanged her for treason."
13454,NARRATOR:Brienne stabs Jaime's steak so that he has leverage to cut it.
13455,ROOSE BOLTON: I should send you back to Robb Stark.
13456,"JAIME: You should. But instead, you're sitting here watching me fail at dinner. Why might that be?"
13457,ROOSE BOLTON: Wars cost money. Many people would pay a great deal for you.
13458,JAIME: We both know who would pay the most. Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution.
13459,ROOSE BOLTON: You're right. Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies.
13460,"JAIME: It would be, if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it."
13461,ROOSE BOLTON: King Robb is keeping your father quite busy. He doesn't have time for anything else.
13462,JAIME: He'll make time for you.
13463,"ROOSE BOLTON: As soon as you're well enough to travel, I will allow you to go to King's Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made. And you will swear to tell your father the truth, that I had nothing to do with your maiming."
13464,NARRATOR:JAIME nods and reaches for a pitcher.
13465,JAIME: Shall we drink on it?
13466,"NARRATOR:JAIME begins to pour, but ROOSE stops him."
13467,ROOSE BOLTON: I don't partake.
13468,JAIME: You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people?
13469,NARRATOR:JAIME pours wine for BRIENNE and himself.
13470,"JAIME: Very well. My lady, may our journey continue without further incident."
13471,"ROOSE BOLTON: Oh, she won't be going with you."
13472,BRIENNE: I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to--
13473,ROOSE BOLTON: You are charged with abetting treason.
13474,JAIME: I'm afraid I must insist.
13475,ROOSE BOLTON: You're in no place to insist on anything. I would have hoped you'd learned your lesson about overplaying your position.
13476,"INT: King's Landing, Tywin's chambers."
13477,OLENNA: Impossible.
13478,NARRATOR:TYWIN pours some wine.
13479,TYWIN: Why?
13480,OLENNA: My grandson is the pride of Highgarden. The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms. Your daughter--
13481,"TYWIN: Is rich, the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king."
13482,NARRATOR:TYWIN hands a glass to OLENNA.
13483,OLENNA: Old.
13484,TYWIN: Old?
13485,"OLENNA: Old. I'm something of an expert on the subject. Her change will be upon her before long. I'll spare you the details of what will happen then. You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter, but this is another matter entirely."
13486,"TYWIN: The years punish us as well, I promise you that. My stomach remains quite strong, however. The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandson's nocturnal activities. Do you deny them?"
13487,"OLENNA: Oh, not at all. A sword swallower through and through."
13488,TYWIN: And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name.
13489,"OLENNA: Did you grow up with boy cousins, Lord Tywin? Sons of your father's bannermen, squires, stable boys?"
13490,TYWIN: Of course.
13491,OLENNA: And you never--
13492,TYWIN: No.
13493,OLENNA: Not once? Not in any way?
13494,TYWIN: Never.
13495,"OLENNA: I congratulate you upon your restraint. But it's a natural thing, two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets."
13496,TYWIN: Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior.
13497,TYWIN: I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it.
13498,"NARRATOR:TYWIN stands, offended. He pours himself more wine."
13499,"OLENNA: Lie or not, you must admit many people find it quite convincing. Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation."
13500,TYWIN: I don't care what people believe. And neither do you.
13501,NARRATOR:OLENNA refuses TYWIN's offer for more wine.
13502,"OLENNA: As an authority on myself, I must disagree."
13503,"TYWIN: Now, if the rumors about my children were true, then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt."
13504,"OLENNA: And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children, we're throwing another prized flower into the dirt. It is a chance we simply cannot take."
13505,TYWIN: The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable. All right. I'll remove it for you.
13506,NARRATOR:TYWIN sits back down at his desk.
13507,"TYWIN: If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei, I will name him to the Kingsguard. I'm sure you're familiar with the Kingsguard vows. He will never marry. He will never have children."
13508,OLENNA: Oh
13509,TYWIN: The Tyrell name will fade. And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery.
13510,OLENNA: You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you?
13511,"TYWIN: I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously. So, shall I draw up the order? Or do you consent to this marriage?"
13512,"NARRATOR:TYWIN takes up a quill and prepares to write. OLENNA stands, and takes the quill from his hand."
13513,NARRATOR:OLENNA snaps the quill.
13514,EXT: The Wall.
13515,"NARRATOR:The weather has worsened for the climbers. They shout to be heard over the howling winds. Each blow of the axe takes great strength to penetrate the ice. YGRITTE buries her axe in the wall, but a great crack opens across it. The ice wall cracks and pops to her right as the fissure travels across it. Suddenly, a huge swath of the wall gives way, taking three wildlings with it. They scream amidst the roar."
13516,ORELL: No!
13517,"NARRATOR:ORELL digs his axe deep into the wall. TORMUND does the same, bracing himself in a wide stance. The wall under YGRITTE and JON gives way and they falls amid an avalanche of ice and snow."
13518,YGRITTE: (screams)
13519,NARRATOR:TORMUND prepares for the force of their fall on the rope that tethers them together.
13520,TORMUND: (grunts)
13521,YGRITTE: (screams)
13522,JON: (screams)
13523,"NARRATOR:ORELL loses his grip on the wall. He dangles, trying to gain purchase with his climbing axe. TORMUND holds on as best he can."
13524,TORMUND: (grunts)
13525,ORELL: We've gotta cut them loose!
13526,TORMUND: No!
13527,"NARRATOR:ORELL unsheathes his knife and begins to saw at the rope that connects him to YGRITTE and JON. They hang and dangle helplessly far from the wall, swinging back and forth. ORELL continues to cut through the rope. JON finally swings far enough to plant his axe in solid ice. At the same moment, ORELL cuts through the rope and YGRITTE plummets, limbs spinning. Her fall halts when the rope to JON goes taught."
13528,JON: (grunts)
13529,YGRITTE: (screams)
13530,JON: (grunts)
13531,YGRITTE: (screams)
13532,NARRATOR:Jon tries to quiet the rope beneath him. YGRITTE hacks her axe into the wall. She climbs up to JON. He reaches out his hand.
13533,JON: Take my hand!
13534,"NARRATOR:They strain to connect, then clasp hands. JON pulls YGRITTE up to safety. They embrace, panting and exhausted. JON looks up to the sneering ORELL. They all begin to climb again."
13535,EXT: King's Landing garden.
13536,NARRATOR:SANSA and LORAS sit by a garden pool.
13537,SANSA: That's a wonderful pin.
13538,"LORAS: Oh, it's more of a brooch, really. Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin, so"
13539,SANSA:  I'm very happy about
13540,"LORAS: Uh, yes. I-I am as well."
13541,SANSA: I feel like I'm in a dream.
13542,"LORAS: Yes, me, too. Definitely. I've dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young. The guests, the food, the tournaments. And the bride, of course. The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves. Have you ever been to Highgarden, my lady?"
13543,SANSA: No. I had never left Winterfell before I came to King's Landing. But it sounds wonderful. I can't wait to see it. And to leave this place.
13544,"LORAS: It's terrible, isn't it? The most terrible place there is."
13545,NARRATOR:LORAS stands and  takes Sansa's hand to lead her away
13546,CUT TO: Garden overlook.
13547,NARRATOR:TYRION and CERSEI watch SANSA and LORAS from afar.
13548,TYRION: I don't suppose there's anything we can do about this.
13549,CERSEI: We can have them both killed.
13550,TYRION: It's hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement. Probably Sansa. Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery.
13551,CERSEI: Father doesn't discriminate. We're all being shipped off to hell together.
13552,NARRATOR:They move inside and CERSEI sits.
13553,TYRION: On a boat you built.
13554,CERSEI: The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family. I did what I did to protect our family.
13555,TYRION: I'm your family. A member of your family who has actively contributed to that family's survival. Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it.
13556,"CERSEI: I do admit it. If it weren't for your trick with the wildfire, Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here. Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate."
13557,TYRION: Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you. There are two people in King's Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard. Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater?
13558,NARRATOR:Cersei doesn't answer.
13559,"TYRION: The impulse I understand. He hates me because I'm the only one who tells him what he really is. So, fair enough. He wants me dead. But his stupidity? He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known. But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army. The boy's an idiot."
13560,CERSEI: What do you want me to say?
13561,TYRION: I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger.
13562,CERSEI: Probably. But not from Joffrey. He won't do anything now Father's here.
13563,TYRION: Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister.
13564,"CERSEI: Not the Tyrells. Soon they won't need to be afraid of him. Joffrey will belong to Margaery, the little doe-eyed whore. And so will his children and their children. History will be taken from our hands."
13565,"TYRION: You may escape, at least. Once Jaime gets back, Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels."
13566,"CERSEI: When Jaime gets back, yes. But when do we think that's going to be? He's out there somewhere."
13567,"TYRION: Jaime or not, I'm truly fucked."
13568,CERSEI: Who's going to tell her?
13569,INT: Sansa's chambers.
13570,NARRATOR:SHAE helps SANSA with her dress.
13571,SANSA: Do you think people will like it?
13572,SHAE: I don't think they will even notice it.
13573,"SANSA: You're right. It's not my wedding. Anyway, from what I can tell, the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in King's Landing. They'd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding. Loras likes green and gold brocade."
13574,SHAE: I'm sure he does.
13575,SANSA: Will they let me invite my family?
13576,SHAE: They haven't asked my opinion.
13577,SANSA: But do you think they will?
13578,SHAE: No.
13579,NARRATOR:The door opens.
13580,"MAID: Lady Sansa, Lord Tyrion to see you. Should I--"
13581,"NARRATOR:TYRION enters, catching SANSA partially dressed."
13582,"TYRION: I beg your pardon, my lady."
13583,NARRATOR:SHAE helps SANSA to recover her decency.
13584,"SANSA: Good afternoon, Lord Tyrion. I was just trying on a gown for King Joffrey's wedding."
13585,"TYRION: Yes, it should be quite a wedding. I need to speak with you, Lady Sansa."
13586,SANSA: Of course.
13587,"TYRION: Alone, if I may."
13588,SHAE: Why do you need to speak to her alone?
13589,"SANSA: Shae. Please excuse her, Lord Tyrion. She's not from here. But I trust her, even though she tells me not to."
13590,TYRION: Sometimes we think we want to hear something and it's only afterwards when it's too late that we realize we wished we'd heard it under entirely different circumstances.
13591,"SANSA: It's all right, really."
13592,NARRATOR:TYRION closes the door.
13593,INT: The Throne Room
13594,NARRATOR:VARYS and LITTLEFINGER look at the Iron Throne.
13595,"VARYS: 1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegon's fallen enemies, forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread."
13596,LITTLEFINGER: There aren't There aren't even 200. I've counted.
13597,"VARYS: Ha, I'm sure you have. Ugly old thing. Yet it has a certain appeal. The Lysa Arryn of chairs. Shame you had to settle for your second choice."
13598,"LITTLEFINGER: Early days, my friend. It is flattering, really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want."
13599,"VARYS: Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition, I promise you. Although who doesn't like to see their friends fail now and then?"
13600,"LITTLEFINGER: You're so right. For instance, when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells. If I'm going to be honest, I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there. But your confidant, the one who fed you information about my plans, the one you swore to protect, you didn't bring her any enjoyment. And she didn't bring me any enjoyment. She was a bad investment on my part. Luckily, I have a friend who wanted to try something new. Something daring. And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience."
13601,VARYS: I did what I did for the good of the realm.
13602,LITTLEFINGER: The realm? Do you know what the realm is? It's the thousand blades of Aegon's enemies. A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that it's a lie.
13603,VARYS: But what do we have left once we abandon the lie? Chaos. A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all.
13604,LITTLEFINGER: Chaos isn't a pit. Chaos is a ladder.
13605,CUT TO: Joffrey's chambers
13606,"NARRATOR:Joffrey sits pensively with his crossbow. He stands and walks out, past the bloodied corpse of Ros. Her hands are tied above her head, and she is pierced by multiple crossbow bolts."
13607,LITTLEFINGER: (voice over) Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.
13608,CUT TO: King's Landing Garden
13609,"NARRATOR:Sansa and Shae watch a boat sail away from King's Landing. Sansa weeps hopelessly. Shae is sad, but resolute."
13610,"LITTLEFINGER: (voice over) And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
13611,EXT: The top of the Wall
13612,"NARRATOR:YGRITTE pulls herself over the lip of the wall, exhausted. TORMUND and ORELL have already crested. TORMUND pulls up more supplies while ORELL looks through their provisions. YGRITTE doesn't have the strength to stand. JON pulls himself up as well, and collapses beside her. Above them, the sun breaks through the clouds. YGRITTE and JON prop themselves up and look across the northlands. It is beautiful. JON stands and helps YGRITTE up. The sun lights up the wall. JON leads YGRITTE to look at the southern side of the wall. The land is green and lush. They embrace and kiss."
13613,EXT: The North
13614,"NARRATOR:Just south of the wall, the wildlings march across the green expanse of the North."
13615,YGRITTE: How far are we?
13616,"JON:  About a week, I think."
13617,YGRITTE: You think? You don't know?
13618,"JON:  When we went to Castle Black, we took the kingsroad."
13619,NARRATOR:JON and YGRITTE sit. She adjusts her boots.
13620,YGRITTE: You and your roads. Is that how you lot do your fighting?  You march down the road banging drums and waving banners?
13621,"JON:  Most of the time, yes."
13622,YGRITTE: How do the men holding the banners fight?
13623,"JON:  They don't, really. It's a great honor to carry your house sigil."
13624,JON:  Usually it's the young boys banging the drums.
13625,YGRITTE: So what good are they?
13626,JON: They help the men march.
13627,YGRITTE: How?
13628,NARRATOR:YGRITTE stands up and play-acts a silly march.
13629,"YGRITTE: Oh, you mean right foot, left foot, right foot, left foot, right foot? You need help remembering that? When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black, we won't be banging on drums to let them know we're coming."
13630,"JON: No. No, you're just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know you're coming."
13631,"YGRITTE: You know nothing, Jon Snow."
13632,NARRATOR:YGRITTE leaves and ORELL catches up with JON.
13633,"ORELL: She's right, you don't."
13634,JON: I know you cut me loose on the Wall.
13635,"ORELL: Cut her loose, too. Do you see her sulking about it? That's because she understands the way things are."
13636,JON: And are you gonna share it with me? The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird?
13637,"ORELL:  People work together when it suits them. They're loyal when it suits them. They love each other when it suits them. And they kill each other when it suits them. She knows that, you don't. Which is why you'll never hold onto her."
13638,NARRATOR:ORELL continues on. JON follows behind.
13639,"INT: Riverrun, ROBB's chambers at night"

13641,BRYNDEN: That rain will cost us another day.
13642,ROBB: Frey will wait. He knows we're coming.
13643,CATELYN: Lord Walder is prickly by nature.
13644,BRYNDEN: Prickly?  That what you call it? Might be the least pleasant man I've ever met.
13645,"CATELYN: Yes, and that is why--"
13646,"BRYNDEN: I've seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey. Apologies, Your Grace. Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen."
13647,"TALISA: I've spent the last two years nursing wounded men, watching them bleed and die. I'm not afraid of wet shits."
13648,BRYNDEN: (laughs)
13649,CATELYN: Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight.
13650,EDMURE: He can take it as he likes. He's getting the wedding he wanted.
13651,CATELYN:  He's getting a wedding. It was a king he wanted.
13652,ROBB: Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house. We should all get some sleep.
13653,"NARRATOR:BRYNDEN, CATELYN and EDMURE leave. ROBB and TALISA kiss. CATELYN turns back to watch before she exits."

13659,ROBB: Who are you writing?
13660,TALISA:  My mother.
13661,ROBB: Is that Valyrian?
13662,TALISA: Gaaa.
13663,ROBB: Gaaa? (sighs) Say hello for me.
13664,TALISA: Rytsas.
13665,ROBB: 'Ritsas.'
13666,TALISA: That was close enough.
13667,ROBB: Does she know her daughter's a queen?
13668,TALISA:  Not yet.
13669,"ROBB: That will be a surprise, I expect."
13670,TALISA: Many surprises for her.
13671,ROBB: How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?
13672,TALISA:  Will you come with me one day to Volantis?  When all this is over?
13673,ROBB:  I will.
13674,TALISA: I promise. I know she'd love to meet you. And her grandchild.
13675,"ROBB: What, now?  Are you certain?"
13676,NARRATOR:ROBB stands.
13677,TALISA:  Are you angry with me?
13678,NARRATOR:ROBB caresses her face. She grabs hold.
13679,ROBB:  Angry? You're my queen.
13680,TALISA: And I have your little prince or princess inside me.
13681,ROBB: Maybe one of each.
13682,TALISA: Don't get greedy.
13683,NARRATOR:TALISA kisses ROBB's hand.
13684,TALISA: Can you leave the war for one night?

13691,TORMUND: Most men fuck like dogs.
13692,"NARRATOR:TORMUND demonstrates for JON with pelvic thrusts into his pack. YGRITTE sits nearby, disapproving."
13693,"TORMUND: No grace, no skill. A few dozen thrusts and done. You need to be patient. Give her time. Your cock shouldn't go near her till she's slick as a baby seal. And then you go inside, but slowly. Don't jam it in like you're spearing a pig. (laughts) Come on! Hey, come on."
13694,"NARRATOR:Tormund gives Jon a playful jab and walks off. JON gets up and follows, along with YGRITTE and ORELL."

13696,NARRATOR:The wildings march.
13697,"ORELL: You think he loves you, is that it? What did he tell you? He's gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle?"
13698,"YGRITTE:  No, he didn't tell me anything. He barely talks."
13699,"ORELL: I've seen you two whispering in the night, giggling like a pair of girls."
13700,"YGRITTE: What, you're jealous?"
13701,ORELL:  Of course I'm jealous. You should be with one of your own.
13702,YGRITTE: And you're one of my own? I've never heard a kind word from your mouth.
13703,NARRATOR:ORELL stops her.
13704,ORELL: You would if you were mine. I'd tell you that you're beautiful and fierce and wild. I'd be good to you. You love him?
13705,YGRITTE: (nods)
13706,ORELL:  'Cause he's pretty?  Is that it? You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes? You think pretty is gonna make you happy?
13707,"NARRATOR:YGRITTE tries to walk, but ORELL stops her."
13708,YGRITTE:  Don't touch me.

13715,NARRATOR:MARGAERY picks a rose.
13716,MARGAERY: You would have been happy at Highgarden. But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances.

13725,SANSA: He's a Lannister.
13726,"MARGAERY: Far from the worst Lannister, wouldn't you say?"
13727,SANSA:  I'm sorry. Here I am complaining to you.
13728,"MARGAERY: My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers. I plan to teach mine a great deal. And your son, if I'm not mistaken, your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday. What?"
13729,MARGAERY: If it's the pain you're worried about--
13730,SANSA: I'm not afraid of the pain. Not after what Joffrey's done to me.
13731,"MARGAERY: What is it, then? He's rather good-looking even with the scar. Especially with the scar."
13732,"MARGAERY: Some women like tall men. Some like short men. Some like hairy men. Some like bald men. Gentle men, rough men, ugly men, pretty men, pretty girls. Most women don't know what they like until they've tried it. And, sadly, so many of us get to try so little before we're old and gray. Tyrion may surprise you. From what I've heard, he's quite experienced."
13733,SANSA: And that's a good thing?
13734,"MARGAERY:  It can be. We're very complicated, you know. Pleasing us takes practice."
13735,SANSA: How do you know all this? Did your mother teach you?
13736,NARRATOR:MARGAERY takes SANSA's arm.
13737,"MARGAERY:  Yes, sweet girl. My mother taught me."

13745,BRONN: How much older?
13746,TYRION:  Older.
13747,"BRONN: You're a lord, she's a lady. And a beauty at that. I don't see the problem."
13748,TYRION: Shae isn't going to like it.
13749,BRONN: Shae is a whore. Are you gonna marry her? Eh? How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time?
13750,TYRION:  I should never have told you about that.
13751,"BRONN: You want Shae, keep her. Wed one and bed the other. All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl. He'll be Lord of Winterfell one day. You can rule the North in his name. You'll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own."
13752,TYRION: Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them.
13753,NARRATOR:BRONN pours more wine for them both.
13754,"BRONN: You waste time trying to get people to love you, you'll end up the most popular dead man in town. (chuckles) You want to fuck that Stark girl. You just don't want to admit it."
13755,TYRION: I don't pay you to put evil notions in my head. The ones already there don't need company.

13761,JOFFREY: Grandfather.
13762,TYWIN: You wanted to speak to me?
13763,JOFFREY:  Yes. I'd like a report on the meetings of my small council.
13764,"TYWIN: You're welcome to attend the meetings of your small council, Your Grace. Any or all of them."
13765,JOFFREY: I've been very busy. Many important matters require a king's attention.
13766,TYWIN: Of course.
13767,JOFFREY: You've been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber.
13768,"TYWIN: I have, yes."
13769,JOFFREY: May I ask why?
13770,"TYWIN:  The Tower of the Hand is where I work. To walk from there to here would take time, time I could otherwise spend productively."
13771,"JOFFREY: So if I wanted to attend a council meeting, I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand?"
13772,NARRATOR:TYWIN approaches and stands over JOFFREY.
13773,TYWIN:  We could arrange to have you carried.
13774,JOFFREY: Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons.
13775,TYWIN: Where did you hear about this?
13776,JOFFREY: Is it true?
13777,TYWIN: Apparently so.
13778,JOFFREY: Don't you think we ought to do something about it?
13779,"TYWIN:  When I was Hand of the King under your father's predecessor, the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room. The skull of the last of them was right here. It was the size of an apple."
13780,JOFFREY: And the biggest was the size of a carriage.
13781,"TYWIN: Yes, and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago. Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us."
13782,JOFFREY: But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel?
13783,TYWIN:  Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing.
13784,JOFFREY: But I haven't been counseled.
13785,TYWIN: You are being counseled at this very moment.
13786,JOFFREY: I should be consulted about such things.
13787,"TYWIN: From now on, I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary. Your Grace."

13793,"JORAH: On the field, with ease. But they won't meet us on the field. They have provisions, patience, and strong walls. If they're wise, they'll hide behind those walls and chip away at us, man by man."
13794,DAENERYS: I don't want half my army killed before I've crossed the Narrow Sea.
13795,"JORAH: We don't need Yunkai, khaleesi. Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne."
13796,DAENERYS: How many slaves are there in Yunkai?
13797,"JORAH:  200,000 if not more."
13798,"DAENERYS: Then we have 200,000 reasons to take the city."
13799,"DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) Send a man to the city gates. Tell the slavers I will receive them here, and accept their surrender. Otherwise, Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor.  GREY WORM: (nods)"

He surveys the Unsullied who speckle the rough landscape. The chains of the slaves who bear his load rattle as they walk. More slaves bear  ornate chests as they walk. They reach the camp where DAENERYS waits to receive them, with BARRISTAN, JORAH and her dragons at her side. The slaves lower the palaquin. RADZAL MO ERAZ steps out and is greeted by MISSANDEI."

13805,"MISSANDEI: Noble lord, you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, Breaker of Chains, and Mother of Dragons."
13806,DAENERYS: You may approach. Sit.

13810,"NARRATOR:MISSANDEI pours him some wine. RADZAL MO ERAZ drinks, never taking his eyes from DAENERYS."
13811,"RADZAL MO ERAZ:  Ancient and glorious is Yunkai. Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria. Many an army has broken against our walls. You shall find no easy conquest here, khaleesi."
13812,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS tosses a raw steak in the air. The three dragons launch after it, screeching as they jockey and circle in flight.  RADZAL MO ERAZ recoils in trepidation."
13813,DAENERYS: Good. My Unsullied need practice. I was told to blood them early.
13814,"RADZAL MO ERAZ: If blood is your desire, blood shall flow. But why? 'Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor. But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people."
13815,NARRATOR:He claps twice to signal his slaves. They bring forth the two chests.
13816,RADZAL MO ERAZ: The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen.
13817,NARRATOR:The slaves place the chests before DAENERYS and open their lids. The chests are filled with gold ingots. The slaves retreat and bow deeply before her in reverence.

13819,DAENERYS: My ship?
13820,"RADZAL MO ERAZ: Yes, khaleesi. As I said, we are a generous people. You shall have as many ships as you require."
13821,DAENERYS: And what do you ask in return?
13822,RADZAL MO ERAZ:  All we ask is that you make use of these ships. Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace.
13823,DAENERYS: I have a gift for you as well. Your life.
13824,RADZAL MO ERAZ: My life?
13825,"DAENERYS:  And the lives of your wise masters. But I also want something in return. You will release every slave in Yunkai. Every man, woman, and child shall be given as much food, clothing, and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude. Reject this gift, and I shall show you no mercy."
13826,"RADZAL MO ERAZ: You are mad. We are not Astapor or Qarth. We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends. Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you. Those who survive, we shall enslave once more. Perhaps we'll make a slave of you as well."
13827,NARRATOR:RADZAL MO ERAZ stands quickly. Drogon screeches angrily from his perch in warning.
13828,RADZAL MO ERAZ: You swore me safe conduct.
13829,"DAENERYS: I did, but my dragons made no promises. And you threatened their mother."
13830,RADZAL MO ERAZ: Take the gold.
13831,NARRATOR:The slaves rise and cautiously approach the open chests. The dragons refuse their approach with aggressive screeching. The slaves retreat in fear.
13832,"DAENERYS: My gold. You gave it to me, remember? And I shall put it to good use. You'd be wise to do the same with my gift to you. Now get out."

13834,NARRATOR:RADZAL MO ERAZ turns and stomps off.
13835,BARRISTAN: The Yunkish are a proud people. They will not bend.
13836,DAENERYS: And what happens to things that don't bend? He said he had powerful friends. Who was he talking about?
13837,JORAH:  I don't know.
13838,DAENERYS: Find out.

13851,TYRION:  I didn't ask for this marriage. I didn't want it.
13852,SHAE: No?  She's a beautiful girl. You said so yourself.
13853,"TYRION: That doesn't mean that--this is duty, not desire."
13854,SHAE: Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her?
13855,TYRION:  I don't have a choice. My father--
13856,SHAE: Does not rule the world. We can still go across the Narrow Sea.
13857,TYRION: What would I do there? Juggle? I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock.
13858,SHAE: And I'm Shae the funny whore.
13859,TYRION: My feelings for you have not changed. I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her.
13860,SHAE: While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when you're bored?
13861,TYRION:  I swear to you it will not be like that.
13862,SHAE: No? What will it be like?
13863,"TYRION:  I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city. You will have fine clothes, guards to keep you safe, servants. Any children we might have will be well provided for."
13864,SHAE: Children? You think I want children who can never see their father? Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them?

13866,"TYRION:  Listen. Listen to me, my lady."

13880,MELISANDRE: Haven't you ever wondered where your strength came from? Your talent for fighting?
13881,GENDRY:  I'm lowborn. As low as can be. My mother was a tavern wench.

13887,GENDRY: I'm just a bastard.
13888,"MELISANDRE: The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men. Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you? There is power in a king's blood."

14048,YGRITTE: Mance is different.
14049,JON: You don't have the discipline. You don't have the training. Your army is no army. You don't know how to fight together.

14066,MEERA: Leave him alone.
14067,OSHA: He can speak for himself.
14068,JOJEN: I don't fill his head with anything.

14079,NARRATOR:OSHA kneels next to BRAN.
14080,BRAN: The raven's been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower. He wants me to find him. I don't have my legs anymore. This is what I have now.
14081,OSHA: You have a family. You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong.
14082,BRAN: What if I belong in the North? What if I fell from that tower for a reason?
14083,"OSHA:  Is that what he's telling you? That it's all for a reason? All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you? I wish it were true, little lord. But the gods wouldn't spare a raven's cold shit for you or me or anyone."
14084,BRAN: You don't understand. You don't know.
14085,"NARRATOR:OSHA stands, agitated."
14086,"OSHA: You don't know. None of you know. None of you have been up there. I had a man once. A good man. Bruni, his name was. I was his and he was mine. But one night Bruni disappears. People said he left me, but I knew him. He'd never leave me. Not for long."
14087,NARRATOR:OSHA sits.
14088,"OSHA: I knew he'd come back. And he did. He came in through the back of the hut. Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really. His skin was pale like a dead man's. His eyes bluer than clear sky. He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me. I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart. And he hardly seemed to notice. I had to burn our hut down with him inside. I didn't ask the gods what it meant. I didn't need to. I already knew. It meant the North was no place for men to be. Not anymore. I promised your maester I'd get you to Castle Black and no further."

14091,NARRATOR:QYBURN tends to the stump of JAIME's right arm. His wrist is sewn roughly.
14092,"QYBURN: How is the pain, my lord?"
14093,JAIME:  What's the purpose of an arm with no hand?
14094,"QYBURN:  Well, we've stymied the corruption."
14095,"JAIME: Yes, we've stymied the corruption. You're a learned man."
14096,QYBURN: All the good it's done me.
14097,NARRATOR:QYBURN places a salve onto JAIME's healing wound.
14098,JAIME: You did well sewing up this mess. You're far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle.
14099,"QYBURN: Faint praise, my lord."
14100,JAIME: So why did the Citadel take your chain? Did you fondle one boy too many?
14101,NARRATOR:QYBURN dresses JAIME's wound once more.
14102,"QYBURN:  No, my lord. That's not my weakness."
14103,JAIME: What is?
14104,QYBURN:  Curiosity. The only way to treat disease is to understand disease. And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted.
14105,JAIME: You performed experiments on living men.
14106,QYBURN: On dying men.
14107,JAIME: With their permission?
14108,QYBURN:  My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives.
14109,"JAIME: Dying paupers, I assume. Men with no families to complain. You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside."
14110,"QYBURN: How many men have you killed, my lord?"
14111,JAIME:  I don't know.
14112,QYBURN: 50? 100?
14113,JAIME: (shakes his head)
14114,QYBURN: Countless.
14115,JAIME: Countless has a nice ring to it.
14116,QYBURN: And how many lives have you saved?
14117,QYBURN:  A bird flew off and a bird flew back.  Lord Selwyn Tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughter's safe return.
14118,JAIME: A fair offer.
14119,NARRATOR:JAIME stands. QYBURN packs up his medicines.
14120,QYBURN: A fair offer. Locke won't take it.
14121,JAIME: Why not?
14122,QYBURN:  He's convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros.
14123,JAIME: (sighs)
14124,QYBURN: He feels he's being cheated.
14125,JAIME: They'd be fools to kill her.
14126,"QYBURN: These men have been at war a long time. Most of them will be dead by winter. She'll be their entertainment tonight. Beyond tonight, I don't think they care very much."
14127,"NARRATOR:JAIME ponders, and then approaches STEELSHANKS WALTON, who drinks from a wine skin nearby"
14128,JAIME: We have to return to Harrenhal.
14129,STEELSHANKS WALTON: Why?
14130,JAIME:  I've left something behind.
14131,STEELSHANKS WALTON: Absolutely not. I've got orders from Lord Bolton.
14132,JAIME: And what are those orders?
14133,STEELSHANKS WALTON:  To deliver you to your father at King's Landing.
14134,JAIME: You think you'll get a reward.
14135,NARRATOR:STEELSHANKS WALTON stands.
14136,STEELSHANKS WALTON: I serve Lord Bolton. Any appreciation your father--
14137,"JAIME: You think you're getting a reward. Let me explain something to you. When my father sees me, the first thing he's going to ask is what happened to my hand. And I'm going to tell him this man chopped it off."
14138,STEELSHANKS WALTON: I had nothing--
14139,JAIME: Or I could tell him this man saved my life. We return to Harrenhal now.
14140,CUT TO: Horses galloping back to Harrenhall.
14141,EXT: The ruins of Harrenhall.
14142,NARRATOR:JAIME and the en ride into the old courtyard. The castle is a ruin around them.
14143,JAIME: Whoa.
14144,"STEELSHANKS WALTON: Eyes open, lads."
14145,NARRATOR:JAIME searches with eyes and ears.
14146,JAIME: Be quiet.
14147,NARRATOR:JAIME hears singing in the distance. He dismounts and runs towards the sounds of the crowd. STEELSHANKS WALTON and his men follow.
14148,"MEN: (singing) The bear, the bear and the maiden fair / From there to here, from here to there All black and brown and covered in hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear, the bear, and the maiden fair!"
14149,"NARRATOR:Jaime climbs some wooden steps to join the crowd on a viewing platform. The crowd yells and cheers. In a wooden arena, Brienne stands desperate and defensive, brandishing a wooden sword. Her dress is torn and covered in  mud. Blood oozes from gashes on her neck and shoulder. An enormous brown bear lumbers and stalks her.  The bear roars."
14150,MAN: Don't spare her.  Don't spare her!
14151,"LOCKE: Well, this is one shameful fucking performance. Stop running and fight."
14152,JAIME: A wooden sword?
14153,NARRATOR:LOCKE notices that JAIME is in the crowd.
14154,LOCKE: I thought you'd gone.
14155,NARRATOR:JAIME pushes his way towards LOCKE.
14156,JAIME: You gave her a wooden sword.
14157,LOCKE: We've only got one bear.
14158,"JAIME: I'll pay her bloody ransom. Gold, sapphires, whatever you want. Just get her out of there."
14159,LOCKE: All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold.
14160,NARRATOR:LOCKE shoves JAIME.
14161,LOCKE: This makes me happier than all your gold ever could. And that makes me happier than all her sapphires. So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it.
14162,"NARRATOR:The bear rears up before BRIENNE. She tries to hold him off with her wooden sword, but the bear's reach is too long. He takes a powerful swipe and disarms her. BRIENNE staggers backwards. The bear pounces and knocks her to the ground."
14163,BRIENNE: Ah!
14164,"NARRATOR:JAIME jumps into the wooden arena, arms flailing. He lands behind her, and startles the bear."
14165,JAIME: Get behind me.
14166,BRIENNE: I will not.
14167,"NARRATOR:He helps BRIENNE up as the bear regroups. JAIME puts himself in front of BRIENNE. The bear regroups, swipes the ground and advances on them. Suddenly, a crossbow bolt pierces the bear's side. He turns his head towards the pain in its shoulder."
14168,LOCKE: What the fuck are you doing to my bear?
14169,STEELSHANKS WALTON:  Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to King's Landing alive and that's what I aim to do.
14170,"NARRATOR:The bear shakes its head back and forth, confused by the pain. JAIME runs to the arena wall and crouches by the wall."
14171,JAIME: Pull her up.
14172,NARRATOR:BRIENNE clambers onto JAIME's back. A man in the crowd grabs her outstretched hand. Two men pull her to safety. The bear roars.
14173,BRIENNE: Hold my legs.
14174,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE lies over the side of the platform and reaches down. The bear  charges at JAIME. STEELSHANKS WALTON fires a bolt that lands wide. JAIME jumps and grabs hold of a beam that juts out of the arena wall and clambers just out of reach of the bear. The bear roars. BRIENNE continues to reach down to JAIME as he tries clumsily to scale the wall. He swings his legs up, gains some leverage and hooks his handless forearm around the beam. He then lurches into BRIENNE's reach."
14175,BRIENNE: Pull him up!
14176,NARRATOR:BRIENNE and the men pull JAIME up to safety. The bear pounds the wall.
14177,LOCKE: The bitch stays.
14178,NARRATOR:JAIME stands up to confront LOCKE.
14179,JAIME: We're taking her to King's Landing. Unless you kill me.
14180,LOCKE: She belongs to me. Lord Bolton's orders.
14181,JAIME: What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton?  Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive?
14182,"NARRATOR:JAIME and LOCKE stand off. LOCKE's men prepare for a fight, but LOCKE relents."
14183,"JAIME:  Well, we must be on our way. Sorry about the sapphires."
14184,NARRATOR:JAIME and BRIENNE push their way through the crowd and walk off. STEELSHANKS WALTON follows. The bear roars.
14185,"EXT: Riverlands woods, morning"
14186,"NARRATOR:ARYA lies on the ground, eyes open. She gets up quietly, picks up a large rock and creeps towards the sleeping HOUND, step by step. The Hound sleeps peacefully. She raises it over her head to strike. Without moving, he speaks. She freezes."
14187,"HOUND: I'll give you one try, girl."
14188,NARRATOR:He turns to look at her.
14189,"HOUND: Kill me and you're free. But if I live, I'll break both your hands. Go on, hit me. Hit me hard."
14190,"CUT TO: Riverlands, edge of the woods, later."
14191,"NARRATOR:The HOUND rides his horse, with ARYA sitting side saddle in front of him. He takes a bite of an apple and then offers to share with ARYA. She looks, but ignores it, so the HOUND takes another bite."
14192,"HOUND: Sulk all you want. The truth is, you're lucky. You don't want to be alone out here, girl. Someone worse than me would find you."
14193,ARYA: There's no one worse than you.
14194,"HOUND: Ha, you never knew my brother. He once killed a man for snoring. There's plenty worse than me. There's men who like to beat little girls, men who like to rape them. I saved your sister from some of them."
14195,ARYA: You're lying.
14196,"HOUND: Ask her, if you ever see her again. Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back. They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open."
14197,NARRATOR:They reach a vista with an expansive river.
14198,ARYA: Is that the Blackwater?
14199,HOUND:  The Blackwater?  Where do you think I'm taking you?
14200,ARYA:  Back to King's Landing to Joffrey and the queen.
14201,HOUND: Fuck Joffrey. Fuck the queen. That's the Red Fork. I'm taking you to the Twins.
14202,ARYA: But why?
14203,HOUND:  Because your mother and brother will be there and they'll pay me for you.
14204,ARYA: Why would they be at the Twins?
14205,HOUND:  Those outlaws you love so much never told you?  The whole countryside is yapping about it. Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls. So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding.
14206,"NARRATOR:The HOUND goads his mount, and they continue to ride."
14207,EXT: Essos.
14208,"NARRATOR:Soldiers gallop through the barren landscape outside Yunkai. DAENERYS, JORAH and BARRSITAN watch them from a distance, hidden in a crag. They are wrapped in drab fabrics to manage the heat of the desert."
14209,BARRISTAN: Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty. They cannot be trusted.
14210,JORAH: They can be trusted to kill you if they're well paid. The Yunkish are paying them well.
14211,DAENERYS: You know these men?
14212,"JORAH:  Only by the broken swords on their banners. They're called the Second Sons. A company led by a Braavosi named Mero, ""The Titan's Bastard."""
14213,DAENERYS: Is he more titan or bastard?
14214,"JORAH:  He's a dangerous man, khaleesi. They all are."
14215,DAENERYS: How many?
14216,"BARRISTAN:  2,000, Your Grace. Armored and mounted."
14217,DAENERYS: Enough to make a difference?
14218,BARRISTAN: (nods)
14219,DAENERYS:  It's hard to collect wages from a corpse. I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.
14220,JORAH: I imagine you're right.
14221,DAENERYS: I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.
14222,JORAH: He may not agree to meet.
14223,DAENERYS: He will. A man who fights for gold can't afford to lose to a girl.
14224,"CUT: Dany, Barristan, Mero, Prendahl, Daario, Jorah,Missandei"
14225,EXT: An open tent outside of Yunkai
14226,"NARRATOR:BARRISTAN stands next to MERO, PRENDAHL and DAARO. DAENERYS sits in front of them with MISSANDEI and GREY WORM stand nearby."
14227,DAARIO:  Daario Naharis
14228,NARRATOR:MERO steps forward.
14229,MERO: You are the Mother of Dragons?  I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys.
14230,JORAH: Mind your tongue.
14231,NARRATOR:MERO sits on the couch next to DAENERYS. DAARIO and PRENDAHL sit nearby.
14232,MERO: Why?  I didn't mind hers. She licked my ass like she was born to do it.
14233,NARRATOR:MERO waggles his tongue suggestively at DAENERYS. She does not react.
14234,"MERO: (laughs) You, slave girl, bring wine."
14235,DAENERYS: We have no slaves here.
14236,MERO: You'll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you. Take your clothes off and come and sit on Mero's lap and I may give you my Second Sons.
14237,"DAENERYS: Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded. Ser Barristan, how many men fight for the Second Sons?"
14238,"BARRISTAN: Under 2,000, Your Grace."
14239,"DAENERYS: We have more, don't we?"
14240,"BARRISTAN:  10,000 Unsullied."
14241,"NARRATOR:MISSANDEI serves wine to MERO, He toasts DAENERYS and drinks. MISSANDEI serves DAARIO and PRENDAHL."
14242,"DAENERYS: I'm only a young girl, new to the ways of war, but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us."
14243,"DAARIO: I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie. You have 8,000 Unsullied."
14244,DAENERYS: You're very young to be a captain.
14245,PRENDAHL: He's not a captain. He's a lieutenant.
14246,"DAENERYS: Even if your numbers are right, you must admit the odds don't favor your side."
14247,MERO: The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won.
14248,JORAH: The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run.
14249,DAENERYS: Or you could fight for me.
14250,NARRATOR:MERO motions for more wine. MISSANDEI obliges.
14251,MERO: We've taken the slavers' gold. We fight for Yunkai.
14252,DAENERYS: I would pay you as much and more.
14253,"NARRATOR:MERO sniffs MISSNDEI, who jumps back, startled."
14254,"PRENDAHL: Our contract is our bond. If we break our bond, no one will hire the Second Sons again."
14255,DAENERYS: Ride with me and you'll never need another contract. You'll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms.
14256,DAARIO: You have no ships. You have no siege weapons. You have no cavalry.
14257,"DAENERYS: A fortnight ago, I had no army. A year ago, I had no dragons. You have two days to decide."
14258,"MERO: Show me your cunt. I want to see if it's worth fighting for.  Grey WORM: (speaks Valyrian) My Queen, shall I slice out his tongue for you?"
14259,DAENERYS: (speaks Valyrian) These men are our guests. (Speaks common.) You seem to be enjoying my wine. Perhaps you'd like a flagon to help you ponder.
14260,MERO: Only a flagon? And what are my brothers in arms to drink?
14261,"DAENERYS:  A barrel, then."
14262,NARRATOR:MERO stands. DAARIO and PRENDAHL follow suit. They start to leave.
14263,"MERO: Good. The Titan's Bastard does not drink alone. In the Second Sons, we share everything. After the battle, maybe we'll all share you."
14264,NARRATOR:DAARIO and DAENERYS exchange a glance. MERO gives a lecherous look to MISSANDEI as he passes.
14265,MERO: I'll come looking for you when this is over.
14266,NARRATOR:Mero slaps Missandei's rump as he leaves.
14267,"DAENERYS: Ser Barristan, if it comes to battle, kill that one first."
14268,"BARRISTAN: Gladly, Your Grace."

14271,INT: Dragonstone War Room.
14272,"NARRATOR:STANIS stands among his maps. MELISANDRE, GENDRY and their accompanying soldiers enter. STANNIS walks over to GENDRY and grabs him by the chin to get. a better look at his face. GENDRY stares back."
14273,"STANNIS: Half Robert, half lowborn."
14274,MELISANDRE: Show the boy to his chambers. Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes. I'll come visit you soon.
14275,NARRATOR:GENDRY exits with the soldiers.
14276,STANNIS: What do you mean to do with him?
14277,MELISANDRE:  You know what I mean to do with him.
14278,"STANNIS: Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?  If it needs to be done, do it. Don't torture the boy."
14279,"MELISANDRE: Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?"
14280,STANNIS:  No.
14281,"MELISANDRE: If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor."
14282,STANNIS: You've slaughtered many lambs?
14283,MELISANDRE:  And none have seen the blade.
14284,NARRATOR:MELISSANDRE exits.
14285,CUT TO: Dragonstone dungeon.
14286,"NARRATOR:DAVOS sits, trying to sound out words by candlelight."
14287,"NARRATOR:DAVOS smiles, pleased with himself. STANNIS enters and DAVOS rises to meet him. They talk across the bars that imprison DAVOS."
14288,DAVOS: ' Your Grace.
14289,STANNIS: They feeding you enough?
14290,"DAVOS:  Two meals a day. Cold for breakfast, hot for supper. I cannot complain."
14291,STANNIS: You don't belong in a place like this.
14292,"DAVOS: Well, it's sad to say, but I've seen worse."
14293,STANNIS: Yeah.
14294,DAVOS: I'm sorry about your son. Didn't get the chance to tell you before. Good lad. Loyal lad.
14295,DAVOS: (nods)
14296,STANNIS: Melisandre's returned.
14297,DAVOS: I didn't know she'd been gone.
14298,STANNIS: Came back with a bastard boy. Robert's bastard boy.
14299,DAVOS: Why?
14300,STANNIS:  She says there's power in king's blood.
14301,DAVOS: She's going to kill him.
14302,STANNIS: Sacrifice him.
14303,"DAVOS: Forgive me, Your Grace, I'm not a learned man, but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice?  The boy is your nephew."
14304,STANNIS: What of it? We're at war. Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night?
14305,DAVOS:  Because he has your blood in his veins.
14306,STANNIS: So did Renly.
14307,"DAVOS: Renly wronged you. Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you. He raised an army, stole your bannermen. This boy has done you no harm. He's an innocent."
14308,"STANNIS: How many boys live in Westeros? How many girls? How many men? How many women?The darkness will devour them all, she says. The night that never ends. Unless I triumph. I never asked for this. No more than I asked to be king. We do not choose our destiny, but we must do our duty, no?  Great or small, we must do our duty. What's one bastard boy against a kingdom?"
14309,"DAVOS:  Your Grace, why did you come to see me today?"
14310,STANNIS:  I came to free you. If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again.
14311,DAVOS: I swear it. I can't swear never to speak against her.
14312,STANNIS: You have little regard for your own life.
14313,"DAVOS: Quite little, Your Grace. Verging on none. You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow, but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew I'd counsel restraint. You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself. You're not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory. When my son was five he said to me, 'I don't ever want to die. ' I wanted to say to him, 'You won't, child. You won't ever.' I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark, afraid. I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night."
14314,"STANNIS: I saw a vision in the flames. A great battle in the snow. I saw it. And you saw whatever she gave birth to. I never believed, but when you see the truth, when it's right there in front of you as real as these iron bars, how can you deny her god is real?"
14315,EXT: Outside Yunkai
14316,"NARRATOR:The camp of the Second Sons bustles with the work of the day. MERO, DAARIO and PRENDAHL sit in an open tent. MERO fondles the bare-chested WHORE who sits on his lap."
14317,PRENDAHL:  Little dragon bitch. She talks too much.
14318,DAARIO: You talk too much.
14319,MERO: She won't talk so much when she's choking on my cock.
14320,DAARIO: 8000 unsullied stand between her and your cock.
14321,MERO: My cock will find a way. Tell him. Is there any place that my cock can't reach?
14322,DAARIO: She'll tell me whatever you pay her to tell me.
14323,"MERO: Daario Naharis, the whore who doesn't like whores."
14324,"DAARIO: I like them very much. I just refuse to pay them. And I'm no whore, my friend."
14325,MERO: She sells her sheath and you sell your blade. What's the difference?
14326,DAARIO:  I fight for beauty.
14327,PRENDAHL: For beauty?
14328,MERO:  We fight for gold.
14329,MERO: You'll die young.
14330,"PRENDAHL: What do we do about the dragon girl?  We can't beat 8,000 Unsullied on the battlefield."
14331,MERO: There won't be a battle. And we don't have to deal with her eunuchs. We only have to deal with her.
14332,PRENDAHL: She's well guarded.
14333,MERO: Tonight's a new moon. One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights.
14334,PRENDAHL: Which one of us?
14335,"MERO:  Close your eyes, love."
14336,"NARRATOR:The WHORE stands, and MERO picks up a coin purse. He pours out three coins into his hand."
14337,"MERO: Three coins. A coin from Meereen, a coin from Volantis, and a coin from Braavos. The Braavosi does the deed. One for each of us, darling. No peeking."
14338,"NARRATOR:MERO hands the coins to the WHORE, spins her around and plants a kiss  and a slap on her ass.  She blindly feels her way forward to PRENDAHL, who takes a coin. She then fumbles back to MERO, and he takes a coin. She then orients he way to DAARIO."
14339,DAARIO: Do you hear me?  Follow my voice. I'm right here.
14340,"NARRATOR:She falls into his lap, laughing."
14341,DAARIO: You have something for me?
14342,"NARRATOR:DAARIO takes the final coin from the WHORE's hand, and holds it up. It is the Braavosi coin."

14349,NARRATOR:SHAE and PODRICK exit. TYRION shuts the door.
14350,"TYRION:  My lady, I want you to know I didn't ask for this."
14351,"SANSA: I hope I will not disappoint you, my lord."
14352,"SANSA: I doubt that very much, my lord."
14353,TYRION: You're right. I have no idea how you feel. And you have no idea how I feel.
14354,"NARRATOR:TYRION takes SANSA's hand, tenderly."
14355,"TYRION: But I promise you one thing, my lady. I won't ever hurt you. Do you drink wine?"

14363,MARGAERY:  It's the word that came to mind.
14364,NARRATOR:MARGAERY takes CERSEI's arm in hers.
14365,MARGAERY: We're going to be sisters soon. We should be friends.
14366,"CERSEI: You're a musical girl, aren't you?  I imagine you have a lovely voice."
14367,NARRATOR:The begin to descend into the sept.
14368,"MARGAERY: A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid."
14369,"CERSEI: Ah, but you know the song 'The Rains of Castamere'?"
14370,"NARRATOR:They pass LORAS, and stop a bit further along."
14371,MARGAERY:  Of course. They play it so often here at court.
14372,CERSEI: So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere?
14373,"MARGAERY:  Not as well as you, I'm sure."
14374,CERSEI: House Reyne was a powerful family. Very wealthy. The second wealthiest in Westeros. Aren't the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now?
14375,MARGAERY: (nods)
14376,"CERSEI:  Of course, ambitious climbers don't want to stop on the second highest rung. If only you could take that final step, you'd see further than all the rest. You'd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you. So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock. He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore. And finally one day, he rebelled against my father. Do you know where House Reyne is now?"
14377,MARGAERY:  Gone.
14378,"CERSEI: Gone. A gentle word. Why not say slaughtered? Every man, woman, and child put to the sword."
14379,NARRATOR:They continue down the great stairs to the main floor.
14380,"CERSEI: I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock. My father let them rot up there all summer. It was a long summer. 'And now the rains weep o'er their halls, and not a soul to hear.'"
14381,NARRATOR:They pause. CERSEI looks MARGAERY in the eye and frees her arm.
14382,"CERSEI: If you ever call me sister again, I'll have you strangled in your sleep."
14383,NARRATOR:CERSEI exits.
14384,CUT TO: Outside the sept.
14385,"NARRATOR:The great doors open to Baelor's Sept. SANSA walks through them, alone."
14386,CUT TO: Inside the sept.
14387,"NARRATOR:TYRION stands on the stage, watching SANSA enter at the other side of the sept. The crowd quiets. SANSA pauses at the top of the steps. JOFFREY approaches, smirking."
14388,SANSA: What are you doing?
14389,"JOFFREY:  Your father's gone. As the father of the realm, it is my duty to give you away to your husband."
14390,"NARRATOR:Sansa takes Joffrey's arm. The doors closes. They descend the stairs and walk throufgh the crowd, Sansa and Joffrey apprach Tyrion, passsing Bronn, Margaery, Olenna, Loras, Cersei, Tywin, Pycelle, and reach TYRION and the HIGH SEPTON. JOFFREY reaches down and takes TYRION's step stool, and noisily joins CERSEI and TYWIN. TYRION fumes."
14391,HIGH SEPTON: You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection.
14392,"NARRATOR:SANSA turns her back to TYRION. He attempts to cloak Sansa, but he is too short. Joffrey snickers and some in the crowd join in. TYWIN quiets their rudeness with a look."
14393,TYRION: Could you-
14394,"NARRATOR:SANSA kneels for TYRION. He places the cloak on her shoulders, and she accepts it. She rises"
14395,TYRION: Thank you.
14396,"HIGH SEPTON: Your Grace, Your Grace, my lords, my ladies, we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife. One flesh, one heart, one soul, now and forever."
14397,INT: DRAGONSTONE
14398,"NARRATOR:GENDRY paces nervously in his chambers. The door opens noisily, and MELISANDRE enters, holding an ornate box."
14399,MELISANDRE: Have you ever seen one like it?
14400,GENDRY:  I've never seen anything like any of this. Not in my life.
14401,"MELISANDRE: It's shocking, isn't it, the first time you encounter real wealth?  When I was your age, I lived on one bowl of stew a day. And stew is a kind word for it."
14402,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE lights a stick and uses it to ignite some more candles.
14403,GENDRY: In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown. We'd pretend that the meat in them was chicken. We knew it wasn't chicken.
14404,NARRATOR:Melisandre hands a chalice of wine to Gendry.
14405,"MELISANDRE: Here, taste this."
14406,"NARRATOR:GENDRY stands motionless, refusing the wine."
14407,MELISANDRE: You think I'm trying to poison you?
14408,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE takes a deep drink. The GENDRY takes the wine from MELISANDRE, and drinks, thirstily."
14409,GENDRY:  That's good.
14410,NARRATOR:He nearly finishes it in two drinks.
14411,GENDRY: That's really good.
14412,MELISANDRE: Where do you think it's from?
14413,GENDRY:  I couldn't even guess.
14414,"MELISANDRE: Doesn't matter, does it?  It's the real thing or it's not. You only need a tongue to tell the difference. Go on, have some more. You still don't trust it. You think this is all a mistake and that you'll have to pay somehow for every bite you take."
14415,"GENDRY: That thought had crossed my mind, yeah."
14416,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE strokes GENDRY's cheek.
14417,MELISANDRE: There are no mistakes. Not for us.
14418,GENDRY: I'm a mistake. I'm only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern.
14419,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE takes a sip of wine. As she speaks, she caresses GENDRY and begins to undress him."
14420,"MELISANDRE: Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it. He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you can't even begin to understand. And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world. We're both a part of His plan. He wants this for us. No, He demands this of us."
14421,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE removes GENDRY's shirt.
14422,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE fondles GENDRY's midriff.
14423,"MELISANDRE: According to whom?  The Silent Sisters? With their stern looks, muzzled mouths, and dried-up cunts? What have their gods done for you?  Hmm?  When you pray to them, what's their answer?  A god is real or he's not. You only need eyes to see."
14424,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE drops her dress to the floor and caresses the back of GENDRY's head.
14425,"MELISANDRE: Death is coming for everyone and everything. A darkness that will swallow the dawn. And we can stop it, you and I."
14426,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE leads GENDRY to the side of the bed. She kisses him, and gently pushes him back onto the bed. She undoes his pants and strides him."
14427,MELISANDRE: Let me show you what you have inside you. Come fight death with me.
14428,"NARRATOR:She helps him inside of her, and they both undulate and moan with pleasure. GENDRY fondles her breasts, and MELISANDRE gently leads his hands to the headboard of the grand bed. She quickly binds them with a single pull on a leather strap."
14429,GENDRY: What are you doing?
14430,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE gives him a peck.
14431,MELISANDRE:  You have to trust me.
14432,"NARRATOR:She searches down GENDRY's body, and he gives himself over to her, eyes closed. She binds GENDRY's booted feet to the other end of the bed. He opens his eyes, watching and panting. MELISANDRE opens the ornate box at the side of the bed and pulls out a leech and places it on GENDRY's chest. He begins to panic."
14433,GENDRY: What--?  Get it away. Get it off me.
14434,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE places more leeches on GENDRY's chest.
14435,"MELISANDRE: Don't fight, don't fight. They won't take much."
14436,GENDRY: Why are you doing this?
14437,MELISANDRE:  I told you there's power in the blood of kings. And you have so much blood.
14438,"GENDRY: No. No, no, no, no! Not there. Not there!"
14439,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE places a leech on GENDRY's groin. The chamber door opens. STANNIS and DAVOS enter.
14440,MELISANDRE:  You can blame Ser Davos. He didn't believe in the power of king's blood. He wanted a demonstration.
14441,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE walks to her dress and slips it back on. STANNIS  approaches them.
14442,"GENDRY: Please. Please, Your Grace. My lord!"
14443,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE returns to GENDRY, and removes the leeches with her forcepts."
14444,GENDRY: (cries out)
14445,"NARRATOR:Melisandre hands leeches to Stannis, next to the brazier that she lit earlier. Stannis takes out the leaches one by one, tossing them into the flames, which spark with each one."
14446,STANNIS:  The usurper Robb Stark. The usurper Balon Greyjoy. The usurper Joffrey Baratheon.
14447,"INT: King's Landing, the wedding reception."
14448,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY and CERSEI sit amist the festivities drinking wine and chatting. TYWIN sits to their left, stoic. At the head table, TYRION carefully (and drunkenly) fills his wine glass right to the brim. He smacks his lips and looks over to SANSA, who is disgusted with him. The Tyrells sit across the hall from the Lannisters. OLENNA speaks with amusement to LORAS and MARGAERY."
14449,"OLENNA: So their son will be your nephew. After you're wed to Cersei, of course. And you will be the king's stepfather and brother-in-law. When you marry the king, Joffrey's mother will become his sister-in-law and your son will be Loras' nephew?  Grandson?  I'm not sure. But your brother will become your father-in-law. That much is beyond dispute."
14450,"NARRATOR:LORAS leaves in a huff. At the head table, TYRION checks his teeth in a golden plate and tosses it aside. TYWIN looks on with disdain as TYRION spills his wine. He starts to clean himself with the table cloth. The embarrasment brings SANSA out of her stiff discomfort."
14451,TYRION: (snorts)
14452,"SANSA: Will you pardon me, my lord?"
14453,TYRION:  Of course. Of course. En--enjoy.
14454,"NARRATOR:SANSA stands and exits. JOFFREY gets up to intercept her, but CERSEI steadies him with a touch to the hand."
14455,CERSEI: Perhaps you could talk to your bride-to-be instead.
14456,JOFFREY: I've got a lifetime for that.
14457,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY shakes off her hand and leaves, CERSEI sighs and gets up to follow. Her handmaiden starts to trail her."
14458,CERSEI: Stay.
14459,"NARRATOR:Back at the head table, TYRION notices SANSA talking to VARYS, with SHAE standing by them. TYWIN appears beside him, startling TYRION."
14460,TYWIN: You seem rather drunk.
14461,TYRION: Rather less than I plan to be. Isn't it a man's duty to be drunk at his own wedding?
14462,"TYWIN:  This isn't about your wedding. Renly Baratheon had a wedding. Your wife needs a child, a Lannister child, as soon as possible."
14463,TYRION: And?
14464,"TYWIN:  If you're going to give her one, you need to perform."
14465,TYRION: What did you once call me?  A drunken little lust-filled beast.
14466,TYWIN: More than once.
14467,"TYRION: There you have it. Nothing to worry about. Drinking and lust, no man can match me in these things. I am the god of tits and wine. I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit."
14468,NARRATOR:TYWIN takes away TYRION's wine and slams it on the table. TYRION spits and fumes.
14469,"TYWIN: You can drink, you can joke, you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable, but you will do your duty."
14470,"NARRATOR:TYWIN returns to his own seat. LORAS stands above in the balustrade, surveying the scene from afar. TYRION salutes LORAS with his cup. LORAS looks away uncomfortably, and notices CERSEI on the balustrade, looking out at the sea. He approaches her."
14471,"LORAS: Well, my father once told me--"
14472,CERSEI: Nobody cares what your father once told you.
14473,NARRATOR:CERSEI exits.
14474,CUT TO: The Wedding Celebration
14475,"NARRATOR:SANSA walks through the revelry with SHAE. After opening a curtain for SANSA, SHAE quickly departs as JOFFREY intercepts SANSA."
14476,"JOFFREY: Congratulations, my lady."
14477,"SANSA: Thank you, Your Grace."
14478,"JOFFREY: Well, you've done it. You've married a Lannister. Soon you'll have a Lannister baby. It's a dream come true for you, isn't it?  What a glorious day."
14479,"SANSA: Yes, Your Grace."
14480,JOFFREY: I suppose it doesn't really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you. Maybe I'll pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out. How'd you like that?
14481,NARRATOR:SANSA does not reply.
14482,JOFFREY: You wouldn't? That's all right. Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down.
14483,NARRATOR:JOFFREY smirks cruelly as he turns back to the main hall and claps his hands for attention.
14484,JOFFREY: Time for the bedding ceremony.
14485,TYRION: There will be no bedding ceremony.
14486,NARRATOR:JOFFREY takes SANSA's hand and leads her to the central banquet floor.
14487,"JOFFREY: Where's your respect for tradition, Uncle? Come, everyone. Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed. Get rid of her gown. She won't be needing it any longer. Ladies, attend to my uncle. He's not heavy."
14488,TYRION: There will be no bedding ceremony.
14489,JOFFREY: There will be if I command it.
14490,NARRATOR:TYRION stabs his knife resoundingly into the table in front of him. JOFFREY is shocked.
14491,TYRION: Then you'll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock.
14492,NARRATOR:Tywin rises from his seat.
14493,JOFFREY: What did you say? What did you say?
14494,"TYWIN:  I believe we can dispense with the bedding, Your Grace. I'm sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king."
14495,"NARRATOR:TYRION's hand shakes with rage as he grips the knife with all his strength. Suddenly, he regains his drunken composure. He releases the knife and laughs obsequiously."
14496,"TYRION: A bad joke, Your Grace. Made out of envy of your own royal manhood. Mine is so small. My poor wife won't even know I'm there."
14497,"TYWIN: Your uncle is clearly quite drunk, Your Grace."
14498,"NARRATOR:TYRION staggers from the head table, and tumbles into another as he walks."
14499,"TYRION: My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do. Come, wife."
14500,"NARRATOR:TYRION entreats SANSA to come with him. She follows, embarrassed and small."
14501,"TYRION: I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act. Not proud of it. But I think honesty is important between a man and wife, don't you agree?  Come, I'll tell you all about it. Put you in the mood."
14502,CUT TO: Tyrion's Chambers
14503,"NARRATOR:TYRION opens the door for SANSA. She enters nervously. TYRION closes the door, and staggers directly to the wine, and pours himself a glass."
14504,"SANSA: Is that wise, my lord?"
14505,"TYRION:  Tyrion, Sansa. My name is Tyrion."
14506,"SANSA: Is that wise, Tyrion?"
14507,TYRION:  Nothing was ever wiser.
14508,NARRATOR:TYRION sits on the side of the bed.
14509,TYRION: Astoundingly long.
14510,SANSA: What?
14511,TYRION:  Neck. You have one. How old are you exactly?
14512,SANSA: 14
14513,"TYRION:  Well, talk won't make you any older. My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage."
14514,NARRATOR:SANSA takes a breath. She pours herself some wine and drinks it. TYRION offers a drunken toast of solidarity. SANSA moves quietly and obediently to the bed and undresses her many layers while TYRION watches.
14515,"TYRION: Stop. I can't. I could, I won't."
14516,SANSA: But your father--
14517,"TYRION: If my father wants someone to get fucked, I know where he can start. I won't share your bed. Not until you want me to."
14518,SANSA: What if I never want you to?
14519,NARRATOR:TYRION toasts SANSA.
14520,TYRION:  And so my watch begins.
14521,"NARRATOR:TYRION drinks. He turns, sets down his glass, and passes out directly.  SANSA is speechless."
14522,"EXT: Encampment outside of Yunkai, night."
14523,"NARRATOR:The encampment bustles in spite of the late hour, with the Unsullied patrolling the paths between the tents. One Unsullied trots through camp alone."
14524,INT: Daenerys's tent
14525,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI bathes DAENERYS in a tub by candlelight
14526,DAENERYS: 19
14527,"MISSANDEI: Yes, Your Grace."
14528,DAENERYS: How can anyone speak 19 languages?
14529,MISSANDEI:  It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well.
14530,MISSANDEI:  Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master. So guttural and harsh.
14531,DAENERYS: (in Dothraki) Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it. It gave him great pride.
14532,MISSANDEI: Athjahakar.
14533,DAENERYS: Athjahaka.
14534,MISSANDEI: Ath-ja-hakar.
14535,DAENERYS: Athjahakar.
14536,MISSANDEI: (nods)
14537,"DAENERYS: Well, I suppose I'm a bit out of practice."
14538,"MISSANDEI: Your High Valyrian is very good, Your Grace. The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue. It is the only proper language for poetry."
14539,MISSANDEI: (gasps)
14540,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to see MISSANDEI held captive, her mouth covered and a knife at her throat. Her assailant, DAARIO, wears the uniform of the Unsullied."
14541,DAARIO: No screaming or she dies.
14542,"NARRATOR:DAARIO leads MISSANDEI further into the tent. DAENERYS watches nervously, feeling vulnerable in her bath. DAARIO removes the knife from her throat, and lifts of the Unsullied helmet. His eyes smile at DAENERYS. She is confused and angry."
14543,DAENERYS: What do you want?
14544,NARRATOR:DAARIO places the tip of his blade back onto MISSANDEI's throat.
14545,DAARIO:  You.
14546,DAENERYS: Let her go.
14547,"DAARIO: Don't scream, lovely girl."
14548,NARRATOR:DAARIO releases MISSANDEI with a grand gesture. She scampers next to DAENERYS.
14549,DAENERYS: You were sent here to kill me?
14550,DAARIO: (nods and chuckles)
14551,DAENERYS:  So why haven't you?
14552,DAARIO:  I don't want to.
14553,DAENERYS: What do your captains have to say about that?
14554,DAARIO:  You should ask them.
14555,NARRATOR:DAARIO removes his satchel and dumps its contents on the floor. The heads of MERO and PRENDAHL thud as they hit the floor.
14556,DAENERYS: Why?
14557,DAARIO:  We had philosophical differences.
14558,DAENERYS: Over what?
14559,DAARIO:  Your beauty. It meant more to me than it did to them.
14560,DAENERYS: You're a strange man.
14561,DAARIO: I'm the simplest man you'll ever meet. I only do what I want to do.
14562,DAENERYS: And this is supposed to impress me?
14563,DAARIO:  Yes.
14564,DAENERYS: Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades?
14565,DAARIO:  They ordered me to murder you. I told them I preferred not to. They told me I had no choice. I told them I am Daario Naharis. I always have a choice. They drew their swords and I drew mine.
14566,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS rises from her bath and steps to the floor. She stands naked before DAARIO, matching his confidence with her resolve. MISSANDEI steps behind her and slips her into a robe."
14567,DAENERYS: Will you fight for me?
14568,DAARIO: (nods)
14569,NARRATOR:DAENERYS walks to him.
14570,DAENERYS:  Swear to me.
14571,"NARRATOR:DAARIO unsheathes his sword and kneels, placing it across his knees."

14574,"INT: King's Landing, Tyrion's Chambers, morning."
14575,NARRATOR:The door to TYRION's chamber opens. SANSA sleeps alone in TYRION's bed. TYRION lies on the settee that he passed out on the night before.  SHAE walks in without looking at TYRION and slam the breakfast tray the she holds onto the table. SANSA rises from the bed while TYRION struggles to even prop himself up.
14576,TYRION: You really ought to knock.
14577,SHAE: I brought your breakfast.
14578,"NARRATOR:Irritated, SHAE moves quickly through the room. She snatches SANSA's dress from under TYRION's head. His head thumps into the chair's arm. SHAE helps SANSA to dress while TYRION struggles with his hang over. SHAE begins to strip the bed, and notices that the sheets are stain-free.

14582,SAM: It's getting dark. We could stay here for the night.
14583,BABY: (fusses)
14584,"NARRATOR:GILLY hands the BABY to SAM. SAM smiles at the child while  GILLY collects firewood. A second crow joins the first in the tree. SAM pauses, surprised at the coincidence."
14585,"CUT TO: The broken barn, a bit later."
14586,"NARRATOR:The wind howls and whistles in the night. Inside the broken barn, SAM tries to strike a fire with his flint stones."
14587,SAM: How hard can it be to build a fire?
14588,GILLY:  It doesn't matter. Come under the furs. We can keep each other warm.
14589,"NARRATOR:SAM blinks rapidly, then sits next to GILLY. She spreads the furs over them both and looks at him."
14590,BABY: (fusses)
14591,SAM: He winked at me before.
14592,GILLY: I doubt it.
14593,SAM: I saw him wink at me.
14594,GILLY: He blinked.
14595,SAM: I suppose it's a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink.
14596,GILLY: A what?
14597,"SAM:  Well, I mean, there's no real difference."
14598,GILLY: A wink is on purpose.
14599,SAM: You thought of a name yet? It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name.
14600,GILLY: Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me?
14601,SAM:  What? No. This is just the way I talk.
14602,GILLY: I'll build that fire.
14603,NARRATOR:GILLY sets down the BABY and stacks the wood. She tries to strike the flint.
14604,SAM: Don't you think he should have a name?
14605,GILLY:  I don't know many boys' names.
14606,"SAM: Let's see, there's Duncan, Kevan, Jon Guymon, Feldan, Tristifer."
14607,GILLY: Craster.
14608,"NARRATOR:SAM is taken aback. While he thinks of how to respond, the fire comes alive."
14609,"SAM: Uh, yes. Maybe that's not--"
14610,GILLY: Mormont.
14611,NARRATOR:GILLY feeds the fire.
14612,"SAM: That's a lovely idea, but Mormont's a last name."
14613,GILLY: Why is it a last name?
14614,"SAM:  Well, it's a family name. For instance, I'm Samwell Tarly. Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name. You see? So my father is also a Tarly."
14615,"GILLY: His name is Samwell Tarly, too?"
14616,"SAM:  No, Randyll Tarly."
14617,GILLY: Randyll is a handsome name.
14618,SAM: Please don't name him Randyll.
14619,GILLY: Is your father cruel like mine?
14620,SAM:  Different manner of cruel.
14621,NARRATOR:GILLY blows on the fire. Crows caw outside the broken barn.
14622,"GILLY: Not Randyll, then."
14623,"NARRATOR:GILLY sits back down next to SAM. The sounds of crows escalate into a chorus of relentless cawing. SAM and GILLY listen with fear. SAM nods at her with a slight smile, and rises."

But the WALKER seizes up, howls, and falls to his knees,  his flesh hardening and cracking like ice. Suddenly, he shatters into tiny shards, practically vanishing into crystal dust. SAM and GILLY are stupefied. The crows begin to sound again. SAM grabs GILLY. They run away from the barn and into the woods. The crows take to flight, swarming them and cawing in a thunderous clamor."

14684,NARRATOR:ROBB looks at the Frey women
14685,"ROBB: My ladies.  All men should keep their word, kings most of all.  I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow.  The fault is not with you.  Any man would be lucky to have any one of you.  I did what I did not to slight you, but because I loved another.  I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house.  I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends."

14693,"WALDER: Love.  That's what the Starks of Winterfell call it, eh?  Heh. Very honorable, I call it a pretty face.  Mmmm, very pretty.  Prettier than this lot, that's for sure.  Very shapely as well.  Oh, you try to hide her under that dress.  If you wanted to hide her, you shouldn't have brought her here in the first place."
14694,NARRATOR:WALDER leans forward with a grin
14695,"WALDER: I can always see what's going on beneath a dress.  Been at this a long time.  I bet when you take that dress off, everything stays right where it is.  Doesn't drop an inch."
14696,"NARRATOR:WALDER grins, ROBB visibly uncomfortable"

14698,NARRATOR:ROBB starts to step forward before CATELYN stops him
14699,"WALDER: And I can respect that.  When I was your age, I'd have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought.  Well, I've enough room in the hall for you lot.  We'll set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men."
14700,NARRATOR:ROBB visibly angry
14701,"ROBB: Thank you, my lord."

14709,"NARRATOR:DAARIO gets closer to DAENERYS, grabs and guides her hand to the location he was referring to.  JORAH watches him closely"
14710,"DAARIO: There, it's a back gate.  My men use it when they visit Yunkai's bed slaves."
14711,JORAH: Your men but not you?
14712,DAARIO: I have no interest in slaves.  A man cannot make love to property.
14713,NARRATOR:DAENERYS briefly looks up at DAARIO and JORAH briefly looks at her
14714,"DAARIO: This is where we enter the city.  Very few guards, they know me.  They let me inside."

14718,"DAARIO: Then comes the army.  Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours."
14719,"JORAH: Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.  The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways cause you've already slaughtered your partners."
14720,"DAARIO: You have a very suspicious mind.  In my experience, only dishonest people think this way."
14721,NARRATOR:JORAH sighs and looks at Grey Worm
14722,JORAH: You command the Unsullied.  What do you think?

14732,"SAMWELL: We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.  It was the first castle on the Wall. The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.  Too big, impossible to maintain.  Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.  It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.  No one's used it for centuries, most likely.  It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort, if no one knows how to find it, which, it just so happens I do."
14733,NARRATOR:GILLY stops and looks at SAMWELL in a confused manner
14734,GILLY: How do you know all that?

14774,JOJEN: Doesn’t seem to be supporting anyone at the moment.
14775,MEERA: It’s good land and there’s no war up here.  Why leave?

14803,NARRATOR:JON looks at TORMUND
14804,JON: The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief.  They’ll send a lot more to hunt down murderers.

15132,"NARRATOR:The camera pans up to the hold of a sword hewn from Valeryan steel. Tywin draws it and hands it to a blacksmith, who knocks its hilt off with a hammer, and then places the blade into the forge. It melts into molten sludge and is then recast into two swords. Tywin throws the carcass of a wolf into the fire."
15133,"NARRATOR:INT. Jaime holds up a sword, admiring it."
15134,JAIME: Magnificent.
15135,TYWIN:  Mm-hmm.
15136,JAIME: Looks fresh-forged.
15137,TYWIN: It is.
15138,JAIME: No one's made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria.
15139,TYWIN: There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel. The finest of them was in Volantis. Came here to King's Landing at my invitation.
15140,JAIME: Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?
15141,TYWIN: From someone who no longer had need of it.
15142,NARRATOR:JAIME nods and hefts the blade.
15143,JAIME: You've wanted one of these in the family for a long time.
15144,TYWIN: And now we have two.
15145,JAIME: Two?
15146,TYWIN: The original weapon was absurdly large. Plenty of steel for two swords.
15147,"JAIME: Well, thank you. It's glorious."
15148,"NARRATOR:JAIME attempts to sheath the sword into the cover lying on the table, but fails awkwardly. TYWIN starts as the sheath bobbles."
15149,TYWIN: You'll have to train your left hand.
15150,JAIME: Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands.
15151,TYWIN: You'll never be as good.
15152,"JAIME: No. But as long as I'm better than everyone else, I suppose it doesn't matter."
15153,TYWIN: You can't serve in the Kingsguard with one hand.
15154,JAIME: Where's that written? I can and I will. The Kingsguard oath is for life.
15155,TYWIN:  The war is over. The king is safe. The king is never safe.
15156,JAIME: How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike?
15157,TYWIN:  Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner. They will continue to do so when you go home.
15158,JAIME: Home?
15159,TYWIN: You'll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead.
15160,JAIME:You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.
15161,TYWIN:  I am the King's Hand. My place is here. I don't expect to see the Rock again before I die.
15162,JAIME: You know what they call me? Kingslayer. Oathbreaker. Man without honor. Now you want me to break another sacred vow.
15163,TYWIN:  You won't be breaking anything. There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties. The king will exercise that prerogative.
15164,JAIME: No.
15165,TYWIN:  No?
15166,JAIME: No.
15167,TYWIN: I don't believe I asked you a question.
15168,JAIME: There's my answer.
15169,TYWIN:  If you think your bloody honor comes before...
15170,"JAIME: My bloody honor is beyond repair, but my answer is still no. I don't want Casterly Rock. I don't want a wife. I don't want children."
15171,TYWIN:  What do you want?
15172,JAIME: Supper would be nice.
15173,"TYWIN: For 40 years I've tried to teach you. If you haven't learned by now, you never will. Go. If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve."
15174,JAIME: I suppose you want the sword back.
15175,TYWIN:  Keep it.
15176,NARRATOR:JAIME grabs the sword.

15182,TYRION: Please don't.
15183,"BRONN: Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern. That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside."
15184,"TYRION: This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends."
15185,"BRONN: If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?"
15186,TYRION: There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Has been for years.
15187,"BRONN: And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood, it may as well be yours, eh?"

15197,BRONN: I need a sigil.

15202,DORNISH LORD: The prince's health forces him to remain at Sunspear. He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead.
15203,"TYRION: (Nods.) Yes, the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast."
15204,DORNISH LORD: Will he?

15212,TYRION:  We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies.
15213,BRONN: How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big?
15214,"TYRION: You're famous for fucking half of Westeros. You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads, where would you go?"

Swaddled them, rocked them, fed them at her own breast. Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them. And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman. That started a war and the war ended right here when your father's army took the city..."

15544,ALLISER THORNE:  No? You put your sword through a brother of the Night's Watch. What do you call that?
15545,JON: He wanted me to kill him.
15546,JANOS SLYNT: A bastard son of a traitor. What would you expect?
15547,JON: The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.
15548,ALLISER THORNE: Don't talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him. He was my brother.
15549,"JON: Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall. The free folk would have boiled him alive, but letting me kill him..."
15550,JANOS SLYNT: The free folk? Listen to him. He even talks like a wildling now.
15551,"JON: Aye, I talk like a wildling. I ate with the wildlings. I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I... I laid with a wildling girl."
15552,"JANOS SLYNT: You admit to breaking your vows, then?"
15553,JON: I do.
15554,JANOS SLYNT: The law is the law. The boy must die.

15558,ALLISER THORNE:  Impossible. You can't get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other.

15565,JANOS SLYNT: How dare you?!
15566,JON: There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane. I killed their warg and three others. They shot me full of arrows. Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north. The signal for the attack will be a bonfire. Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen. That's the truth. All the truth.
15567,NARRATOR:JANOS SLYNT sits back down.

15704,HOUND: A man's got to have a code.
15705,ARYA: You think I'm gonna escape? Where would I go? I'd be dead by nightfall without you. My family's gone. I've got no one.
15706,"HOUND: You've got an aunt in the Vale. Your rich Aunt Lysa. After I sell you to her, maybe she'll have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much."
15707,CUT TO: outside an Inn. Sounds of men can be heard in the buildings.
15708,ARYA: I'm hungry. You're hungry.

15713,ARYA: He killed Lommy.
15714,HOUND: What the fuck's a Lommy?
15715,ARYA: He was my friend. Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck. He's still got it.
15716,HOUND: Got what?
15717,ARYA: My sword Needle.
15718,HOUND:  Needle? Of course you named your sword.
15719,ARYA: Lots of people name their swords.
15720,HOUND: Lots of cunts.
15721,NARRATOR:The two men finish relieving themselves and return inside. The HOUND notices that ARYA has started towards the Inn.

15724,HOUND:  Get back here.
15725,ARYA:  He killed my friend.
15726,NARRATOR:The HOUND grabs ARYA roughly by the should and puts himself between her and the door.
15727,HOUND: I don't care if he ate your friend. We're not going in there.

15733,MAN: Come here.
15734,INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER: (Whimpers)
15735,MAN: Let's have a feel there.
15736,MAN #2: Leave it.
15737,NARRATOR:The INNKEEPER'S DAUGHER struggles in the grasp of one of the men ARYA enters behind the hound and shuts the door. The soldiers look warily at their the duo. Everyone goes quiet as the HOUND and ARYA enter the inn. The HOUND and ARYA sit at a table in the back. The men return to their assault on the girl.
15738,MAN: Come here.
15739,"INNKEEPER: Please, she's a good girl."
15740,POLLIVER: Shut your mouth and pour us more ale and we may not take her with us when we're done with her.

15746,POLLIVER: Pour our new friend some ale. What brings you so far north?
15747,HOUND: I could ask the same of you. What are you doing up here?
15748,POLLIVER: Just keeping the king's peace.
15749,HOUND: No need. The war's over.
15750,NARRATOR:The INNKEEPER pours them some ale. The HOUND drinks.
15751,POLLIVER: So I've heard. Stannis defeated at the Blackwater. Robb Stark killed at the Twins. And where am I for all of it? Stuck with your brother. Meaning no offense.
15752,HOUND: None taken.
15753,"POLLIVER: He's good, the Mountain is. Best at what he does. But torture, torture, torture, torture. You spend enough time putting the hammer to people, you start to feel like a carpenter making chairs. Drains the fun right out of it. And what's life without a little fun? (Chuckles)"
15754,NARRATOR:POLLIVER turns to look at ARYA.
15755,"POLLIVER: But I don't need to tell you that, eh?"
15756,HOUND: She's all right. I've had better.
15757,"POLLIVER: (Laughs) You know what? You should come with us. His kind, they've always got something hidden away somewhere. Gold, silver, more daughters. Always something if you know how to make them talk. And there's plenty of him between here and King's Landing. You could do well for yourself. We certainly have been."
15758,HOUND: I'm not going to King's Landing.
15759,POLLIVER: Think about it. We could do whatever we like wherever we go. These are the king's colors. No one's standing in his way now. Which means no one's standing in ours.
15760,HOUND: Fuck the king.
15761,NARRATOR:The chatter in the inn stops.The HOUND takes a drink.
15762,"POLLIVER: When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail and run from the Battle of the Blackwater, I didn't believe it. But here you are."
15763,HOUND: Here I am. Bring me one of those chickens.
15764,POLLIVER: You got money to pay for it?
15765,HOUND: You paid for it?
15766,"POLLIVER: (Laughs) No. But we're the king's men. So, you got money?"
15767,HOUND: Not a penny.
15768,HOUND: I'll still take that chicken.
15769,POLLIVER: Tell you what. We'll trade you. One of our little chickens for one of yours. Give us a go at your friend. Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.
15770,NARRATOR:The men chuckle.
15771,HOUND: You're a talker. Listening to talkers makes me thirsty.
15772,"NARRATOR:The HOUND takes POLLIVER's ale, and finishes it in one long drink."
15773,HOUND: Ah. And hungry. Think I'll take two chickens.
15774,POLLIVER: You don't seem to understand the situation.
15775,"HOUND: I understand that if any more words come pouring out of your cunt mouth, I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room."
15776,POLLIVER: You lived your life for the king. You're gonna die for some chickens?
15777,HOUND: Someone is.
15778,"NARRATOR:The men stare one another down. POLLIVER rises to attack, but the HOUND turns over the table, knocking him down. He then sets to the room and dispatches the soldiers one by one, while the INNKEEPER cowers. The fight is brutal, using both sword and fist. POLLIVER and a companion. are able to get the upper hand, and the HOUND falls to the ground, where they kick at him violently. ARYA watches in fright. The HOUND manages to fend them off with his sword, even from the ground. He sweeps the legs out from under one of them, and POLLIVER scambles on all fours towards his sword. The HOUND steps on the blade and slugs POLLIVER violently, who crumples to the ground. The fight continues, and the HOUND gores another soldier before TOMMY pins the HOUND to the ground, a dagger to his throat. With great strength, the HOUND pulls the man's dagger away from his throat while gouging at his face. He positions the man's face over his own dagger, and swiftly slams the soldier's face into the dagger, repeatedly."
15779,"NARRATOR:ARYA moves from shock into action. She shatters a jug over a soldier's head, then picks up a sword and stabs him through, slowly. She comes up behind POLLIVER, who is stalking the wounded HOUND, and stabs him through. She takes need from him before he falls forward to the ground. The HOUND runs another soldier through. ARYA walks calmly over POLLIVER, who lays on his back."
15780,"ARYA: Something wrong with your leg, boy?"
15781,POLLIVER: What? What do you mean?
15782,ARYA: Can you walk? I've got to carry you?
15783,POLLIVER: Carry me?
15784,ARYA: Fine little blade.
15785,NARRATOR:ARYA puts the point of her blade under POLLIVER's chin. He raises his hands weakly in surrender.
15786,ARYA: Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
15787,"NARRATOR:A light of recognition fills POLLIVER's eyes, met quickly by ARYA stabbing him through the chin, slowly. He gasps and gurgles. She removes her sword and watches the blood fill his mouth. He chokes, spurts, and dies."

15792,JON: I've been sent to negotiate with you.
15793,NARRATOR:Mance and Jon enter Mance's tent and take a seat
15794,"MANCE: It appears my trusting nature got the better of me. It's happened before. I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us, Jon Snow, truly I was."
15795,"JON: The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black. He made me kill him so you'd trust me. I was loyal, to him and to my Night's Watch vows."
15796,"MANCE: All of your vows? She wasn't enough to turn ya, eh? Were you enough to turn her?"
15797,JON: She put three arrows in me when I escaped.
15798,MANCE: Did you see her again at Castle Black?
15799,JON: Yes.
15800,MANCE: And?
15801,JON: She's dead.
15802,MANCE: Your doing?
15803,JON: No.
15804,MANCE: We'll drink to her.
15805,NARRATOR:One of the Wildlings gets two cups and fills them with liquid. Jon looks at Mance
15806,"MANCE: Of all the ways I'd kill you, poison would be the last."
15807,NARRATOR:They pick up their cups
15808,MANCE: Ygritte.
15809,JON: Ygritte.
15810,NARRATOR:They take a sip and Jon begins to cough
15811,JON: That's not wine.
15812,"MANCE: No, it's a proper Northern drink, Jon Snow. You did well. Fought hard. Killed some of our strongest men. One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again. Mag the Mighty."
15813,JON: He's dead. He killed my friend Grenn.
15814,MANCE: He was their king. Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men.
15815,JON: Grenn came from a farm.
15816,NARRATOR:They lift their cups
15817,MANCE: Mag and Grenn.
15818,JON: Grenn and Mag.
15819,"MANCE: Kullback, could I trouble you for something to eat? I don't imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time. So. You're here to strike a bargain?"
15820,JON: Turn your army around and go home.
15821,MANCE: You know I know you're low on arrows. You're low on oil. You're low on men. How many are left? 50?
15822,JON: I told Tormund and Orell. We have more than a thousand men.
15823,"MANCE: I showed you everything I had. The whole army, a hundred thousand strong, and what did you do? You fired on us with everything you had. It wasn't much. Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall. An unmanned stretch five miles west of here. A lot of them will die climbing, but most of them will be over by the end of the day. This is me being honest with you, Jon Snow, which is more than you've ever done for me. My people have bled enough. We're not here to conquer, we're here to hide behind your wall just like you. We need your tunnel. Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people aren't south of the wall when it comes in earnest, we'll all end up worse than dead. Wanna strike a bargain with me? Here's a bargain. You go back, you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die. Refuse and we'll kill every last man in Castle Black."
15824,NARRATOR:Jon looks over towards the knife. The Wildlings get their weapons ready
15825,"MANCE: Ah! Oh, that's why you're here. I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya. They'd kill you of course, they'd kill ya slow, but ya knew that when you came in here. Are you capable of that, Jon Snow? Killing a man in his own tent when he's just offered ya peace? Is that what the Night's Watch is? Is that what you are?"
15826,"NARRATOR:A horn blows in the distance. Everyone scrambles, Mance draws a knife to Jon's neck"
15827,MANCE: You attacking us?
15828,"JON: No, it's like you said, we don't have the men."
15829,NARRATOR:The Wildlings run around frantically. Men on horseback ride toward them
15830,MANCE: Hold! To me. To me.
15831,"NARRATOR:The horsemen continue toward the Wildlings, killing all in their path. The Wildlings fight back, clearly outnumbered"

15833,NARRATOR:Stannis Baratheon and Davos Seaworth ride up toward Mance Rayder. They get off their horses. Mance disarms himself
15834,STANNIS: You're the king beyond the wall?
15835,NARRATOR:Mance nods
15836,STANNIS: You know who I am?
15837,MANCE: Never had the pleasure.
15838,"DAVOS: This is Stannis Baratheon, the one true king of the seven kingdoms."
15839,MANCE: We're not in the seven kingdoms and you're not dressed for this weather.
15840,STANNIS: It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king.
15841,MANCE: We do not kneel.
15842,"STANNIS: I'll have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall, I'll have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them. I'm not here to slaughter beat dogs. Their fate depends on their king."
15843,"MANCE: All the same, we do not kneel."
15844,STANNIS: Take these men away.
15845,DAVOS: What are men of the Night's Watch doing in a Wildling camp?
15846,JON: I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall.
15847,DAVOS: You're speaking to the one true king boy. You'll address him as your grace.
15848,"JON: I know he's the king. My father died for him. My name is Jon Snow, your grace. I'm Ned Stark's son."
15849,STANNIS: Your father was an honorable man.
15850,"JON: He was, your grace."
15851,STANNIS: What do you think he'd have done with him?
15852,"JON: I was this man's prisoner once. He could've tortured me, he could've killed me, but he spared my life. I think my father would've taken him prisoner, listened to what he had to say."
15853,STANNIS: Very well. *to Davos* Take him.
15854,"JON: Your grace. If my father'd seen the things that I've seen, he'd also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall. All of them."

15856,NARRATOR:Qyburn is seen closely analyzing Gregor's body. He's in Pycelle's lab with Cersei
15857,PYCELLE: I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate.
15858,CERSEI: Bloody Martells.
15859,PYCELLE: The cause appears to be manticore venom.
15860,"QYBURN: It is, yes, manticore."
15861,"PYCELLE: I've read a good deal about it. It's a horrible poison, usually Mantari in origin. Oh! Yes, yes. There's nothing to be done."
15862,QYBURN: Yes there is.
15863,PYCELLE: May I ask what you think you're doing?
15864,QYBURN: Saving him.
15865,"PYCELLE: Your grace. I wish it were otherwise, but Ser Gregor is beyond saving. Well, well beyond. This man is not even a Maester, let alone Grand Maester."
15866,QYBURN: That's for the best. No Maester knows how to save him.
15867,"PYCELLE: That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel, your grace. His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural. Rightly so in my opinion."
15868,"CERSEI: You're dismissed, Grand Maester."
15869,PYCELLE: Your grace. This is my laboratory!
15870,CERSEI: Not anymore.
15871,NARRATOR:Pycelle leaves the laboratory angrily as Qyburn tries to save Gregor's body
15872,CERSEI: You can save him?
15873,"QYBURN: Difficult to say, your grace, but if my past work is any guide. We stand a chance."
15874,CERSEI: Do everything you can. Come to me with anything you need.
15875,"QYBURN: Thank you, your grace. You should know, the process may change him, somewhat."
15876,CERSEI: Will it weaken him?
15877,QYBURN: Oh no.
15878,CERSEI: Very well then.
15879,NARRATOR:Cersei leaves as Qyburn drains Gregor's blood. Cersei is seen arguing with Tywin
15880,"TYWIN: Not another word. We've been over this, the matter's closed."
15881,CERSEI: I'm opening it again.
15882,TYWIN: You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell. Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery.
15883,CERSEI: I will not.
15884,"TYWIN: Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands. Tyrion's sentence will be carried out tomorrow. You have, on several occasions, made great claims about your commitment to this family's future. Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was."
15885,"CERSEI: I don't care. I will stay in King's Landing where I belong with my son, the king."
15886,"TYWIN: When you were nine years old, I was called to the capital. I decided to take your brother with me and not you. You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall-"
15887,CERSEI: I'm not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won. This isn't going to be one of those times.
15888,TYWIN: Do you think you'll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will?
15889,"CERSEI: When you marched into the throne room to tell me we'd won the Battle at Blackwater, do you remember?! I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen. I was about to give him essence of nightshade, that's how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away. Someone awful is coming to take him away."
15890,TYWIN: No.
15891,"CERSEI: Joffrey is dead. Myrcella's been sold like livestock. And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy, my last boy. Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart. I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen."
15892,TYWIN: And how will you do that?
15893,CERSEI: I'll tell everyone the truth.
15894,TYWIN: And what truth would that be?
15895,"CERSEI: You don't know, do you? You never believed it. How is that possible? What am I saying, of course it's possible. How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing? We were right there in front of you and you didn't see us. One look in the past twenty years, one real look and you would've known."
15896,TYWIN: Known what?
15897,CERSEI: Everything they say is true. About Jaime and me.
15898,"TYWIN: No, no, no, no, no."
15899,CERSEI: Your legacy is a lie.
15900,TYWIN: I don't believe you.
15901,CERSEI: Yes you do.
15902,"NARRATOR:Cersei walks away, leaving Tywin standing there alone. Jaime is turning pages in a book in another room"
15903,CERSEI: Jaime.
15904,"JAIME: You won. One fewer brother. Must be proud of yourself. There's really nothing you wouldn't do, is there?"
15905,"CERSEI: For my family, no. I would do things for my family you couldn't imagine."
15906,JAIME: Tyrion is your family.
15907,CERSEI: He's not.
15908,JAIME: You don't get to choose.
15909,"CERSEI: I do, so do you. You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world-"
15910,JAIME: Are you really mad enough to blame him for that? He didn't decide to kill her. He was an infant.
15911,"CERSEI: A disease doesn't decide to kill you, all the same you cut it out before it does. What do you decide? What do you choose?"
15912,"JAIME: The things I did to get back to you, to endure all that, only to find you-"
15913,NARRATOR:Cersei kisses Jaime
15914,CERSEI: I choose you.
15915,JAIME: Those are words.
15916,CERSEI: Yes. Like the ones I just said to father. I told him.
15917,JAIME: Told him what?
15918,CERSEI: I told him about us.
15919,JAIME: You told him?
15920,"CERSEI: I told him I wouldn't marry Loras Tyrell. I told him I'm staying right here with Tommen, with you."
15921,JAIME: You think he'll just accept that?
15922,CERSEI: Go and ask him.
15923,NARRATOR:Cersei kisses Jaime
15924,JAIME: What did you say?
15925,"CERSEI: I don't want to talk about Tywin Lannister. I don't choose Tywin Lannister, I don't love Tywin Lannister. I love my brother. I love my lover. People will whisper, they'll make their jokes. Let them. They're all so small I can't even see them. I only see what matters."
15926,NARRATOR:Cersei kisses Jaime's metal hand. Jaime pulls her close and kisses her
15927,JAIME: Someone will walk in.

15933,"FENNESZ: *in Valyrian* Thank you for seeing me, your grace. My name is Fennesz. I can speak the common tongue if you wish."
15934,DAENERYS: You speak it very well.
15935,"FENNESZ: Before you freed me, I belonged to Master Mighdal. I was tutor to his children. I taught them languages and history. They know a great deal about your family because of me. Little Calla is only seven, but she admires you very much."
15936,DAENERYS: I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration. What can I do for you?
15937,"FENNESZ: When you took the city, the children begged me not to leave the house. But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must. So I lost my home. Now I live on the streets."
15938,DAENERYS: I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them.
15939,"FENNESZ: I do not mean to offend, your grace. I went to one of these places. The young prey on the old. Take what they want and beat us if we resist."
15940,"DAENERYS: My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend, this I promise you."
15941,"FENNESZ: Even if they are safe, who would I be there? What purpose would I serve? With my master, I was a teacher. I had the respect and love of these children."
15942,DAENERYS: What is it that you want from me?
15943,"FENNESZ: Your grace, I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal."
15944,"DAENERYS: You want to return to a man who owned you, like a goat or a chair?"
15945,"FENNESZ: Please, your grace, the young may rejoice in the new world you've built for them. But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor. I am not alone. There are many outside waiting to beg the same-"
15946,DAENERYS: I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy. I took it to bring people freedom. But freedom means making your own choices. I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master. It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year.
15947,"FENNESZ: Thank you, your grace. Thank you."
15948,NARRATOR:Fennesz leaves slowly
15949,BARRISTAN: The masters will take advantage of this situation. The men serving them will be slaves in all but name.
15950,NARRATOR:Another man enters the hall
15951,DAENERYS: Approach my friend.
15952,"MAN: *in Low Valyrian* I do not understand, my queen. I do not understand, my queen."

15954,"MAN: *crying, speaking Low Valyrian*"

16105,ARYA: I’ll last longer than you.
16106,"HOUND: You remember where the heart is? Fuck it. I’m ready. Go on, girl. Another name off your list. You kept promising me. I cut down your butcher’s boy, the ginger. He was begging for mercy. Please sir, please don’t kill me, please, please. Bled all over my horse. Saddle stunk of butcher’s boy for weeks. And your sister, your pretty sister. I should’ve taken her.

16132,"TYRION: All my life, you’ve wanted me dead."
16133,"TYWIN: Yes. But you refused to die. I respect that, even admire it. You fight for what’s yours. I’d never let them execute you; is that what you fear? I’d never let Illyn Payne take your head. You’re a Lannister. You’re my son."
16134,TYRION: I loved her.
16135,TYWIN: Who?

16143,TYWIN: And what? You’ll kill your own father in the privy? No. You’re my son. Enough of this nonsense…

16267,RAMSAY: Father. Welcome home.
16268,"ROOSE: Walda, this is Ramsay Snow, my bastard."
16269,"NARRATOR:RAMSEY steps forward to greet her, warmly smiling."
16270,"RAMSAY: A pleasure, Mother."
16271,NARRATOR:RAMSAY kisses her cheek. WALDA smiles awkwardly.
16272,WALDA: Hello.
16273,"ROOSE: See that the horses are fed, watered, and rubbed down. And take Lady Walda to her chambers."
16274,"WOMAN: This way, my lady."
16275,NARRATOR:WALDA and the WOMAN exit.
16276,ROOSE: Where is your prize?
16277,RAMSAY: With the hounds. I'll have a look at him.
16278,"NARRATOR:ROOSE exits, and RAMSAY greets LOCKE. They walk together"
16279,RAMSAY: I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer.
16280,LOCKE: Word travels. How he screamed. You would have loved it.
16281,RAMSAY: (laughs)
16282,CUT TO: Dreadfort interior.
16283,"NARRATOR:ROOSE sits down by the fire, aching and exhausted from the ride. RAMSAY and THEON enter. A MAN stands in the background, sharpening a shaving razor against a strop."
16284,RAMSAY: Father.
16285,NARRATOR:ROOSE rises to inspect THEON.
16286,ROOSE: What did you do to him?
16287,"RAMSAY: I trained him. He was a slow learner, but he learned."
16288,ROOSE: You flayed him.
16289,RAMSAY: Peeled a few bits. Removed a few others.
16290,ROOSE: This was Balon Greyjoy's son and heir.
16291,"RAMSAY: We've been flaying our enemies for 1,000 years. The flayed man is on our banners."
16292,"ROOSE: My banners, not yours. You're not a Bolton. You're a Snow. Tywin Lannister has given me the North. But he won't lift a finger to help me take it. As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin, our armies are trapped south of the Neck. Theon was a valuable hostage, not your plaything. I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin."
16293,RAMSAY: I already asked. Lord Greyjoy refused. Savages have no...
16294,ROOSE: You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent?
16295,RAMSAY: You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort. I acted.
16296,ROOSE: I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys. I needed Theon. I needed him whole.
16297,"RAMSAY: Theon was our enemy. But Reek, Reek will never betray us."
16298,ROOSE: I placed far too much trust in you.
16299,"RAMSAY: Reek, how could you let me stand before my father unshaven? It's disrespectful."
16300,"THEON:  I'm sorry, my lord."
16301,RAMSAY:  Give him the razor.
16302,NARRATOR:RAMSAY sits.
16303,"RAMSAY: If I'm not a Bolton, Father, what does it matter?"
16304,NARRATOR:THEON stakes the razor and the shaving cream.
16305,"RAMSAY: Go on, Reek. A nice close shave."
16306,NARRATOR:THEON lathers RAMSAY's face and begins to shave it carefully.
16307,"RAMSAY: Reek, tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark?"
16308,"THEON: I don't know, my lord."
16309,ROOSE: You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell.
16310,"RAMSAY: Reek, did you murder the Stark boys?"
16311,"THEON: No, my lord. Just two farm boys."
16312,RAMSAY: And crisped them so no one would know.
16313,"THEON: Yes, my lord."
16314,"RAMSAY: The Starks have always ruled the North. If Bran and Rickon are alive, the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone."
16315,NARRATOR:THEON continues to shave RAMSAY and holds the razor on RAMSAY's throat. RAMSAY goads him.
16316,"RAMSAY: Oh, that's right, Reek. Robb Stark is dead. Sorry. I know he was like a brother to you. But my father put a knife through his heart. How do you feel about that?"
16317,"NARRATOR:THEON's hand twitches, and he struggles with himself. Then he continues to shave RAMSAY slowly."
16318,ROOSE: You ready for a hunt?
16319,"MERYN TRANT: Always. Find those boys and I'll give you 1,000 acres and a holdfast."
16320,LOCKE: Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell?
16321,THEON: Jon Snow is at Castle Black.
16322,LOCKE: Who the fuck is Jon Snow?
16323,ROOSE: Their bastard brother. He could be sheltering them. He may know where they are.
16324,"NARRATOR:RAMSEY stands, cleanly shaven."
16325,"RAMSAY: Even if he doesn't, he's half Stark himself. Could be a threat."
16326,"ROOSE: You want to prove yourself a Bolton? Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin. Bring this creature of yours. Maybe he'll be of some use. Take the Moat for the family, for our family, and I'll reconsider your position."
16327,EXT: King's Landing garden.
16328,NARRATOR:TYRION and PODRICK meet VARYS.
16329,TYRION: Lord Varys. Breakfasting with the king?
16330,VARYS: I'm afraid foreigners aren't welcome at such exclusive affairs.
16331,"TYRION: Oh, to be foreign."
16332,VARYS: Ahem.
16333,NARRATOR:PODRICK stands aside as TYRION and VARYS head down a more secluded path.
16334,VARYS: Shae has been noticed. Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister. It's only a matter of time before your father hears.
16335,TYRION: So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden. My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.
16336,"VARYS: No, I will not. How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying? I have no pet sellsword to protect me. No legendary brother to avenge me. Only little birds who whisper in my ear."
16337,TYRION:  Forgive me if I don't weep for you.
16338,VARYS: No one weeps for spiders or whores. I have friends across the sea who could help her.
16339,"TYRION: She won't leave. I've told her this is a dangerous place so many times, she no longer believes it."
16340,VARYS: Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with. Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat?
16341,NARRATOR:VARYS bows and leaves. TYRION fumes.
16342,EXT: A garden party.
16343,"NARRATOR:SANSA, TYRION, JOFFREY, TYWIN, CERSEI, TOMMEN and PYCELLE sit at an outdoor banquet table. MACE TYRELL stands before them."

16345,NARRATOR:He places the up before JOFFREY.
16346,MACE: May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long.
16347,"JOFFREY: A handsome goblet, my lord. Or shall I call you Father?"
16348,"MACE: I shall be honored, Your Grace."
16349,NARRATOR:MACE bows and exits. SHAE brings a tray to the table and sets it before SANSA.
16350,CERSEI: She's the whore I told you about. The dark-haired one.
16351,NARRATOR:SHAE exits.
16352,TYWIN: Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding.
16353,NARRATOR:TYRION looks concerned. PODRICK places a large tome before JOFFREY and TYRION walks to the front of the table
16354,JOFFREY: A book?
16355,"TYRION:  ""The Lives of Four Kings."" Grand Maester Kaeth's history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon, Baelor the Blessed, Aegon the Unworthy, and Daeron the Good. A book every king should read."
16356,NARRATOR:JOFFREY is at a loss for words. TYWIN entreats him to respond.
16357,"JOFFREY: Now that the war is won, we should all find time for wisdom. Thank you, Uncle."
16358,NARRATOR:TYRION bows. SHAE watches. The MOUNTAIN brings forth a sword and lays it on the table before JOFFREY. TYWIN stands.
16359,"TYWIN: One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital, Your Grace, freshly forged in your honor."
16360,"NARRATOR:Excitedly, JOFFREY walks around the table. Exuberantly, he unsheaths the sword."
16361,"PYCELLE: Careful, Your Grace. Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel."
16362,JOFFREY: So they say.
16363,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY steps away, then spins and cleaves the book that TYRION just gave him, repeatedly. People gasp in response. JOFFREY is very pleased."
16364,JOFFREY: Such a great sword should have a name. What shall I call her?
16365,MAN: Stormbringer.
16366,MAN #2: Terminus.
16367,MAN #3: Widow's Wail.
16368,MAN #4: Wolfsbane. -
16369,"JOFFREY: Widow's Wail. I like that. Every time I use it, it'll be like cutting off. Ned Stark's head all over again."
16370,NARRATOR:JOFFREY sheaths the sword. SANSA looks dejected. He sits down next to MACE and SHAE continues to look on.
16371,INT: TYRION's chambers
16372,"NARRATOR:The door opens and SHAE walks in, smiling."
16373,TYRION: Don't.
16374,"SHAE: You want me on the desk? What's wrong, my lion?"
16375,TYRION: Don't call me that.
16376,SHAE: What should I call you?
16377,TYRION: I'm afraid our friendship can't continue.
16378,SHAE: Our friendship?
16379,TYRION: There's a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos.
16380,"SHAE: What? You'll have your own cabin, of course, and across the Narrow Sea a house, servants."
16381,SHAE: What is this?
16382,"TYRION: I'm a married man. My wife has suffered a great deal, as you well know. I don't want her to suffer anymore on my account. I need to uphold my vows."
16383,SHAE: She doesn't want you.
16384,TYRION:  I need to do right by her.
16385,SHAE: You don't want her.
16386,TYRION:  By our children.
16387,SHAE: What are you afraid of?
16388,TYRION:  I'm not afraid.
16389,SHAE: You are. You are afraid of your father and your sister. You're going to run from them all your life?  I need you to leave.
16390,SHAE: I'm not afraid of them. I'm not going to run.
16391,TYRION:  Shae.
16392,"SHAE: We will fight them together. It's like you said, I am yours and you are mine."
16393,"TYRION: You're a whore! Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not. I can't be in love with a whore. I can't have children with a whore. How many men have you been with? 500? 5,000?"
16394,SHAE: How many whores have you been with?
16395,TYRION: I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all. But now that time is over.
16396,NARRATOR:TYRION walks over and opens the door. SHAE sobs. BRONN enters.
16397,TYRION: You'll have a comfortable life in Pentos. Bronn will escort you to your ship.
16398,"NARRATOR:SHAE continues to sob. BRONN clasps her shoulder to lead her out. She turns quickly and slaps him, then storms off, crying. BRONN looks to TYRION, then exits. TYRION walks to the table and violently slaps his cup to the ground."
16399,EXT: Stannis's army camp in the  Stormlands at night.
16400,"NARRATOR:A woman screams. A line of men are bound on top of unlit bonfires, including AXELL FLORENT. The soldiers mill about, carrying torches."
16401,"MELISANDRE: Hear us now. Accept these tokens of our faith, my lord, and lead us from the darkness."
16402,"AXELL FLORENT: Sire, I served you well."
16403,NARRATOR:The crowd chants along with MELISANDRE
16404,"MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, show us the way..."
16405,"AXELL FLORENT: Selyse, you're my sister!"
16406,SELYSE: (Chanting with the others) Yours are the stars that guide us.
16407,AXELL FLORENT: Tell him! Tell him!
16408,"MELISANDRE: Lord of Light, protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors."
16409,NARRATOR:The bonfires ignite quickly. The men scream in agony and die.
16410,SELYSE: (to STANNIS) Did you see? Their souls. It was their souls. Our lord took them. Did you see?
16411,NARRATOR:STANNIS leaves without responding. DAVOS trails him.
16412,DAVOS: Lord Florent was your brother by law. STANNIS; He was an infidel.
16413,"DAVOS: He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him. They were the gods of your fathers, too."
16414,STANNIS: I ordered him to tear down his idols. He disobeyed.
16415,DAVOS: How many ships did he bring to your 'cause? How many men?
16416,STANNIS: A good deal more than you.
16417,"NARRATOR:STANNIS exits and SELYSE catches up, accompanied by MELISANDRE."
16418,"SELYSE: Did you see, Ser Davos? They're with our lord now. Their sins all burned away. Did you see?"
16419,"DAVOS: I'm sure they're more than grateful, my queen."
16420,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE walks past DAVOS and he watches, silently."
16421,INT: Storm's End Dining room
16422,NARRATOR:Stannis sits at table with SELYSE and MELISANDRE.
16423,STANNIS: Meat's off.
16424,SELYSE: Our larders are almost empty.
16425,"STANNIS: Serve fish, then. We're on an island."
16426,SELYSE: You hate fish.
16427,"STANNIS: I hate a good many things, but I suffer them all the same."
16428,"SELYSE: (to MELISANDRE) When Storm's End was under siege and I was starving, Stannis boiled soup for me from books. The binding glue is made from horses. One morning, he shot two seagulls on the beach. I've never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull. Do you remember?"
16429,STANNIS: Of course I remember.
16430,"SELYSE: Have you ever known true hunger, my lady?"
16431,MELISANDRE: It's all I knew when I was a child.
16432,SELYSE: Until you found the Lord of Light?
16433,MELISANDRE: Until he found me.
16434,SELYSE: I fear for our daughter's soul.
16435,MELISANDRE: Every mother should fear for her child's soul.
16436,SELYSE: She's a stubborn little beast.
16437,STANNIS:  She's a child.
16438,SELYSE: You barely know her. You think she's sweet because she smiles when you visit. She's sullen and stubborn and sinful. Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face? She needs the rod.
16439,STANNIS: She's my daughter. You will not strike her.
16440,SELYSE: As you command. Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her.
16441,INT: SHIREEN's bedroom after dinner.
16442,NARRATOR:A knock on the door.
16443,SHIREEN: Come in.
16444,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE enters.
16445,"MELISANDRE: Were you sleeping, Princess?"
16446,SHIREEN: (Shakes her head)
16447,MELISANDRE:  Did you watch the ceremony on the beach?
16448,SHIREEN: I heard it.
16449,MELISANDRE: And it frightened you?
16450,SHIREEN: Ser Axell was my uncle. He was always kind to me.
16451,"MELISANDRE: They're in a better place now, Princess. The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world."
16452,SHIREEN: But they screamed.
16453,MELISANDRE: Women scream when they give birth. Afterward they are filled with joy.
16454,SHIREEN: Afterward they aren't ash and bone.
16455,"MELISANDRE: You have so many questions, don't you? So did I when I was a child. I was much like you. Only I wasn't a princess."
16456,SHIREEN: And you didn't have this.
16457,"MELISANDRE: No. But I suffered in other ways, sweet girl, believe me. What do you know of the gods?"
16458,"SHIREEN: I read ""The Seven-Pointed Star."""
16459,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE sits next to SHIREEN to comfort her.
16460,"MELISANDRE: Lies and fables. Septons speak of seven gods. There are but two... a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness, evil, and fear. Eternally at war."
16461,SHIREEN: There are no seven heavens and no seven hells?
16462,"MELISANDRE: There's only one hell, Princess. The one we live in now."
16463,EXT: The North at night.
16464,"Heavy breathing as the camera pans through the snowy woods. Suddenly, the camera lurches forward and comes upon a deer and the camera attacks viciously,  a wolf's hunt from the predator's point of view.  Hodor: Hodor."
16465,"CUT TO: Bran awakening. HODOR, MEERA and JOJEN are with him. BRAN is frantic and panting."
16466,BRAN: Why did you wake me?
16467,MEERA: You've been gone for hours.
16468,BRAN: I was hungry.
16469,MEERA: We're all hungry.
16470,BRAN: I was just eating.
16471,"JOJEN: Summer was eating. Your body can't live on the food your wolf consumes. Spending too much time in Summer's skin is dangerous. You're not a direwolf, Bran."
16472,NARRATOR:BRAN eats some morsels given to him by MEERA.
16473,"JOJEN: Must be glorious, though. To run, to leap, to hunt. To be whole. I know that's tempting, but if you're trapped in Summer for too long, you'll forget what it was to be human."
16474,"MEERA: You'd forget us, Bran. You'd forget your mother and father. You'd forget your brothers and sisters. You'd forget Winterfell. You'd forget you. And if we lose you, we lose everything."
16475,EXT: The North.
16476,"NARRATOR:HODOR pulls BRAN through the woods on a sled. MEERA and JOJEN walk beside them. A wolf barks. They pause and BRAN turns to see his wolf, Summer."
16477,"BRAN: Hodor, take me to the tree."
16478,"NARRATOR:HODOR carries BRAN to the base of the tree, sets him down and steps back. The bark seems to have twisted into a human face. BRAN touches it and launches into a vision of the Godswood, a THREE-EYED RAVEN, a sword, NED STARK's worried face, the Godswood again. Time speeds forward."
16479,THREE-EYED RAVEN: Look for me... beneath the tree.
16480,"NARRATOR:The THREE-EYED RAVEN lands on the branch of a Godswood. A storm of crows flies into a standing BRAN. A castle interior, an undead horse,"
16481,CERSEI: He saw us.
16482,NARRATOR:BRAN falls from the Winterfell tower. A dragon's shadow sweeps over King's Landing.
16483,THREE-EYED RAVEN: North.
16484,NARRATOR:BRAN gasps and releases his hand from the twisted face on the tree. The vision has ended. MEERA and JOJEN approach.
16485,BRAN: I know where we have to go.
16486,"INT: King's Landing, the Sept of Baelor."
16487,NARRATOR:MARGAERY and MACE walk down the aisle. MACE hands her to JOFFREY. The pair continue up the steps to the HIGH SEPTON. He places a cape over her shoulders. They clasp hands and they bar bound together.
16488,"HIGH SEPTON: Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart, one flesh, one soul. Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder."

16494,NARRATOR:TYWIN and OLENNA talk in the garden as the wedding guests filter out.
16495,"TYWIN: Bit much, wouldn't you say?"
16496,OLENNA:  It feels proportionate.
16497,TYWIN:  Proportionate to what?
16498,OLENNA: The expected extravagance.
16499,TYWIN: People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long.
16500,OLENNA: You ought to try enjoying something before you die. You might find it suits you.
16501,NARRATOR:MACE approaches and ties to join them.
16502,"OLENNA: Not now, Mace. Lord Tywin and I are speaking."
16503,"NARRATOR:TYWIN and OLENNA continue, while MACE rears back."
16504,"OLENNA: Anyway, I don't know what you're complaining about. I'm paying my share."
16505,TYWIN: Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity?
16506,"OLENNA: No, your heartfelt thank-you is it's own reward. I would imagine I'd be hearing it again before long. Wars are rather expensive. ""The Iron Bank will have it's due."" How they love to remind everyone. Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts."
16507,TYWIN: I'm not worried about the Iron Bank.
16508,"OLENNA: We both know you're smarter than that. Come, Tywin, let us celebrate young love."
16509,NARRATOR:CUT TO; The wedding reception.
16510,"NARRATOR:Jugglers and firebreathers, some on stilts, entertain the crowd. BRONN, TYRION and PODRICK walk among the tables."

16512,TYRION: You saw her board the ship?
16513,"BRONN: Aye, she's on it."
16514,TYRION: You saw the ship sail away?
16515,"BRONN: No one knows she's there but you, me, and Varys."
16516,TYRION: How do you know?
16517,"BRONN: Because if someone follows me without an invitation, I'm the last person they ever follow."
16518,TYRION: There's someone following you?
16519,NARRATOR:BRONN turns and clasps TYRION's shoulder.
16520,"BRONN: She's gone. I know you don't want to believe it, but she is. Now, go drink till it feels like you did the right thing."
16521,NARRATOR:BRONN exits.
16522,NARRATOR:TYRION and PODRICK walk through the party. They encounter OBERYN and ELLARIA.

16527,CUT TO: The head table.
16528,NARRATOR:JOFFREY watches the party. OLENNA approaches SANSA.
16529,"OLENNA: You look exquisite, child. The wind has been at you, though. I haven't had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother. War is war, but killing a man at a wedding, horrid. What sort of monster would do such a thing? As if men need more reasons to fear marriage."
16530,NARRATOR:TYRION enters and sits.
16531,TYRION: My lady. My lady.
16532,"OLENNA: Lord Tyrion, you see? Not as bad as all that. Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes, he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit. Now that peace has come and all is right with the world, it would do you good to see some of it. You must excuse me. It's time I ate some of this food I paid for."
16533,"MUSICIAN: A coat of gold / Or a coat of red / A lion still has claws And mine,  my lord..."
16534,"NARRATOR:MARGAERY is enjoying the performance, but JOFFREY is bored. He stands and throws some coins to them."
16535,JOFFREY: Very good. Very good. Off you go.
16536,"NARRATOR:The musicians scrabble to pick up the coins, and depart quickly. MARGAERY moves to calm JOFFREY. CERSEI watches jealously, TOMMEN at her side.  MARGAERY; My love, why don't we make the announcement?"
16537,NARRATOR:JOFFREY stands and clanks his goblet for attention.
16538,JOFFREY: Everyone. The queen would like to say a few words.
16539,NARRATOR:The crowd applauds as JOFFREY sits and MARGAERY stands.
16540,"MARGAERY: We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink. Not all among us are so lucky. To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end, King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city."
16541,"NARRATOR:The crowd applauds, and JOFFREY adores it. CERSEI comes over to MARGAERY."
16542,CERSEI: You're an example to us all.
16543,NARRATOR:CERSEI kisses her on each cheek.
16544,"NARRATOR:LORAS stands in the distance, and catches OBERYN's eye as he cuddles with ELLARIA. LORAS accidentally backs into JAIME."

16547,LORAS: As does yours.
16548,"JAIME: So, looking forward to your wedding?"
16549,"LORAS: Yes, very much."
16550,JAIME: Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect.
16551,LORAS: They certainly are.
16552,"JAIME: Perhaps they should get married. If you were to marry Cersei, she'd murder you in your sleep. If you somehow managed to put a child in her first, she'd murder him, too, long before he drew his first breath. Luckily for you, none of this will happen because you'll never marry her."
16553,LORAS: And neither will you.
16554,"NARRATOR:LORAS pats JAIME on the shoulder, and exits. BRIENNE approaches the head table, and bows."
16555,NARRATOR:MARGAERY stands and shakes her hand.
16556,MARGAERY:  Lady Brienne. So good of you to come.
16557,"BRIENNE: I'm no lady, Your Grace."
16558,CERSEI: Did you just bow?
16559,"BRIENNE: Apologies, Your Grace. I never did master the curtsy."
16560,JOFFREY: You're the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon.
16561,"MARGAERY: That's not true, my love. Brienne had nothing to do with it."
16562,JOFFREY: A shame. I'd knight the man that put an end to that deviant's life.
16563,BRIENNE:  I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune. The country has been at war too long. I hope your reign is long and peaceful.
16564,"JOFFREY: Yes, yes."
16565,MARGAERY: Thank you. I hope we see more of you.
16566,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE departs, and the camera follows her. CERSEI intercepts her."
16567,CERSEI: Lady Brienne. You're Lord Selwyn Tarth's daughter. That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not.
16568,"BRIENNE: As you say, Your Grace."
16569,CERSEI: I owe you my gratitude. You returned my brother safely to King's Landing.
16570,"BRIENNE: In truth, he rescued me, Your Grace. More than once."
16571,CERSEI: Did he? Haven't heard that story before.
16572,"BRIENNE:  Not such a fascinating story, I'm afraid."
16573,CERSEI: I'm sure you have many fascinating stories. Sworn to Renly Baratheon. Sworn to Catelyn Stark. And now my brother. Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy.
16574,"BRIENNE: I don't serve your brother, Your Grace."
16575,CERSEI: But you love him.
16576,NARRATOR:BREINNE does not answer.
16577,BRIENNE: Your Grace.
16578,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE exits, and JAIME notices their conversation."
16579,NARRATOR:CUT TO; The head table.
16580,NARRATOR:PYCELLE has cornered a maid.
16581,"PYCELLE: No, no, come to my chambers and I will examine you personally."
16582,CERSEI:  She'll do no such thing.
16583,"PYCELLE: Oh, Your Grace. Yes, well, this young lady sought my advice..."
16584,CERSEI: You should see Qyburn. He's quite good.
16585,MAID: Your Grace.
16586,NARRATOR:The MAID exits.
16587,PYCELLE:  Qyburn? Deplorable man. Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments.
16588,CERSEI: More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girl's thighs?
16589,"PYCELLE: Your Grace, I am a man of learning."
16590,CERSEI: My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him. What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me?
16591,PYCELLE: I never meant to annoy anyone.
16592,CERSEI: But you are. You annoy me right now. Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me. So here's what I want you to do. I want you to leave my presence. Leave this wedding right now. Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels.
16593,"PYCELLE: Your Grace, Queen Margaery..."
16594,CERSEI: The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will.
16595,"NARRATOR:PYCELLE exits, and CERSEI smiles."
16596,"CUT: the head table, where JOFFREY and MARGAERY watch a fool juggling. Once again, JOFFREY is not amused. He stands."
16597,JOFFREY: A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fool's hat off.
16598,"NARRATOR:The fool is suddenly pelted with food, and he runs off. CERSEI and TYWIN enter."
16599,TYWIN: You're in rather a good mood.
16600,CERSEI: I suppose I am.
16601,TYWIN: I won't ask why.
16602,CERSEI: Small pleasures.
16603,NARRATOR:OBERYN and ELLARIA enter.
16604,OBERYN: Your Grace. Lord Tywin.
16605,TYWIN: Prince Oberyn.
16606,"OBERYN: I don't believe you have met Ellaria. This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent. I suppose it is former Queen Regent now. Lord Hand and Lady Cersei, Ellaria Sand."
16607,ELLARIA:  My lord. My lady.
16608,TYWIN: Charmed.
16609,CERSEI: Can't say I've ever met a Sand before.
16610,"ELLARIA: We are everywhere in Dorne. I have 10,000 brothers and sisters."
16611,"OBERYN: Bastards are born of passion, aren't they? We don't despise them in Dorne."
16612,CERSEI: No? How tolerant of you.
16613,"OBERYN: I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities. Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked."
16614,"CERSEI: I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn. It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding."
16615,"TYWIN: Please give him our regards. With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again."
16616,OBERYN: They call it the rich man's disease. A wonder you don't have it.
16617,TYWIN: Noblemen in my part of the country don't enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne.
16618,"OBERYN: People everywhere have their differences. In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth. In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful. What a fortunate thing for you, former Queen Regent, that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place."
16619,NARRATOR:JOFFREY taps his goblet.
16620,"JOFFREY: Everyone, silence! Clear the floor. There's been too much amusement here today. A royal wedding is not an amusement. A royal wedding is history. The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history. My lords... my ladies..."
16621,NARRATOR:A lever is pulled. A giant lion's mouth opens. A red carpet rolls down.
16622,"JOFFREY: I give you. King Joffrey... Renly, Stannis, Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy. The War of the Five Kings."
16623,"NARRATOR:Five dwarves come down from the lion's mouth, each dressed as one of the five kings. They run about,  playing their roles with comic glee. The crowd applauds. JOFFREY is very pleased. TYRION, less so."

16625,ROBB DWARF: King in the North!

16634,"RENLY DWARF: Ooh, careful."
16635,STANNIS DWARF:  Go on.
16636,RENLY DWARF: I want you to be my prince. Stannis!
16637,NARRATOR:STANNIS DWARF and RENLY DWARF feign some indecent acts. LORAS leaves in disgust.
16638,"BALON DWARF: Who's got the gold now, Stark?"
16639,ROBB DWARF: I am the rightful king.
16640,"BALON DWARF: Challenge me, ruffian."
16641,ROBB DWARF: Take that. -
16642,BALON DWARF:  I'm drowning. I'm drowning.
16643,ROBB DWARF: I am the King in the North!
16644,NARRATOR:TYRION and SANSA are not amused.

16647,"NARRATOR:The crowd applauds. STANNIS DWARF runs off the stage, crying."
16648,TYRON: Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done.
16649,"PODRICK: Yes, my lord."
16650,TYRION: We'll have to find another way to thank the king.
16651,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY is enjoying the spectacle, but MARGAERY is not."
16652,NARRATOR:JOFFREY DWARF and ROBB DWARF are having a stand off.
16653,JOFFREY DWARF: Charge!
16654,NARRATOR:They run past one another without landing a blow.

16656,JOFFREY DWARF: Charge! Yes!
16657,"NARRATOR:This time, JOFFREY DWARD knocks off ROBB DWARF""s wolf helmet."
16658,JOFFREY DWARF: Your head!
16659,"NARRATOR:SANSA is mortified. JOFFREY laughs hysterically while MARGAERY looks at him, appalled."
16660,NARRATOR:ROBB DWARF falls. The crowd applauds. JOFFREY DWARF claims victory.
16661,NARRATOR:JOFFREY grabs his golbet.
16662,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY DWARF feigns sodomizing the wolf head. SANSA is motionless. JOFFREY spits out his wine, laughing."
16663,JOFFREY DWARF: Fine gentlemen.
16664,NARRATOR:The players take their bow and the crowd applauds. JOFFREY stands.
16665,"JOFFREY: Well fought. Well fought. Here you are. Champion's purse. Though you're not the champion yet, are you? A true champion defeats all the challengers. Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign. Uncle How about you? I'm sure they have a spare costume."
16666,NARRATOR:The crowd laughs. Tyrion stands.
16667,"TYRION: One taste of combat was enough for me, Your Grace. I would like to keep what remains of my face. I think you should fight him. This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle. I speak as a firsthand witness. Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne. Be careful, though. This one is clearly mad with lust. It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night."
16668,"NARRATOR:TYRION sits, and JOFFREY is angered at his insults. The crowd quiets. JOFFREY walks over and pours his wine on TYRION's head. MARGAERY sits motionless."
16669,TYRION: A fine vintage. Shame that it spilled.
16670,JOFFREY: It did not spill.
16671,"MARGAERY: My love, come back to me. It's time for my father's toast."
16672,"JOFFREY: Well, how does he expect me to toast without wine? Uncle, you can be my cupbearer seeing as you're too cowardly to fight."
16673,TYRION: Your Grace does me a great honor.
16674,JOFFREY: It's not meant as an honor.
16675,"NARRATOR:TYRION stands and walks over to JOFFREY, who purposely drops his goblet. As TYRION tried to pick it up, he kicks it away."
16676,JOFFREY:  Bring me my goblet.
16677,NARRATOR:TYRION kneels down to get the goblet. SANSA watches JOFFREY. She picks up the goblet and hands it to TYRION. He brings it to JOFFREY.
16678,JOFFREY: What good is an empty cup? Fill it.
16679,"NARRATOR:TYRION pours wine for JOFFREY in front of CERSEI, and hands it to him."
16680,JOFFREY: Kneel. Kneel before your king.
16681,NARRATOR:TYRION does not budge.
16682,JOFFREY: Kneel. I said... kneel!
16683,"MARGAERY: (Standing) Look, the pie."
16684,"NARRATOR:The crowd applauds, and the attention turns to the giant pie carried in by four men."
16685,JOFFREY: My queen.
16686,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY strides forward, and hews the pie with his sword. To his surprise, doves are released from the pie. He looks triumphant."

16688,NARRATOR:The pie is served to the guests.
16689,SANSA:  Can we leave now?
16690,TYRION:  Let's find out.
16691,NARRATOR:MARGAERY feeds a forkful of pie to JOFFREY.
16692,"JOFFREY: Uncle. Where are you going? You're my cupbearer, remember?"
16693,"TYRION: I thought I might change out of these wet clothes, Your Grace."
16694,"JOFFREY: No, no, no. No, you're perfect the way you are. Serve me my wine."
16695,NARRATOR:TYRION looks to SANSA.
16696,"JOFFREY: Well, hurry up. This pie is dry."
16697,NARRATOR:TYRION and fumes has he gets the goblet for JOFFREY. JOFFREY drinks deeply.
16698,"JOFFREY: Mm, good. Needs washing down."
16699,"TYRION: If it please Your Grace, Lady Sansa is very tired."
16700,"JOFFREY: No. (coughing) No, you'll wait here... un..."
16701,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY grabs his own throat, choking."
16702,TYRION: Your Grace?
16703,JOFFREY: It's nothing.
16704,MARGAERY: He's choking!
16705,OLENNA: Help the poor boy.
16706,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY turns towards the crowd, choking and staggering."
16707,"OLENNA: Idiots, help your king. -"
16708,JAIME: Move away!
16709,"NARRATOR:JAIME runs to JOFFREY, as he vomits."
16710,JAIME: Joffrey! Joffrey!
16711,NARRATOR:CERSEI runs to them.
16712,CERSEI:  Help him! Someone help him!
16713,JOFFREY: (gags)
16714,CERSEI: Joffrey!
16715,SER DONTOS: (to SANSA) Come with me now.
16716,CERSEI: Joffrey! Joffrey!
16717,"NARRATOR:TYRION and MARGAERY watch, aghast. CERSEI and JAIME continue to try to help JOFFREY."
16718,"SER DONTOS: If you want to live, we have to leave."
16719,CERSEI: Don't touch him!
16720,"NARRATOR:JOFFREY gurgles and chokens. His face is turning purple, his eyes glazed, vomit lining his cheeks. He spasms."
16721,"CERSEI: Joffrey. Please, Joffrey. Joffrey, what is it? Help him!"
16722,"NARRATOR:Blood streams out of JOFFREY's nose. He convulses painfully. CERSEI cries as she watches him. He reaches a hand out towards TYRION, who at that moment picks up the goblet from before him. JOFFREY gaps a final time as blood continues to stream from his nose, his face a horrid shade of purple. He dies."
16723,CERSEI: My son.
16724,MAN: He's gone. Our king is gone.
16725,"CERSEI: He did this. He poisoned my son, your king. Take him. Take him! Take him! Take him!"

16734,CERSEI: Where is his wife? Where's Sansa?
16735,TYWIN: Find her. Bar the gates of the city. Seize every ship in the harbor.
16736,CERSEI: Where is she?!
16737,TYWIN: No one leaves the capital! No one!
16738,NARRATOR:EXT. KINGS LANDING DOCK AT DUSK
16739,"NARRATOR:A bell tolls as Sansa and Ser Dontos rush down to a small boat, separate from the Harbor."
16740,SER DONTOS: Get in.
16741,SANSA: Where are we going?
16742,SER DONTOS: Somewhere safe.
16743,"NARRATOR:Sansa and Ser Dontos sail out into the ocean, far from King's Landing."
16744,NARRATOR:EXT. MISTY OCEAN AT NIGHT
16745,NARRATOR:They come across a huge mysterious ship in the middle of the misty sea. Ser Dontos pulls his smaller boat up alongside it.
16746,"SER DONTOS: Up you go, my lady. You'll be fine. You're stronger than you know."
16747,NARRATOR:Sansa climbs the latter.
16748,"NARRATOR:EXT. LITTLEFINGER'S SHIP, MOMENTS LATER"
16749,"NARRATOR:She climbs up a ladder on the side of the ship, as she reaches the top someone grabs her. She gasps before realizing who it is."
16750,SANSA: Lord Baelish?
16751,"LITTLEFINGER: Petyr... Are you hurt, my lady?"
16752,SANSA: (shakes her head.)
16753,LITTLEFINGER: Good. Good. I'm sure you've had quite a fright. Rest easy. The worst is past.  Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat.
16754,SER DONTOS: Lord Baelish. I promised I'd get her to you safely.
16755,"LITTLEFINGER: Softly, my friend... Voices carry over water."
16756,"SER DONTOS: I should get back before someone thinks to look for me.  LITTLEFINGER First you'll want your pay. 10,000 was it?"
16757,"SER DONTOS: 10,000."
16758,NARRATOR:Littlefinger clicks his finger and two men with crossbows walk to the edge of the ship. They aim at Ser Dontos.
16759,SER DONTOS: Wait!
16760,"NARRATOR:Both men shoot at Ser Dontos, he groans in pain before lying dead. Sansa screams and Littlefinger hushes her."
16761,"LITTLEFINGER: Shh. You don't want the queen to hear, do you? 1,000 gold cloaks are searching for you. And if they found you, how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king?"
16762,SANSA: I didn't murder anyone.
16763,"LITTLEFINGER: I know. I know. But you must admit it looks suspicious. The king who executed your father, who tormented you for years, and you fled the scene of his murder."
16764,NARRATOR:Sansa glances back to Ser Dontos' body.
16765,SANSA: Why did you kill him?
16766,LITTLEFINGER: Because he was a drunk and a fool and I don't trust drunk fools.
16767,SANSA: He saved me.
16768,"LITTLEFINGER: Saved you? My lady, he followed my orders. Every one of them. And he did it all for gold. Money buys a man's silence for a time. A bolt in the heart buys it forever."
16769,SANSA: He was helping me because I saved his life.
16770,"LITTLEFINGER: Yes, and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother. The last legacy of House Hollard."
16771,"NARRATOR:Littlefinger removes the necklace from around Sansa's neck and places it on the edge of the ship. He pull out a knife and hits one of the ""crystals"" and it smashes like glass. Sansa, confused, studies him."
16772,LITTLEFINGER: I had it made a few weeks ago. What did I once tell you about the capital?
16773,SANSA: We're all liars here.
16774,NARRATOR:Littlefinger pushes the necklace off the edge of the boat and it lands directly on Ser Dontos' lifeless body.
16775,"LITTLEFINGER: Come, my lady. I know you've had a difficult day. But you're safe now. I promise you that. You're safe with me and sailing home."
16776,NARRATOR:Margaery Tyrell sits at the table with Olenna Tyrell.
16777,MARGAERY: So am I the queen?
16778,"OLENNA: More than you were with Renly. Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying. In any case, this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue."
16779,"MARGAERY: Clawing at his own throat, looking to his mother to make stop... it was horrible."
16780,"OLENNA: The world is overflowing with horrible things. But they're all a tray of cakes next to death. They brought me your grandfather's body when he died, you know? Made me look at it."
16781,MARGAERY: What was it like?
16782,OLENNA: They took me to the Great Hall and there he was. The man I'd married and suffered to father my children. A great doughy lump I'd sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings. There he was... lying on a table.
16783,MARGAERY: One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart. Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast... I must be cursed.
16784,"OLENNA: Nonsense. Your circumstances have improved markedly. You may not have enjoyed watching him die, but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him, I can promise you that."
16785,MARGAERY: But I would have been the queen.
16786,OLENNA: Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us. You did wonderful work on Joffrey. The next one should be easier.
16787,"NARRATOR:Joffrey's body is laid on a table in the center on the room. Cersei, Tommen and Tywin and stand around him. Tywin turns to Tommen."
16788,TYWIN: Your brother is dead. Do you know what that means?
16789,NARRATOR:Tommen stays quiet.
16790,TYWIN: I'm not trying to trick you.
16791,TOMMEN: It means I'll become king.
16792,"TYWIN: Yes, you will become king. What kind of king do you think you'll be?"
16793,TOMMEN: A good king?
16794,"TYWIN: Mm, I think so as well. You've got the right temperament for it. But what makes a good king? Hmm? What is a good king's single most important quality?"
16795,CERSEI: This is hardly the place or the time.
16796,TOMMEN: Holiness?
16797,TYWIN: Hmm. Baelor the Blessed was holy. And pious. He built this sept. He also named a six-year-old boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles. He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful.
16798,TOMMEN: Justice.
16799,TYWIN: Yeah. A good king must be just. Orys I was just. Everyone applauded his reforms. Nobles and commoners alike. But he wasn't just for long. He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother. Was that truly just of him? To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize?
16800,TOMMEN: No.
16801,TYWIN: No.
16802,TOMMEN: What about strength?
16803,"TYWIN: Yes. Strength. King Robert was strong. He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty. And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years. He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him. So, we have a man who starves himself to death, a man who lets his own brother murder him, and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing. What do they all lack?"
16804,TOMMEN: Wisdom.
16805,TYWIN: Yes!
16806,TOMMEN: Wisdom is what makes a good king.
16807,TYWIN: Yes. But what is wisdom? Hmm? A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you. How do you know which choice is wise and which isn't? You've any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers?
16808,TOMMEN: No.
16809,"TYWIN: No. Of course not. A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesn't. You're young. A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age. And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards... Your brother was not a wise king. Your brother was not a good king. If he had been, perhaps he'd still be alive. Now, as the king, you will have to marry. Do you understand why?"
16810,NARRATOR:Tywin and Tommen begin walking up the steps to leave the Sept.
16811,TOMMEN: A king needs a queen.
16812,"TYWIN: Yes, but why? To further the family line. Do you know how that happens?"
16813,TOMMEN: Yes.
16814,"TYWIN: Yes, but has anyone explained the details to you?"
16815,TOMMEN: I don't think so. It's all relatively straightforward.
16816,NARRATOR:JAIME enters.
16817,JAIME: How are you?
16818,TOMMEN:  I'm all right.
16819,JAIME:You are. You will be. I'll see to that.
16820,NARRATOR:TYWIN and TOMMEN exit.
16821,JAIME: Please give the queen a moment alone with her son.

16870,ARYA: We were just watering the horses. We'll be on our way. Forgive my father. He was wounded fighting in the war. Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it.

16887,FARMER HAMLET: Did you fight at the Twins?
16888,HOUND: Call that a fight? Slaughtering livestock more like.
16889,FARMER HAMLET: The Red Wedding they're calling it. Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day. He shared bread and salt with the Starks. He offered them guest right.
16890,HOUND: Guest right don't mean much anymore.
16891,"FARMER HAMLET: It means something to me. The gods will have their vengeance. Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did. Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands. We had good years and bad years, same as anyone. But we were safe. Now with the Freys, raiders come plundering, steal our food, steal our silver. I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother, but the north's no better. The whole country's gone sour."
16892,HOUND: You got any ale?
16893,FARMER HAMLET:  Afraid not.
16894,HOUND: How can a man not keep ale in his home?
16895,"FARMER HAMLET:  You look like you could really swing that sword. A real warrior with proper training. Those raiders wouldn't stand a chance against you. How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon? I could use a man to help with the farmwork. Sally does what she can, but she can't lift a bale of hay. And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings, one look at you, I'd bet they'd run the other way. Meaning no offense."
16896,HOUND: What'll you pay? I don't have much. But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits. Fair wages for fair work?

16904,HOUND: I wasn't.
16905,ARYA: He took us in. He fed us and you...
16906,"HOUND: Aye, he took us in. He's a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew. And they'll both be dead come winter."
16907,ARYA: You don't know that.
16908,HOUND: I do know it. He's weak. He can't protect himself. They'll both be dead come winter. Dead men don't need silver.
16909,ARYA: You're the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms.

16971,DAVOS: They've never broken a contract.
16972,STANNIS: They're sellswords.
16973,"DAVOS: We're willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne, but we're not willing to pay men to fight? Now the Red Woman's magic is real. Her visions and prophecies may be, too, but I've never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war. Soldiers win wars. Soldiers on the ground. It's dirty on the ground."

16993,SHIREEN: What's the difference?
16994,"DAVOS: Well, if you're a famous smuggler, you're not doing it right."
16995,SHIREEN: My father says a criminal is a criminal.
16996,DAVOS: Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior. So do the Braavosi.
16997,SHIREEN: You've sailed to Braavos?
16998,"DAVOS:  Of course. Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos. I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers, but he didn't seem any more interested in the distinction than your father. I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom, you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction..."

Have they announced the judges yet?"
17122,PODRICK: Your father.
17123,TYRION: Of course.
17124,PODRICK: Mace Tyrell.
17125,TYRION: Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote.
17126,PODRICK: And Prince Oberyn of Dorne.
17127,TYRION: Oberyn? Give it to my father. He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy.
17128,"PODRICK: I'm supposed to get a list of names from you, my lord. Anyone who might testify on your behalf."
17129,"TYRION: Oh, I can call my own witnesses? How generous of them. Very well, my wife. Sansa."
17130,"PODRICK: My lord, she's gone."
17131,TYRION: Gone?
17132,PODRICK: No one's seen her since the wedding. You don't think she...
17133,"TYRION: No one had more 'cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa, but the girl is no assassin. Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it. And with my wife's disappearance, it makes me seem that much more guilty. Podrick."
17134,"PODRICK: Yes, my lord?"
17135,TYRION: They'll be following you now.
17136,PODRICK: Who will?
17137,"TYRION: I don't know. They. They. The ominous they. The man pulling the strings. Or woman. My father. Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him. Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle. Whenever something bad happens to me, I assume it's my sister that had a hand in it. But say what you will of Cersei, she loves her children. She is the only one I'm certain had nothing to do with this murder. Which makes it unique as King's Landing murders go."
17138,"PODRICK: Any other witnesses, my lord?"
17139,TYRION: Varys could vouch for me if he dared.
17140,PODRICK: He's already been called as a witness for the queen.
17141,TYRION: Of course. Fetch Bronn. I have a job for him.
17142,"PODRICK: I've already asked, my lord. They won't let him see you."
17143,TYRION: Why not?
17144,PODRICK: They say he's a known cutthroat and your close associate. He's under investigation himself.
17145,TYRION: And my brother? Will they at least allow me to see Jaime?
17146,"PODRICK: I'll ask, my lord."
17147,"NARRATOR:PODRICK stands to go, but hesitates."
17148,"PODRICK: There's something else, my lord. A man, I didn't know his face, he came to ask if I'd testify against you. Said I'd be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges you'd bought a poison called the Strangler."
17149,TYRION: Ser Podrick Payne? Has a nice ring to it. What did you tell him?
17150,"PODRICK: I didn't tell them anything, my lord."
17151,TYRION: Are you going to accept their offer?
17152,PODRICK: My lord.
17153,"TYRION: Testifying against me wasn't a suggestion. If they can't tempt you with honey, they'll choose something less sweet."
17154,"PODRICK: You've been good to me, my lord."
17155,"TYRION: Pod, the trial's in a fortnight. They'll want an answer before that."
17156,"PODRICK: I already gave them an answer, my lord."
17157,"TYRION: I will not have you dying on my behalf. Do you hear me? If I have to take that long walk to the executioner's block, I don't want to see your head already mounted."
17158,PODRICK: My lord.
17159,"TYRION: Pod, I am giving you an order. Go and find my brother. Tell him I need him. And get yourself out of King's Landing before it's too late. Pod! This is farewell."
17160,"PODRICK: Farewell, my lord."

17209,"ALLISER THORN: We just went over this, boy. -Justice can wait."
17210,"JON:  It's not about justice. I told the wildlings we had over 1,000 men at Castle Black alone. Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do. How long do you think they'll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off? Mance has all he needs to crush us, he just doesn't know it yet. As soon as he gets his hands on them, he will. Then he'll throw his full strength at us. And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings, there's still not a thing we can do to stop them."

17370,LITTLEFINGER: Why not?

17376,LITTLEFINGER: You're right. He wasn't involvedi n Joffrey's death. But you were. Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you? I don't suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast.
17377,"SANSA: The poison. I don't understand. The Lannisters gave you wealth, power. Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal."
17378,"LITTLEFINGER: A man with no motive is a man no one suspects. Always keep your foes confused. If they don't know who you are or what you want, they can't know what you plan to do next."
17379,"SANSA: I don't believe you. If they catch you, they'll put your head on a spike just like my father's. You'd risk that just to confuse them?"
17380,LITTLEFINGER: So many men they risk so little. They spend their lives avoiding danger. And then they die. I'd risk everything to get what I want.
17381,SANSA: And what do you want?
17382,"LITTLEFINGER: Everything. My friendship with the Lannisters was productive. But Joffrey, a vicious boy with a crown on his head, is not a reliable ally. And who could trust a friend like that?"
17383,SANSA: Who could trust you?
17384,"LITTLEFINGER: I don't want friends like me. My new friends are predictable. Very reasonable people. As for what happened to Joffrey, well, that was something my new friends wanted very badly. Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong."

17388,"OLENNA: The time has come, my dear. There's nothing more tedious than a trial. Except perhaps these gardens. If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens, I'll fling myself from the cliffs."
17389,MARGAERY: (laughs)
17390,OLENNA: Have you been to see Tommen yet?
17391,MARGAERY: No. Have they even agreed to the match? No one tells me anything.
17392,"OLENNA: I wasn't originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor, you know. He was engaged to my sister, your great-aunt Viola. I was to be given to some Targaryen or other. Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then. But the momentI saw my intended, with his twitchy little ferret's face and ludicrous silver hair, I knew he wouldn't do. So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister, I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber."
17393,MARGAERY: (laughs)
17394,OLENNA:  How absentminded of me.
17395,MARGAERY: Mm-hmm.
17396,"OLENNA: The following morning, Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister 'cause the boy couldn't bloody walk."
17397,MARGAERY: (laughs)
17398,"OLENNA: And once he could, the only thing he wanted was what I'd given him the night before. I was good. I was very, very good. You are even better. But you need to act quickly. Cersei may be vicious, but she's not stupid. She'll turn the boy against you as soon as she can. And by the time you're married, it'll be too late. Luckily for you ,the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment, mourning her dear departed boy. Accusing her brother of his murder, which he didn't commit."
17399,"MARGAERY: Well, he could have done."
17400,"OLENNA: He could have done,but he didn't."
17401,"MARGAERY: You don't know, Grandmother."
17402,"OLENNA: But I do know. You don't think I'd let you marry that beast, do you?"

There's 60 miles of wilderness between here and Craster's and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us, but we have to do this. Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does. They know the Wall. They know our defenses. If Mance learns what they know, we're lost. But if that's not enough, then consider this. If the Night's Watch are truly brothers, then Lord Commander Mormont was our father. He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men.

17693,CERSEI: He would have been your nightmare.
17694,"MARGAERY: Your Grace, I feel..."
17695,"CERSEI: You knew exactly what he was. I did, too. You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child. Doesn't matter what they do. And what he did, it shocked me. Do you think I'm easily shocked?"
17696,MARGAERY: No.
17697,"CERSEI: The things he did shocked me. He's only a boy. A good boy. A decent boy. He always has been. Who was the last decent king, I wonder? He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it."
17698,"MARGAERY:  It would be some consolation, wouldn't it? For all the horror that put him there."
17699,CERSEI: He will need help... if he's going to rule well.
17700,MARGAERY: He has you.

17716,DAARIO: I heard you liked ships.
17717,DAENERYS: How many ships?
17718,"BARRISTAN: 93, Your Grace."
17719,DAENERYS: How many men can they carry?
17720,"BARRISTAN: 9,300, not counting sailors."
17721,DAENERYS: Would that be enough to take King's Landing?
17722,JORAH: The Lannisters have more.
17723,"BARRISTAN: They've been fighting Joffrey's wars for years. They're tired, dispersed. And now their king is dead. 8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning."
17724,"JORAH: It's hard to say. It could be enough. But we're not fighting to make you queen of King's Landing. 10,000 men can't conquer Westeros."
17725,BARRISTAN: The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

17731,DAENERYS:  It appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay isn't going quite as planned.
17732,JORAH: You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind. A boy sits on the Iron Throne. A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it. They've never been more vulnerable.
17733,DAENERYS: You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth. I didn't listen. That all worked out well.
17734,JORAH: (CHUCKLES)
17735,DAENERYS: How can I rule seven kingdoms if I can't control Slaver's Bay? Why should anyone trust me? Why should anyone follow me?
17736,JORAH: You're a Targaryen. You're the Mother of Dragons.
17737,DAENERYS: I need to be more than that. I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains. I will not sail for Westeros.

17745,LITTLEFINGER: You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most? Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.
17746,NARRATOR:SANSA puts up her hood.
17747,SANSA: Is this the only way into the Eyrie?
17748,"LITTLEFINGER: The mountains are impassable. If you want to get to the Eyrie, you need to go through the Bloody Gate. It doesn't matter how large your army is, if you attack this gate, you do it on this road, three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats. The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much, but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them. And the fortress they built here has never been overcome. Not once in 1,000 years. Know your strengths, use them wisely, and one man can be worth 10,000."

17769,"LYSA: Oh, do take down that hood, child. Don't you think know who you are? You think I'd let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was? I let him go so he could bring you here to me."
17770,"NARRATOR:LYSA walks to SANSA, lowers her hood and caresses her face, smiling warmly. They hug."
17771,LYSA: My flesh and blood.
17772,"SANSA: It's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa."
17773,LYSA: You mustn't call me that in front of anyone else.
17774,SANSA: Of course. I understand.
17775,LYSA: No one can know you're here. It would put us in a very precarious position.
17776,SANSA: I would never say a thing.
17777,LYSA: The Lannisters want to destroy us. They've been trying for years. Now they know what it feels like.
17778,ROBIN: Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brother's head.
17779,"SANSA: They did, and my father's."
17780,"ROBIN: They killed my father, too, with poison. I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly, but Mother said I couldn't."

17784,ROBIN: (GIGGLES)
17785,"LYSA: And on top of everything else, they made you marry that filthy troll."
17786,SANSA: They did. They made us both. Lord Tyrion didn't want to.
17787,LYSA: I don't believe that for a moment. Did he force himself on you?
17788,"LYSA: Good. Robin, this is your cousin Sansa. But you're not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself. Do you understand? Sansa, this is my son Robin."

17797,LYSA: Let's get married tonight.
17798,LITTLEFINGER: Ought we not... inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony?
17799,"LYSA: There's only one Lord of the Vale. The others can all hang. Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died, trying to get their claws in me."
17800,LITTLEFINGER: I do think that we could wait until...
17801,"LYSA: I'm done waiting, Petyr. We had our wedding night many years ago. Or don't you remember?"
17802,LITTLEFINGER: Like it was yesterday.
17803,"LYSA: What wife would do for you the things I've done for you? What wife would trust you the way I've trusted you? When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jon's wine, my husband's wine... when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters..."
17804,NARRATOR:LITTLEFINGER kisses LYSA passionately to quiet her. She moans.

17817,TYWIN: When will the wedding take place in your mind?
17818,CERSEI: As soon as decency permits. After we've allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband.
17819,TYWIN:  A fortnight?
17820,CERSEI: That seems reasonable.
17821,"TYWIN: No jugglers, no jousting dwarves, no 77-course meals."
17822,CERSEI: (shakes her head)
17823,TYWIN: And your wedding to Loras?
17824,CERSEI: Shortly after Tommen's.
17825,TYWIN: Shortly?
17826,CERSEI: A fortnight.
17827,TYWIN: I know you don't like them. I didn't like your husband. Used to pat me on the back a lot. I didn't trust him.
17828,CERSEI: We had that in common.
17829,TYWIN: You don't need to make formal alliances with people you trust.
17830,CERSEI: Then whom can we trust?
17831,TYWIN: Ourselves alone.
17832,"NARRATOR:TYWIN rises and pours some wine, handing it to CERSEI. He then pours some for himself."
17833,TYWIN:  The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side.
17834,CERSEI: Robert wasn't particularly rich.
17835,TYWIN: Robert had me funding him. Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.
17836,CESEI: I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one.
17837,TYWIN: Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year?
17838,CERSEI: Haven't a clue.
17839,"TYWIN:  Go on, your best guess."
17840,"CERSEI: Pounds, tons, ounces?"
17841,TYWIN:  Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.
17842,CERSEI: That can't be.
17843,TYWIN: Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.
17844,CERSEI: Then how do we pay for anything?
17845,TYWIN: The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.
17846,CERSEI: How much?
17847,TYWIN: A tremendous amount.
17848,NARRATOR:TYWIN sits.
17849,"CERSEI: There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement."
17850,TYWIN: The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank. There is no someone.
17851,CERSEI: Someone does work there. It is comprised of people.
17852,"TYWIN: And a temple is comprised of stones. One stone crumbles and another takes its place. And the temple holds its form for 1,000 years or more. That's what the Iron Bank is... a temple. We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it. You can't run from them. You can't cheat them. You can't sway them with excuses. If you owe them money and you don't want to crumble yourself, you pay it back. Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect."
17853,"CERSEI: It's for the good of the family, I understand that. I'm not sure my brothers do."
17854,"TYWIN: I know you're building a strong case against Tyrion. And as a mother, that is your right. But as a judge, I cannot discuss the trial with you."
17855,CERSEI: I respect that. We don't need to discuss it.
17856,NARRATOR:She puts her wine down and stands.
17857,CERSEI: The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters. You've started wars to protect this family. Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future. What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire?

17866,"ARYA: If he were here right now, what would you do?"
17867,"HOUND: I'd tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep. Go on, get it over with, your list of doomed men."

17875,SANSA:  Really?
17876,"LYSA:  Oh, yes. At suppertime, she would go straight for honey cakes, candied almonds, custard. Anything sweet. Eventually, your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals. Cat was the firstborn daughter after all. It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat."
17877,SANSA: My mother fat? She never let me have my pudding until I'd finished all my proper food.
17878,"LYSA: This is before she married your father and moved to the North. By the time you were born, your father's austerity had become hers. Marriage changes people. I didn't mean for you to stop. Go on, enjoy them. How do you like them?"
17879,NARRATOR:SANSA eats another. LYSA takes her hand.
17880,SANSA: They're delicious. Where did you get the lemons? You can't grow them up here.
17881,"LYSA: Oh, gods, no. Petyr had three crates brought all the way from King's Landing. He knew you liked lemon cakes. He's so kind. He really cares for you. Think where you'd be without him. In their clutches and tried for murder."
17882,SANSA: Yes. I'm very lucky.
17883,LYSA: He feels responsible for you.
17884,"SANSA: Oh, I know he does. I'm so grateful."
17885,LYSA: Why? Why does he feel responsible for you?
17886,"SANSA: Well, I'm half Tully. He loved your family so much."
17887,LYSA: Loved your mother.
17888,SANSA: No.
17889,LYSA: That's what you wanted to say.
17890,"SANSA: He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you."
17891,"LYSA: Your mother never loved him. Never. Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing. The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon. Your handsome, arrogant, cruel Uncle Brandon. He almost killed Petyr in a duel. And your mother loved him anyway. And now Petyr is risking his life to save you, the daughter of a woman who didn't love him no more than those whores in his brothels. Has he told you about them?"
17892,SANSA: No.
17893,NARRATOR:LYSA holds SANSA's hands firmly and won't let go.

17896,LYSA: Are you pregnant?
17897,"SANSA: What? No, I told you. Lord Tyrion and I never..."

17913,"BRIENNE: Perhaps you should have stayed with him. It's not going to be a pleasant journey for you. It could take weeks to get to the Wall, depending on the weather."
17914,PODRICK: That's a long way off.
17915,"BRIENNE:Well, Lady Sansa's brother's at Castle Black. If I were her, that's where I'd go. Feel free to stop at any point."

17986,OBERYN: You have my word. We don't hurt little girls in Dorne.
17987,"CERSEI: Everywhere in the world, they hurt little girls. Would you bring her a gift for me? I wasn't there for her name day. I don't know when I'll see her again."

18224,"TYCHO: Yes, we have heard this story."
18225,STANNIS: It's not a story. It's the truth.
18226,TYCHO: The king's grandfather tells a different story. A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold.
18227,STANNIS: Gold you loaned him.
18228,TYCHO: And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold?
18229,STANNIS: More than any man living.
18230,"TYCHO: Across the Narrow Sea, your books are filled with words like ""usurper"" and ""madman"" and ""blood right."" Here, our books are filled with numbers. We prefer the stories they tell. More plain. Less open to interpretation. How many fighting men remain loyal to you?"
18231,"STANNIS: 4,000."
18232,"TYCHO: And how many ships do you have? The ones still afloat, Ser Davos, not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay."

18234,"TYCHO: And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4,000 men on your 32 ships?"
18235,STANNIS: None.
18236,TYCHO: You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective. I'm afraid we must respectfully decline your request. But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit.
18237,NARRATOR:STANNIS stands to leave. DAVOS rises as well.
18238,DAVOS: My lord.
18239,"TYCHO: I'm not a lord, Ser Davos Seaworth. You would not be either here. In Braavos, thieves are not rewarded with titles."
18240,"DAVOS: Well, strictly speaking, I didn't do the thieving. That would be the pirates. I just moved what they stole from one place to another.  {DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers."
18241,"DAVOS: This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes. I consider it an honest accounting. He's an honest man and he's your best chance to get back the money you've sunk into Westeros. Which is a lot, I imagine. Wars are expensive."
18242,TYCHO: The war is over.
18243,"DAVOS: As long as Stannis lives, the war is not over. Who's the real power in King's Landing?"

18250,TYCHO: That is a problem for another time.
18251,"DAVOS: Begging your pardon, I think it's a problem for now. There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros. Stannis. He's got the birthright. He's in his prime. He's a tried and tested battle commander. And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it."

18273,DAVOS: You won't be alone. And you won't be poor.
18274,NARRATOR:SALLADOR sighs in resignation.
18275,DAVOS: There's a chest of the good stuff left back at your house. I gave it to your wife.

18389,DAENERYS: Your father crucified innocent children.
18390,"HIZDAHR: My father spoke out against crucifying those children. He decried it as a criminal act, but was overruled. Is it justice to answer one crime with another?"
18391,"DAENERYS: I am sorry you no longer have a father, but my treatment of the masters was no crime. You'd be wise to remember that."
18392,HIZDAHR: What's done is done. You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen. A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated.
18393,DAENERYS: And what traditions do you speak of?
18394,"HIZDAHR: The tradition of funeral rite. Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces. My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts, carrion for vultures, rotting in the sun."

18415,"VARYS: Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, my lord."
18416,CERSEI: A coward and a traitor.
18417,"VARYS: My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers. I believe the phrase ""fuck the king"" was uttered."
18418,PYCELLE: Disgraceful.
18419,TYWIN: What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound?
18420,VARYS: 10 silver stags seems a generous bounty.
18421,TYWIN: Make it 100. What else?
18422,"VARYS: More whispers from the east, my lord."
18423,TYWIN: The Targaryen girl?

18425,CERSEI: Conquered with what?
18426,"CERSEI: Baby dragons. Larger every year, Your Grace."
18427,PYCELLE: Mormont is spying on her for us.
18428,"VARYS: No longer. He appears to be fully devoted to her. As for Ser Barristan, it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated."
18429,CERSEI: He's an old man. He wasn't fit to protect my son.
18430,TYWIN: Joffrey didn't die on his watch. Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid.
18431,CERSEI: Don't tell me you're worried about a child halfway across the world.
18432,"VARYS: A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back, Your Grace."
18433,OBERYN: Lord Varys is right. I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand. They are very impressive on the battlefield. Less so in the bedroom.
18434,TYWIN: Dragons haven't won a war in 300 years. Armies win them all the time. She must be dealt with.
18435,"PYCELLE: How, my lord? By force?"
18436,"TYWIN: Eventually, if it comes to that. Can your little birds find their way into Meereen?"
18437,"VARYS: Most certainly, my Lord Hand."

18441,VARYS: Prince Oberyn.
18442,OBERYN: Lord Varys...
18443,VARYS: Only Varys. I'm not actually a nobleman. No one is under obligation to call me lord.
18444,OBERYN: And yet everyone does.
18445,VARYS: You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied. Did you spend much time in Essos?
18446,OBERYN: Five years.
18447,VARYS: May I ask why?
18448,OBERYN: 'Tis a big and beautiful world. Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it. I don't want to be most of us.
18449,VARYS: Most of us aren't princes.
18450,OBERYN: You are from Essos. Where? Lys?
18451,VARYS: I have an ear for accents. I've lost my accent entirely.
18452,OBERYN: I have an ear for that as well. How did you get here?
18453,VARYS: It's a long story.
18454,OBERYN: One you don't like telling people.
18455,VARYS: People I trust.
18456,"OBERYN: My paramour Ellaria, she would find you very interesting. You should come to the brothel and meet her. We brought our own wine, not the swill they serve here. We have some lovely boys on retainer, but..."
18457,NARRATOR:VARYS doesn't answer.
18458,OBERYN: You did like boys before?
18459,VARYS: (shakes his head)
18460,OBERYN:  Really? Girls? Hmm. I hope you won't be offended when I say I never would have guessed.
18461,"VARYS: Not at all. But I was never interested in girls, either."
18462,OBERYN:  What then?
18463,VARYS:  Nothing.
18464,OBERYN: Everybody is interested in something.
18465,"VARYS: Not me. When I see what desire does to people, what it's done to this country, I am very glad to have no part in it. Besides, the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things."
18466,OBERYN: Such as?
18467,"NARRATOR:VARYS doesn't answer, but looks over to the throne instead. He exits.  OBERYN ponders."

18479,"NARRATOR:TYWIN motions to TOMMEN, who rises in response. Everyone in the hall does as well, including MARGAERY, LORAS and CERSEI."
18480,"TOMMEN: I, Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of my Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, do hereby recuse myself from this trial.

18484,"TYWIN: Did your wife, the Lady Sansa?"
18485,TYRION: Not that I know of.
18486,"TYWIN: How would you say he died, then?"
18487,TYRION: Choked on his pigeon pie.
18488,TYWIN: So you would blame the bakers?
18489,TYRION: Or the pigeons. Just leave me out of it.
18490,TWYIN: The crown may call its first witness.

18492,NARRATOR:MERYN TRANT is on the stand.
18493,"MERYN TRANT: Once we'd got King Joffrey safely away from the mob, the Imp rounded on him. He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool. It wasn't the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey. Right here in this throne room, he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit. Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested he'd meet the same fate. And when I spoke in the king's defense, he threatened to have me killed."
18494,"TYRION: Oh, why don't you tell them what Joffrey was doing?"
18495,TYWIN: Silence.
18496,TYRION: Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her.

18503,"PYCELLE: Had, Prince Oberyn. My stores were plundered."
18504,TYWIN: By whom?
18505,"PYCELLE: By the accused, Tyrion Lannister, after he had me wrongfully imprisoned."
18506,"TYWIN: Grand Maester, you examined King Joffrey's corpse. Was it without question poison that killed him?"
18507,PYCELLE: Without question.
18508,NARRATOR:The crowd murmurs. PYCELLE removes a necklace from his sleeve.
18509,"PYCELLE: This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard, the king's fool. He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark, the wife of the accused, away from the feast. She wore this necklace the day of the wedding. Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside."
18510,TYWIN: Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store?
18511,PYELLE: It was. The Strangler. A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess. And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth.
18512,NARRATOR:The crowd murmurs.

18516,MACE: Your own brother said this to you?
18517,"CERSEI: (Nods.) Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay. I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines. As it turned out, when the attack came, Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements. He believed his presence would inspire the troops."
18518,"OBERYN: Tyrion said, ""And you will know the debt is paid."" What debt?"
18519,CERSEI: I discovered he'd been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand. I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs. He wasn't pleased.
18520,TYRION: (shakes his head)
18521,"TYWIN: Thank you, Your Grace, for the courage of your testimony."

18523,"CUT TO: The throne room, a bit later."
18524,NARRATOR:VARYS is on the stand.
18525,MACE: Do you remember the precise nature of this threat?

18527,MACE: And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council?
18528,VARYS: Yes. After we received word of Robb Stark's death. He didn't seem gladdened by the news. Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause.
18529,NARRATOR:The crowd murmurs.
18530,"TWYIN: You're excused, Lord Varys."
18531,NARRATOR:VARYS nods and leaves the stand.
18532,"TYRION: Father, may I ask the witness one question?"
18533,TYWIN: One.
18534,"TYRION: You once said that without me, this city would have faced certain defeat. You said the histories would never mention me, but you would not forget. Have you forgotten, Lord Varys?"
18535,"VARYS: Sadly, my lord, I never forget a thing."
18536,NARRATOR:VARYS bows and exits. TYRION watches him go.

18543,NARRATOR:INT; Tywin's chambers.
18544,NARRATOR:TYWIN sits eating. JAIME stands.
18545,JAIME: You'd condemn your own son to death?
18546,TYWIN: I've condemned no one. The trial is not over.
18547,JAIME: This isn't a trial. It's a farce. Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it.
18548,TYWIN: I know nothing of the sort.
18549,JAIME:  You've always hated Tyrion.
18550,TYWIN: He killed his king.
18551,JAIME: As did I. Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me? To bring him your head. I saved your life so you could murder my brother?
18552,TYWIN:  It won't be murder. It'll be justice.
18553,JAIME:  Justice?
18554,"TYWIN: I'm performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King. If Tyrion is found guilty, he will be punished accordingly."
18555,JAIME: He'll be executed.
18556,"TYWIN:  No, he'll be punished accordingly."
18557,"JAIME: Once you said family is what lives on. All that lives on. You told me about a dynasty that would last 1,000 years. What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies? I'm a Kingsguard, forbidden by oath to carry on the family line."
18558,TYWIN: I'm well aware of your oath.
18559,JAIME: What happens to your name? Who carries the lion banner into future battles? Your nephews? Lancel Lannister? Others whose names I don't even remember?
18560,TYWIN: What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandson's killer?
18561,JAIME: It survives through me. I'll leave the Kingsguard. I'll take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live.
18562,TYWIN: Done.
18563,NARRATOR:JAIME is speechless.
18564,"TYWIN: When the testimony's concluded and a guilty verdict rendered, Tyrion will be given the chance to speak. He'll plead for mercy. I'll allow him to join the Night's Watch. In three days' time, he'll depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall. You'll remove your white cloak immediately. You will leave King's Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock. You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister. And you'll never turn your back on your family again."

18571,JAIME: You're going to be found guilty.
18572,"TYRION: Oh, you think so?"
18573,"JAIME: When you are, you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall. Father's agreed to it. He'll spare your life and allow you to join the Night's Watch."
18574,TYRIOM: Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out.
18575,NARRATOR:CERSEI enters. She watches her brothers whispering.

18588,SHAE: I swear it.
18589,TYWIN: Do you know this man?
18590,NARRATOR:SHAE looks at TYRION.
18591,SHAE: Yes. Tyrion Lannister.
18592,TYWIN: How do you know him?
18593,SHAE: I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa.
18594,TYWIN: This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey. What do you know of this?
18595,SHAE: I know that he's guilty.
18596,NARRATOR:The crowd gasps.
18597,SHAE: He and Sansa planned it together.

18600,"NARRATOR:TYRION sits, shocked."
18601,"SHAE: She wanted revenge for her father, her mother, her brother. She blamed their deaths on the king. Tyrion was happy to help. He hated Joffrey. He hated the queen. He hated you, my lord."
18602,NARRATOR:The crowd murmurs.
18603,SHAE: He stole poison from the Grand Maester's chamber to put in Joffrey's wine.
18604,OBERYN: How could you possibly know all this? Why would he reveal such plans to his wife's maid?
18605,SHAE: I wasn't just her maid. I was his whore.
18606,NARRATOR:The crowd murmurs.
18607,MACE: I beg your pardon? You said you were his...
18608,SHAE: His whore.
18609,TYWIN: How did you come to be in his service?
18610,"SHAE: He stole me. I was with another man, a knight in your lordship's army. But when Tyrion arrived at the camp, he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent. He broke the knight's arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion. ""You belong to me now,"" he said. ""I want you to fuck me like it's my last night in this world."""
18611,NARRATOR:The crowd laughs.
18612,TYWIN: Silence. Silence!
18613,OBERYN: And did you?
18614,SHAE: Did I what?
18615,OBERYN: Fuck him like it was his last night in this world.
18616,"SHAE: I did everything he wanted. Whatever he told me to do to him. Whatever he felt like doing to me. I kissed him where he wanted. I licked him where he wanted. I let him put himself where he wanted. I was his property. I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored. He ordered me to call him ""my lion,"" so I did. I took his face in my hands and said, ""I am yours and you are mine."""
18617,TYRION: Shae. Please don't.
18618,"SHAE: I am a whore. Remember? That was before he married Sansa. After that, all he wanted was her. But she wouldn't let him into her bed. So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her."
18619,NARRATOR:The crowd clamors.
18620,"TYRION: Father, I wish to confess. I wish... to confess."
18621,NARRATOR:JAIME is shocked.
18622,TYWIN: You wish to confess?
18623,NARRATOR:TYRION turns to the crowd.
18624,TYRION: I saved you. I saved this city and all your worthless lives. I should have let Stannis kill you all.
18625,NARRATOR:The crowd clamors.
18626,TYWIN: Tyrion. Do you wish to confess?
18627,"TYRION: Yes, Father. I'm guilty. Guilty. Is that what you want to hear?"
18628,TYWIN: You admit you poisoned the king?
18629,"TYRION: No, of that I'm innocent. I'm guilty of a far more monstrous crime. I am guilty of being a dwarf."
18630,TYWIN: You are not on trial for being a dwarf.
18631,"TYRION: Oh, yes, I am. I've been on trial for that my entire life."
18632,TYWIN: Have you nothing to say in your defense?
18633,"TYRION: (To Cersei) Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1,000 lying whores."
18634,TYRION: (To the crowd) I wish I was the monster you think I am. I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you. I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it.
18635,TYWIN: Ser Meryn. Ser Meryn. Escort the prisoner back to his cell.
18636,TYRION: I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.

18639,NARRATOR:JAIME and TYRION stand in the jail cell.
18640,JAIME: I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer.
18641,"TYRION: I'm sorry, what am I grateful for? The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit?"
18642,"JAIME: You threw your life away. You threw it away. It's not a joke. You understand that, don't you?"
18643,JAIME: You fell in love with a whore.
18644,"TYRION: Yes, I fell in love with a whore. And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me. That deal you made, it was everything Father wanted. You do see that? He gets you back as his heir. The future Lord of the Rock. And he ships me off to Castle Black, out of sight at last. All so perfect. It felt good to take that from him. He knows I'm innocent and he's willing to sacrifice me anyway. He's willing to sacrifice any of us. Not you. You're the golden son. You could kill a king, lose a hand, fuck your own sister, you'll always be the golden son."
18645,JAIME: Careful. I'm the last friend you've got.
18646,TYRION: At least I got to tell them what they really are.
18647,"JAIME: Yes, brilliant speech. They'll be talking about it for days to come. I thought you were a realist. Didn't realize you'd die for pride."
18648,"TYRION: Don't give up on me just yet. I survived one trial by combat, even though you weren't there to save me."
18649,JAIME: I can't save you this time either. My training has proved that I can't beat a stable boy with my left hand.
18650,"TYRION: Where's your sense of adventure? Even if you lose, imagine the look on Father's face when you fall."
18651,JAIME: (laughs)
18652,TYRION: Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword.
18653,JAIME: It is tempting.
18654,"TYRION: Well... Bronn fought for me once, he'll do it again. If he wins, I expect I'll be in his debt for the rest of my life."
18655,JAIME: If he wins.
18656,TYRION: Will you find him for me? Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion? I hope it's Ser Meryn Trant. I'd enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater.

18737,JON: We need to prepare.
18738,ALLISER: We've been preparing.
18739,JON: We should seal the tunnel. Plug it with rocks and ice. Flood it and let it freeze.

18771,BRONN: I wouldn't say I had a single sort of girl.

18778,TYRION: She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies.
18779,BRONN: She does. Unless she happens to perish before her father. Then Lollys gets the castle.
18780,TYRION: (scoffs.)
18781,BRONN: What? Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time.

18787,TYRION: I'm a bit short on castles at the moment. But I can offer you gold and gratitude.
18788,BRONN: I have gold. What can I buy with gratitude?
18789,TYRION: You might be surprised. A Lannister always pays his debts.
18790,"BRONN: Your sister's a Lannister, too."
18791,"TYRION: My wife is heir to Winterfell. If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders, I may one day rule the North in her name. I could carve you out a big piece of it."
18792,"BRONN: If and may and could. It's bloody cold up north. Lollys is soft and warm. And close. If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain, you'd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink."
18793,TYRION: Does he frighten you so much?
18794,"BRONN: I'd be a bloody fool if he didn't frighten me. He's freakish big and freakish strong. And quicker than you'd expect for a man of that size. Maybe I could take him, dance around until he's so tired of hacking at me, he dropped his sword, get him off his feet somehow. But one misstep... ...and I'm dead. Why should I risk it?"

18824,DAENERYS: I've ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing.
18825,DAARIO: You've ordered us to be night watchmen.

18827,"DAARIO: There is only one, and she does not want me."
18828,DAENERYS: You swore me your sword.
18829,DAARIO: My sword is yours till the day I die.
18830,DAENERYS: So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets?
18831,DAARIO: I'll stay in Meereen and patrol the streets. Send me to kill your enemies. Any enemy anywhere. Let me do what I do best.
18832,DAENERYS: Very well.

18842,"SELYSE: I didn't mean to disturb you, my lady."
18843,MELISANDRE: You could never disturb me.
18844,SELYSE: I just wanted to speak with you before we left.
18845,MELISANDRE: Could you bring me that vial over there? The blue one.
18846,"NARRATOR:SELYSE reaches for a vial, but MELISANDRE stops her."
18847,"MELISANDRE: No, no, no. Not that one. You don't even want to touch that one. Next to it. That's the one."
18848,NARRATOR:SELYSE brings over the vial and MELISANDRE shakes some into the bath. She sighs.
18849,"MELISANDRE: When I looked into the flames this morning, the Lord spoke to me. He said, ""Tonight, you will have your last good bath in a long while. Make it count."" A joke. Not a very good one, I'm afraid."
18850,MELISANDRE: That's because most jokes are lies and you're devoted to the truth.
18851,"SELYSE: If they're lies, my lady, aren't they best avoided?"
18852,MELISANDRE: Not always.
18853,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE leaves the bath and walks to the potions
18854,SELYSE: Did you use it with Stannis?
18855,MELISANDRE: No. Don't be upset. Men never crave what they already have.
18856,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE touches SELYSE on the cheek.
18857,MELISANDRE: It's only flesh. It needs what it needs.
18858,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE puts on her robe.
18859,"SELYSE: No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin. I thank God every day for bringing you to us. And Stannis to you. He wants to bring Shireen with us. I think that would be ill-advised. My daughter has heretical tendencies, as you're well aware. I don't know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me, but whichever the case, she should stay home."
18860,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE takes her hand.
18861,MELISANDRE: I understand how you feel.
18862,SELYSE: Hmm.
18863,MELISANDRE: But that is impossible.
18864,SELYSE: Why?
18865,"MELISANDRE: You don't need powders and potions, my queen. You don't need lies. You are strong enough to look into the Lord's light and see his truth for yourself."
18866,NARRATOR:They look into the fire.
18867,"MELISANDRE: However harsh it is. However hard for us to understand. You don't need my help, but I will need yours soon. When we set sail, your daughter must be with us. The Lord needs her."

18875,DAENERYS: You're here early.
18876,JORAH: Later than some.
18877,DAENERYS: You don't approve?
18878,"JORAH: It's not a question of approval, it's a question of trust."
18879,DAENERYS: You neither approve nor trust.
18880,JORAH: Why would I? The man's a sellsword.
18881,DAENERYS: Didn't you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother?
18882,JORAH: I did.
18883,DAENERYS: I trust you.
18884,JORAH: Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands. How could you ever have faith in a man like that?
18885,DAENERYS: I could never have faith in a man like Daario. That's why I've sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai.
18886,JORAH: You have?
18887,DAENERYS: I have.
18888,"JORAH: Without you there to rule, Khaleesi, I fear the masters will simply bide their time, wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control."
18889,"DAENERYS: That is why I've ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai. The masters tear babies from their mothers' arms. They mutilate little boys by the thousands. They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men. They treat men like beasts, as you said yourself."
18890,"JORAH: Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts. The slaves you freed, brutality is all they've ever known. If you want them to know something else, you'll have to show it to them."
18891,DAENERYS: And repay the slavers with what? Kindness? A fine? A stern warning?
18892,"JORAH: It's tempting to see your enemies as evil, all of them, but there's good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought."
18893,DAENERYS: Let the priests argue over good and evil. Slavery is real. I can end it. I will end it. And I will end those behind it.
18894,"JORAH: I sold men into slavery, Khaleesi."
18895,DAENERYS: And now you are helping me show them to freedom.
18896,JORAH: I wouldn't be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai.
18897,NARRATOR:DAENERYS considers.
18898,DAENERYS: The man who came to me the other day about burying his father.
18899,JORAH: Hizdahr zo Loraq?
18900,DAENERYS: He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai. He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen. He will explain the choice they have before them. They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one.
18901,JORAH: (Nods.)
18902,"DAENERYS:  Well, go and catch Daario before he leaves. Tell him I changed my mind."

18918,NARRATOR:The HOUND sits.
18919,"HOUND: I'm as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village, getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten. No reward is worth this much trouble. Wish I'd never laid eyes on you. You say your brother gave you that sword."
18920,NARRATOR:He points to his face.
18921,HOUND: My brother gave me this. It was just like you said a while back. Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop.
18922,ARYA: Why?
18923,"HOUND: Thought I stole one of his toys. I didn't steal it. I was just playing with it. The pain was bad. The smell was worse. But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it. My father, who protected him... told everyone my bedding caught fire. You think you're on your own?"
18924,ARYA: Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least.
18925,NARRATOR:The HOUND doesn't answer. ARYA stands and walks to him. She pours water on his wound and begins to sew it.

18928,BRIENNE: Bit of comfort never hurt anyone. We've been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks. I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you.
18929,NARRATOR:PODRICK drinks greedily from his cup.
18930,"PODRICK: Couldn't agree more, my lady."
18931,BRIENNE: Just don't start expecting silk underclothes. Not working for your former lord any longer.

18936,HOT PIE: Can I get you anything else?
18937,"BRIENNE: No, this will do nicely, thank you. Kidney pie is wonderful."
18938,HOT PIE: Thanks. I do my best.
18939,NARRATOR:HOT PIE sits.
18940,"HOT PIE: A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients. Flour, lard, water, eggs, milk. Easy enough. But the meat, peacetime or not, getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves' kidneys is not easy. I mean, some people settle for plain old beef kidneys. Got no right to cook anything, them. Oh, and the gravy. Don't get me started on the gravy. Very difficult to get right. See, a lot of people give up on the gravy. You cannot give up on the gravy. No gravy, no pie. Simple as that. That's nice armor. Are you a knight?"
18941,BRIENNE: No.
18942,"HOT PIE: Oh, it's just people with armor are usually knights. Generally speaking. From King's Landing, though, aren't you? From there myself originally. Flea Bottom born and bred. What brings you to these parts?"
18943,BRIENNE: We're looking for someone.
18944,HOT PIE: Someone in particular? Maybe they came in here. A lot of people come in here. Just the other day we had 17--
18945,"BRIENNE: A girl, tall, red hair, very pretty. Her name is Sansa Stark, but she may be using a different name."
18946,"HOT PIE: Starks? What, like them lot from ""Winterhell""?"
18947,NARRATOR:HOT PIE stands and starts to go.

18956,"PODRICK: Don't want to offend, my lady. Truly, I don't."
18957,BRIENNE: You're not interesting enough to be offensive.
18958,PODRICK: The Lannisters want Lady Sansa. The Lannisters have money. People kill for money. I don't think we should be telling people we're searching for Lady Sansa.
18959,NARRATOR:HOT PIE enters.
18960,HOT PIE: My lady. My lord. Could I have a word?
18961,BRIENNE: What about? Not kidney pie.
18962,HOT PIE: You seem like a proper lady. Someone who could be trusted. I never met no Sansa Stark. But I know her sister... Arya.
18963,BRIENNE: No one's seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded. She's presumed dead.
18964,HOT PIE: She weren't when I last spoke to her.
18965,BRIENNE:  When was that?
18966,"HOT PIE: Heading up north with the Night's Watch. She was all dressed up as a boy. Like your ladyship, only without the armor. Going by the name Arry."
18967,BRIENNE:  So what happened to her?
18968,HOT PIE: Well--
18969,BRIENNE: The quick version.
18970,HOT PIE: The Lannisters took us prisoner. We escaped. The Brotherhood took us prisoner. They sold me to the innkeep. They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner. Big ugly fellow. Foul mouth and a face like a half-burnt ham. Not friendly.
18971,PODRICK: The Hound.
18972,"HOT PIE: That's the one. If you find her, could you give her this? She liked the last one I gave her, but, well, this one turned out better."

18979,BRIENNE: Why the Eyrie?
18980,"PODRICK: Her aunt, Lysa Arryn. Catelyn Stark's sister. She's Arya's last living relative with money. She hates the Lannisters. Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who."

18992,OBERYN: Your sister.
18993,TYRION: Oh.
18994,OBERYN:  Cersei approached me. We spoke a great deal about her daughter. How worried your sister is about her. She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you. I think she may have even believed it herself.
18995,TYRION: Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts.
18996,OBERYN: It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions. It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters. She desperately wants to see you killed.
18997,TYRION: She didn't need to bother you. It looks as though I've taken care of that myself. The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck. She's wanted this for a long time.
18998,"OBERYN: Yes, I know. We met, you and I. Many years ago."
18999,TYRION: I think I would have remembered that.
19000,"OBERYN: Unlikely. You had just been born. Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock. My first time away from Dorne. I didn't like anything about the Rock. Not the food, not the weather, your accents. Nothing. But the biggest disappointment... you."
19001,TYRION: You and my family have more in common than you might admit.
19002,"OBERYN: The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister. A head twice the size of his body, a tail between his legs, claws, one red eye, the privates of both a girl and a boy."
19003,TYRION: That would have made things so much easier.
19004,"OBERYN: When we met your sister, she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say, ""Soon."" Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small, but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. ""That's not a monster,"" I told Cersei. ""That's just a baby."" And she said, ""He killed my mother."" And she pinched your little cock so hard, I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. ""It doesn't matter,"" she told us. ""Everyone says he will die soon. I hope they are right. He should not have lived this long."""
19005,"TYRION: Well... sooner or later, Cersei always gets what she wants."
19006,OBERYN: And what about what I want? Justice for my sister and her children.
19007,"TYRION: If you want justice, you've come to the wrong place."
19008,OBERYN: I disagree.
19009,NARRATOR:OBERYN rises.

19017,SANSA: It's a long story.
19018,ROBIN: I stay here in the Eyrie. Mother says it's dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because I'm the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person.
19019,"SANSA: Yes, you certainly are."
19020,ROBIN: When will you go back?
19021,SANSA: Probably never. My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.
19022,ROBIN: Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?
19023,"SANSA: No, I'm afraid not. It's not high up in the mountains. It's down on the ground."

19025,SANSA: We don't.
19026,ROBIN: What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?
19027,SANSA: I never did anything with them at all. Girls didn't take part in that where I came from.
19028,"ROBIN: Well, I'm Lord of the Vale. When I grow up, I'll be able to fly anybody who bothers me. Or you. When we get married, you can tell me if you don't like somebody and then we can bring them back here and, whoosh! Right through the Moon Door."

Like eggs dropped on the floor. Sometimes pieces remain intact. You'll find the head sitting on its own. Every hair in place. Blue eyes staring at nothing. I know what you did."

19093,MAN 2: The Rains of Castamere!
19094,"MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: You fucking dick! Same wrong guess every fucking time. Listen, ya cunt."
19095,NARRATOR:Everyone laughs and goes “ooooo”. She burps the same tune
19096,"MAN 3: Oh, The Bear and the Maiden Fair!"
19097,NARRATOR:Everyone cheers
19098,"MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: There's a man with an ear. Too bad you've got a hangnail for a cock. First time I saw you with your britches down, I thought you were a eunuch! You seen it girls. Like a baby snail peekin' out of his shell. *laughs and walks toward Gilly* *to Gilly* Your baby was crying this morning. It waked me up. You hear me?"
19099,GILLY: Yes.
19100,"MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Well, what are you going to say?"
19101,GILLY: I'm sorry it woke you up.
19102,"MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: I don't care if you're sorry. Keep that baby quiet, or I will."
19103,GILLY: Don't you ever touch him.
19104,"MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: Hehehe, little Wildling bitch. You should've stayed with your own kind. *an owl hoots in the distance* Are you listening to me?"
19105,GILLY: Shut your mouth.
19106,MOLE'S TOWN WHORE: What? It's just an owl you dumb bitch.
19107,GILLY: No it's not.
19108,"NARRATOR:The owl hoots again. A man walks toward a well and in the reflection it's seen that Styr sliced the mans throat. Tormund is also seen as the Wildlings walk through the town killing everyone. Ygritte is also there. Styr and the Wildlings break into the brothel, continuing their killing spree. Ygritte kills everyone upstairs, as she's leaving she hears Gilly's baby cry. Ygritte opens a drape in the back and motions them to keep quiet"
19109,CUT TO: CASTLE BLACK
19110,SAM: I should never have left her there.
19111,JON: You couldn't have known.
19112,SAM: Of course I could've known. They were raiding the villages close by.
19113,GRENN: And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers?
19114,ED: Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black.
19115,"GRENN: Oh, so it's alright then?! Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces 'cause they broke the rules?!"
19116,ED: I didn't say it was alright! I'm sayin' they shouldn't have been there.
19117,GRENN: We pledged to guard the realms of men.
19118,SAM: She's dead because of me.
19119,GRENN: We can't even guard Mole's Town.
19120,"JON: We can't go after them, you know that. That's what they want."
19121,SAM: Little Same. As if I'd cut their throats myself.
19122,"PYP: Maybe she managed to hide herself. I thought one of you was dead, you went North with Mormont and no one came back. Not for ages. But then you did."
19123,ED: She survived Craster and he was the worst shit I've ever met. She survived the long march to the wall. She survived a white walker for fuck's sake. She might've got out.
19124,SAM: She might have.
19125,"JON: If they hit Mole's Town, then we're next. Mance's army must be close."
19126,ED: A hundred thousand.
19127,"GRENN: And there's what, 5 of us left."
19128,"ED: If you're counting Black Jack, Kegs, and Mully. A hundred and two."
19129,PYP: How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand?
19130,"ED: Whoever dies last, be a good lad and burn the rest of us. Once I'm done with this world, I don't want to come back."

19132,CUT TO: MEEREEN
19133,"NARRATOR:Men and women are seen swimming in a lake. They're bathing and washing clothes. Grey Worm looks over at Missandei who is naked. Missandei sees him looking, he looks away ashamed then looks back. She stands up proudly, then covers up. He dunks his head under water"
19134,DANY: You think he was spying on you?
19135,"MISSANDEI: No, not spying."
19136,DANY: The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body. They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see.
19137,MISSANDEI: Yes your grace.
19138,DANY: But you are not Dothraki.
19139,MISSANDEI: No.
19140,"DANY: Well, I don't see why it matters. Grey worm isn't interested, none of the unsullied care what's under our clothes."
19141,MISSANDEI: He was interested.
19142,DANY: What?
19143,MISSANDEI: I believe he was interested.
19144,"DANY: When the slavers castrate the boys, do they take all of it?"
19145,MISSANDEI: All of it?
19146,DANY: The...the pillar an the stones.
19147,"MISSANDEI: I don't know, your grace."
19148,DANY: Haven't you ever wondered?
19149,"MISSANDEI: Yes, your grace."
19150,NARRATOR:Missandei is seen walking up toward Dany's throne. Grey Worm enters
19151,GREY WORM: Missandei. *in Valyrian* I have come to apologize.
19152,MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* You don't need to apologize.
19153,GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* I hope I didn't frighten you.
19154,MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* No.
19155,"GREY WORM: The lessons you give I in Common tongue, these are precious to I."
19156,MISSANDEI: To me.
19157,GREY WORM: To me.
19158,MISSANDEI: I don't remember teaching you the word precious.
19159,"GREY WORM: Jorah the Andal, he teaches I...he teaches me this word."
19160,MISSANDEI: Do you remember the name you were given at birth?
19161,GREY WORM: I remember nothing. Only unsullied.
19162,"MISSANDEI: When they cut you, do you remember that?"
19163,NARRATOR:Grey Worm shakes his head no
19164,MISSANDEI: I'm sorry. I'm sorry they did that to you.
19165,GREY WORM: Why? Why sorry?
19166,MISSANDEI: It's a terrible thing to do to a boy.
19167,"GREY WORM: *approaches Missandei* If the masters never cut me, I am never unsullied. I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters. I never am chosen to lead the unsullied. I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath. I am sorry I...for today. I am sorry."
19168,NARRATOR:Grey Worm turns around and begins to walk away
19169,MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* Grey Worm.
19170,NARRATOR:Grey Worm stops and turns around
19171,MISSANDEI: *in Valyrian* I'm glad you saw me.
19172,GREY WORM: *in Valyrian* So am I.
19173,NARRATOR:Grey Worm turns and walks out of the throne room
19174,CUT TO: MOAT CAILIN
19175,"RAMSAY: Bracken. Mmm, strong. As long as they're in the see. But when you take them out of the water, no bones. They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing. You'd think they'd know that. Unfortunately they're not very bright. What do you tell them?"
19176,"THEON: I'm Theon Greyjoy, son of Balon, heir to the Iron Islands."
19177,RAMSAY: And what are you really?
19178,THEON: I'm Reek.
19179,"RAMSAY: Are you sure? You do look very much like a lord. Formidable, proud."
19180,THEON: I'm Reek.
19181,RAMSAY: Until when?
19182,THEON: Always. Forever.
19183,RAMSAY: That's right. Until you're rotting in the ground. Remember what you are and what you're not. Bring me Lord Kenning.
19184,NARRATOR:Theon approaches the castle on horseback
19185,GUARD 1: *to Theon* No closer. Who are you?
19186,NARRATOR:Theon enters the castle walls. Inside a lot of people are sick or dying
19187,"RALF: I'm Kenning, commander of this garrison. And you say you're Theon Greyjoy?"
19188,THEON: Yes.
19189,RALF: And why should I believe that?
19190,THEON: I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy. His third and last-living son. I am your prince. I swear it by the drowned god. What is dead may never die.
19191,EVERYONE: What is dead may never die.
19192,"RALF: And if you were my prince, why are you marching with a Bolton army?"
19193,THEON: Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell. He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn.
19194,RALF: And what does Lord Bolton want?
19195,NARRATOR:Theon hands Kenning a scroll
19196,THEON: You are fading from sickness. You are badly outnumbered and you're hundreds of miles from the sea. Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold. Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me. The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore.
19197,RALF: He wants us to surrender?
19198,"THEON: My own father, your king, surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon. I watched him bend the knee. There was no shame there. He fought with honor, as did you."
19199,NARRATOR:Kenning falls to the ground. His men pick him up
19200,RALF: ...shame fought with honor.
19201,"THEON: I'm sorry, I didn't hear..."
19202,NARRATOR:Kenning spits blood in Theon's face
19203,RALF: No shame fought with honor. Only a whipped dog would speak this way. Or a woman. Are you a woman boy?
19204,THEON: *scared* You don't know.
19205,RALF: The Ironborn will not surrender.
19206,THEON: *whispering* Reek. Reek.
19207,"RALF: You go tell your master that, Theon Greyjoy. Or whoever the fuck you are. What in the hell are you muttering?"
19208,NARRATOR:MAN 4 kills Kenning with an axe
19209,THEON: Reek.
19210,"MAN 4: If we yield, we live? Is that what it says on this paper here?"
19211,THEON: Yes. Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates. You're going home.
19212,NARRATOR:Cut to MAN 4's body with no skin and his eye cut out
19213,"RAMSAY: You didn't really think I'd let them go did you? It's falling out of fashion. Fileting. Sad, but true. Traditions are important. Where are we without our history, eh?"
19214,THEON: Yes m'lord. Will we go home now?
19215,RAMSAY: I believe we will. To our new home.
19216,CUT TO: THE VALE
19217,"NARRATOR:You have foreign blood, don't you, Baelish?"
19218,"PETYR: A great-grandfather from Braavos, yes. I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally."
19219,LORD ROYCE: Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago. We've fought off invaders ever since.
19220,"PETYR: The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families. Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock, Lord Royce."
19221,"LORD ROYCE: She told me nothing about you, Baelish. But I didn't need to hear from her. Moneylender. Whoremonger. You've been licking Tywin Lannister's boots so long, it's a wonder your tongue's not black."
19222,PETYR: My lord...
19223,"LORD ROYCE: And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin, no one cared. Always been a grubby job. Why not let a grubby man do it? But when I heard you were lurking here, fawning over the Lady Arryn..."
19224,PETYR: Lady Arryn invited me. She and I have been close since childhood.
19225,"LADY ANYA: Yes, we all know how close you were. Lady Arryn's predilections were her own affair. Her death is our affair."
19226,PETYR: Of course. Her suicide shattered us all.
19227,LADY ANYA: She was an odd fish. Everyone knew that. But suicide? She adored that boy of hers. I don't see her abandoning him. Not by choice.
19228,"LORD ROYCE: Strange that within days of your arrival, you've married Lady Arryn and she's fallen through the Moon Door."
19229,PETYR: She was always prone to melancholy. My lady wasn't meant for a world as brutal as ours.
19230,LORD ROYCE: We were told there was a witness. A girl.
19231,"LADY ANYA: A niece of yours, I believe."
19232,"PETYR: A girl with no learning and scattered wits. I assure you, she would be of no help."
19233,LORD ROYCE: We'd like to speak with her.
19234,PETYR: Let me fetch her.
19235,LADY ANYA: No need. We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated.
19236,NARRATOR:Sansa Stark enters the room
19237,"LADY ANYA: Come closer, child. You have nothing to fear from us or him. Lord Baelish here is your uncle? Your name is Alayne? Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room."
19238,PETYR: My lady...
19239,LADY ANYA: I wasn't asking you.
19240,SANSA: He can stay.
19241,"LORD ROYCE: Speak up, girl, you're not a damn kitchen mouse. Tell us what you saw."
19242,"SANSA: *to Petyr* I'm sorry, Lord Baelish. I have to tell the truth. *to the council* I'll tell you everything."
19243,"LADY ANYA: Please, Alayne, leave nothing out."
19244,"SANSA: My name is not Alayne. It's Sansa Stark, eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark. Lord Royce, we met when you came to Winterfell. You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall."
19245,"LORD ROYCE: Sansa Stark? You tell lies right to my face, you little worm?"
19246,"SANSA: Lord Baelish has told many lies. All to protect me. Since my father was executed, I have been a hostage in King's Landing. A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment. They beat me, they humiliated me, they married me to the Imp. I had no friends in King's Landing...except one. He saved me. Smuggled me away when he had the chance. He knew I'd be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood, my Aunt Lysa. The Lannisters have friends everywhere. Even the Vale. He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name."
19247,"SER VANCE: Your secret is safe with us, my lady."
19248,LORD ROYCE: Your father grew up right here in these halls. We hunted together many times. He was a fine man.
19249,"LADY ANYA: Tell us what happened to your aunt, Sansa."
19250,"SANSA: You knew her well, my lords, my lady. You knew she was a troubled woman. She always loved Lord Baelish. She told me herself. From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun, a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack. She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn. She did as her father commanded, as so many of us have. When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish, she was so happy. For a time. My aunt was a jealous lady. She was terrified that Lord Baelish didn't love her anymore. That he would abandon her for a younger woman. And then...one day she saw him kiss me."
19251,LORD ROYCE: Lady Sansa.
19252,"SANSA: It was a peck on the cheek, Lord Royce, nothing more. Lord Baelish is my uncle now, in truth, by marriage. He's always been so kind to me. I was so happy to be here, to be free. All because of him. But my aunt turned on me. She cursed me. Called me a whore. Promised to throw me through the Moon Door. When Lord Baelish tried to calm her, she struck him. She said she didn't want to live anymore. She stood on the edge of that Moon Door. He tried to reason with her. Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved, but she stepped through those doors and she was...*begins sobbing*"
19253,"LADY ANYA: Shh. Shh, it's not your fault, sweet girl. It's not your fault."
19254,NARRATOR:Sansa looks up at Petyr
19255,"NARRATOR:Lord Royce, Lady Anya, and Petyr walk down the stairs"
19256,LORD ROYCE: You could see it in the way she raised that boy. Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old.
19257,LADY ANYA: Lord Royce! This is hardly the time.
19258,"LORD ROYCE: Apologies, my lady. And to you as well, Baelish. We treated you a bit harshly."
19259,"PETYR: You want justice, Lord Royce. I can hardly complain about that. I want the same."
19260,"LADY ANYA: Not much justice to be meted out in suicide, is there?"
19261,"PETYR: For Lysa, no. But for her son? Only 20 years ago, the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, Robert Baratheon. They fought together to overcome the Mad King. And since then, Arryn and Royce, Corbray, Waynwood, all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner. A timid boy at a tavern brawl."
19262,LORD ROYCE: Are you questioning our courage?
19263,"PETYR: I want to know which side you're on. Do you support the Lannisters, the house that executed your friend Ned Stark?"
19264,LORD ROYCE: Of course we don't support the damn Lannisters.
19265,"PETYR: No? Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused. By staying out of the fray, you've allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point. Who stands against him now?"
19266,"LADY ANYA: Who would you have us back, Lord Baelish? Robb Stark is dead."
19267,"PETYR: I'd have you back Robin Arryn, Lord of the Vale."
19268,LADY ANYA: Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy.
19269,PETYR: And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men.
19270,LADY ANYA: More often they die young.
19271,"PETYR: I adored Lysa with all my heart. But she loved her son so much, she became overprotective. He needs to learn how to swing a sword. How to ride a horse."
19272,"LORD ROYCE: Aye, it's time."
19273,"PETYR: Yes, it's time. Time for him to tour the Vale, to visit all the castles in his domain. Time for Robin to leave the nest."
19274,CUT TO: MEEREEN
19275,BOY: Ser Barristan.
19276,SER BARRISTAN: Yes? Who sent you?
19277,NARRATOR:A boy hands a scroll to Ser Barristan. He reads it

19279,SER JORAH: Ser Barristan.
19280,SER BARRISTAN: Ser Jorah.
19281,SER JORAH: Have I forgotten a council meeting?
19282,SER BARRISTAN: No.
19283,NARRATOR:Ser Barristan hands Ser Jorah the scroll
19284,SER JORAH: What's this?
19285,SER BARRISTAN: A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon. You spied on her.
19286,SER JORAH: Who gave you this?
19287,SER BARRISTAN: Does it matter?
19288,SER JORAH: Have you told her?
19289,"SER BARRISTAN: I wanted to tell you first, man-to-man rather than go behind your back."
19290,SER JORAH: Let me speak with her in private.
19291,SER BARRISTAN: You'll never be alone with her again.
19292,NARRATOR:Ser Barristan leaves
19293,"NARRATOR:Ser Jorah enters Dany's throne room, walking toward her"
19294,DANY: Why did the usurper pardon you?
19295,SER JORAH: If we could speak alone.
19296,"DANY: No, speak to me here. Explain it to me."
19297,"SER JORAH: Who do you think sent this to Meereen? Who profits? This is the work of Tywin Lannister. He wants to divide us. If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him."
19298,DANY: The pardon was signed the year we met. Why were you pardoned? Unless you're saying this document was forged.
19299,SER JORAH: It is not forged.
19300,"DANY: Why, then?"
19301,"SER JORAH: I sent letters to Varys, the spymaster of King's Landing."
19302,DANY: What was the content of these letters?
19303,SER JORAH: Information.
19304,DANY: What information?
19305,SER JORAH: When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos. His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo. When you were married. When your brother died.
19306,DANY: You told him I was carrying Drogo's child?
19307,SER JORAH: I...
19308,DANY: Yes or no?
19309,SER JORAH: Khaleesi.
19310,DANY: Don't call me that. Did you tell him I was carrying Drogo's child?
19311,SER JORAH: Yes.
19312,DANY: That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information.
19313,SER JORAH: I stopped you from drinking his wine.
19314,DANY: Because you knew it was poisoned.
19315,SER JORAH: I suspected.
19316,DANY: You betrayed me from the first.
19317,"SER JORAH: Forgive me. I never meant...please, Khaleesi, forgive me."
19318,DANY: You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brother's throne...
19319,SER JORAH: I have protected you. Fought for you. Killed for you.
19320,DANY: ...and you want me to forgive you?
19321,SER JORAH: I have loved you.
19322,"DANY: Love? Love? How can you say that to me? Any other man, and I would have you executed. But you, I do not want you in my city dead or alive. Go back to your masters in King's Landing. Collect your pardon if you can."
19323,"SER JORAH: Daenerys, please."
19324,NARRATOR:Ser Jorah goes for Dany's hand
19325,"DANY: Don't ever presume to touch me again or speak my name. You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city. If you're found in Meereen past break of day, I'll have your head thrown into Slaver's Bay. Go. Now."

19330,LORD BOLTON: Walk with me. Has there been any word from Locke?
19331,RAMSAY: No.
19332,"RAMSAY: Unimportant. A cripple, a young boy. None of the northern lords have seen them. Dead most likely. Most of the Ironborn have fled the North. Now more will follow, thanks to you. Tell me what you see."
19333,"RAMSAY: Moors, fields, hills."
19334,RAMSAY: Tell me what you see.
19335,RAMSAY: Nothing.
19336,"ROOSE: Not nothing. The North. Ride 700 miles that way, you're still in the North. 400 miles that way. 300 miles that way. The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined. And I am the Warden of the North. The North is mine. Now tell me, what is your name?"
19337,RAMSAY: Ramsay Snow.
19338,"ROOSE: No, not Ramsay Snow. *hands Ramsay a scroll* Open it. From this day until your last day, you are Ramsay Bolton, son of Roose Bolton, Warden of the North."
19339,"RAMSAY: You honor me. I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition. I will be worthy of you, Father, I promise."

19344,SANSA: Yes?
19345,"PETYR: First time I saw you, you were just a child. A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time. Not a child any longer. Why did you help me?"
19346,SANSA: They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty.
19347,PETYR: That's not an answer.
19348,"SANSA: If they'd have executed you, what would they have done with me?"
19349,PETYR: I don't know.
19350,SANSA: Neither do I.
19351,PETYR: Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you don't? And you think you know me?
19352,SANSA: I know what you want.

19358,ARYA: Lots of things make me happy.
19359,HOUND: Like what?
19360,"ARYA: Killing Polliver, killing Rorge."
19361,HOUND: So you're sad because you didn't get to kill Joffrey yourself. Is that it?
19362,ARYA: At least I could have been there to watch. I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over.
19363,"HOUND: Aye, nothing in the world beats that look."
19364,ARYA: You protected him for most of his life. You think you could have saved him?
19365,"HOUND: I wasn't the damn wine taster. Little shit deserved to die, but poison...poison's a woman's weapon. Men kill with steel."
19366,ARYA: That's your stupid pride talking. It's why you'll never be a great killer. I'd have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to.
19367,HOUND: *laughs* I'd pay good money to see that. *grunts and rubs his neck*
19368,ARYA: You should have let me burn it.
19369,HOUND: It's a fleabite.
19370,ARYA: That fleabite's got you walking a lot slower than you used to.
19371,"HOUND: Well, we won't have to walk too much further."
19372,ARYA: You really think my aunt will pay for me?
19373,"HOUND: Aye, she'll pay."
19374,ARYA: I've never even met her.
19375,"HOUND: Doesn't matter. You're her blood. Family, honor, all that horseshit. It's all you lords and ladies ever talk about."
19376,ARYA: I'm not a lady.
19377,GUARD: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?
19378,"HOUND: The bloody Hound, Sandor Clegane. And his...traveling companion Arya Stark, niece of your lady Lysa Arryn."
19379,GUARD: Then I offer my condolences. Lady Arryn died. Three days ago.
19380,NARRATOR:Arya bursts out laughing
19381,CUT TO: THE VALE
19382,NARRATOR:Petyr is walking down the stairs with Robin
19383,"ROBIN: I've never left home before, Uncle Petyr. I'm afraid to leave."
19384,PETYR: You shouldn't be.
19385,"ROBIN: The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said. She said it's not safe outside."
19386,PETYR: It wasn't safe for her inside. People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later. Don't worry about your death. Worry about your life. Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts. That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale.
19387,"NARRATOR:Sansa enters the scene and walks down the stairs, Petyr looks at her"
19388,SANSA: Shall we go?
19389,CUT TO: KING'S LANDING
19390,"NARRATOR:In prison, Tyrion drinks wine from Jaime"
19391,TYRION: Wine always helps. I thank you for it. Trial by combat. Deciding a man's guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces. Tells you something about the gods. How much longer?
19392,JAIME: Soon.
19393,"TYRION: Do you think Oberyn has a chance? The Red Viper of Dorne. You don't get a name like that unless you're deadly, right?"
19394,JAIME: I've never seen him fight.
19395,"TYRION: Oh, he's going to die. I'm going to die."
19396,JAIME: Oberyn believes in himself.
19397,TYRION: That's putting it mildly. What's the punishment for regicide? Drawing and quartering? Hanging? Breaking at the wheel?
19398,JAIME: Beheading.
19399,"TYRION: Seems rather ordinary. And he was my nephew as well, so what is that? Fratricide is brothers. Filicide is sons. Nepoticide. That's the one. Matricide, patricide, infanticide, suicide. There's no kind of killing that doesn't have its own word."
19400,JAIME: Cousins.
19401,"TYRION: Cousins, you're right. There is no word for cousin killing. Well done. Do you remember cousin Orson? Orson Lannister?"
19402,JAIME: Of course. Wet-nurse dropped him on his head. Left him simple.
19403,TYRION: Simple? Used to sit all day in the garden. Crushing beetles with a rock.
19404,TOGETHER: Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!
19405,TYRION: Nothing made him happier.
19406,JAIME: Nothing made you happier. You'd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted.
19407,TYRION: On the contrary. Laughing at another person's misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else.
19408,"JAIME: The joke wore thin, though."
19409,TYRION: For you. You drifted away.
19410,JAIME: I had other interests.
19411,"TYRION: Yes, other interests. But I stayed with Orson."
19412,JAIME: Why?
19413,"TYRION: I was curious. Why was he smashing all those beetles? What did he get out of it? First thing I did was ask him. ""Orson, why are you smashing all those beetles?"" He gave me an answer. ""Smash the beetles. Smash 'em. Khuu! Khuu! Khuu!"" I wasn't deterred. I was the smartest person I knew. Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron. So I went to Maester Volarik's library."
19414,JAIME: Volarik. Tried to touch me once.
19415,"TYRION: Turns out, far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons. Doesn't seem right. In any case, I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orson's affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter. So I went back to the source. I may not have been able to speak with Orson, but I could observe him, watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior. *picks up a beetle* And as I watched, I became more and more sure of it. There was something happening there. His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didn't understand. But he wasn't mindless. He had his reasons. And I became possessed with knowing what they were. I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him. I would eat my lunch in the garden, chewing my mutton to the music of ""khuu, khuu, khuu"". And when I wasn't watching him, I was thinking about him. Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orson's beetles. I read the histories of Targaryen conquests. Did I hear dragon wings? No. I heard ""khuu, khuu, khuu"" and I still couldn't figure out why he was doing it. And I had to know, because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason."
19416,"JAIME: Every day around the world, men, women, and children are murdered by the score. Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles?"
19417,"TYRION: I know, I know. But still, it filled me with dread. Piles and piles of them, years and years of them. How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt? In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see. I woke up crying, weeping for their shattered little bodies. I tried to stop Orson once."
19418,JAIME: He was twice your size.
19419,"TYRION: He just pushed me aside with a ""khuu"" and kept on smashing. Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him. *puts the beetle back on the ground* So what do you think? Why did he do it? What was it all about?"
19420,JAIME: I don't know.
19421,NARRATOR:Bells begin chiming in the distance. Jaime goes to leave
19422,JAIME: Good luck today.
19423,"NARRATOR:Tyrion walks out toward the arena. The Lannisters are there, Oberyn is there getting ready for the battle. Tyrion passes him in handcuffs"
19424,TYRION: Looks like very light armor.
19425,OBERYN: I like to move around.
19426,TYRION: You could at least wear a helmet. You shouldn't drink before a fight.
19427,OBERYN: You learn this during your years in the fighting pits? I always drink before a fight.
19428,TYRION: It could get you killed. It could get me killed.
19429,OBERYN: Today is not the day I die.
19430,ELLARIA: You're going to fight that?
19431,OBERYN: I'm going to kill that.
19432,ELLARIA: He is the biggest man I've ever seen.
19433,OBERYN: Size does not matter when you are flat on your back.
19434,TYRION: Thank the gods.
19435,"PYCELL: In the sight of gods and men, we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this...man Tyrion Lannister. May the Mother grant them mercy. May the Father give them such justice as they deserve. And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion..."
19436,NARRATOR:Tywin speeds the process along in boredom. Horns sound to start the fight. Oberyn kisses Ellaria
19437,ELLARIA: Don't leave me alone in this world.
19438,OBERYN: Never.
19439,NARRATOR:Oberyn is tossed his weapon. He's very good with it. The crowd cheers
19440,OBERYN: Have they told you who I am?
19441,MOUNTAIN: Some dead man.
19442,NARRATOR:The Mountain lunges forward as the battle begins
19443,OBERYN: I am the brother of Elia Martell. Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shit-pile of a city? For you.
19444,OBERYN: I'm going to hear you confess before you die. You raped my sister. You murdered her. You killed her children. Say it now and we can make this quick.
19445,OBERYN: Say it. You raped her. You murdered her. You killed her children.
19446,OBERYN: You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children!
19447,NARRATOR:Oberyn stabs the Mountain in the gut
19448,OBERYN: You raped her! You murdered her!
19449,NARRATOR:Oberyn charges at the Mountain to give him one final blow
19450,OBERYN: You killed her children!
19451,"NARRATOR:Everyone looks down, surprised. Oberyn pulls his weapon out of the Mountain and starts walking around his body"
19452,"OBERYN: Wait. Are you dying? No, no, no. You can't die yet. You haven't confessed. Say it. Say her name. Elia Martell. You raped her. You killed her children. Elia Martell. Who gave you the order? Who gave you the order?! Say her name! You raped her! You murdered her! You killed her children. Say it. Say her name. Say it!"
19453,"NARRATOR:The Mountain trips Oberyn and grabs him in his massive hands. He punches out his teeth and gets on top of Oberyn, squeezing his head"
19454,MOUNTAIN: Elia Martell. I killed her children. Then I raped her. Then I smashed her head in like this!
19455,NARRATOR:Ellaria screams in agony. Tyrion looks dead inside
19456,"TYWEN: *standing up* The gods have made their will known. Tyrion Lannister, in the name of King Tommen of the House Baratheon, First of His Name, you are hereby sentenced to death."
19457,NARRATOR:Opens on Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly standing on the edge of The Wall. It's night
19458,SAM: What was she like?
19459,JON: She...she had red hair.
19460,SAM: Oh? How big were her feet?
19461,JON: Well what do you want me to say?
19462,SAM: I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone. To be with someone. To love someone and have them love you back. We're all gonna die a lot sooner than I'd planned. You're the closest I'll ever get to know it.
19463,JON: So you and Gilly never-
19464,SAM: No...she just had a baby! ...and she never offered.
19465,"JON: But if she had, you would've? You'd have broken your vows?"
19466,"SAM: The interesting thing is, our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women."
19467,JON: What?
19468,"SAM: ""I shall take no wife"" yes, that's in there, there's no denying that. ""I shall father no children"" it's very specific. But what our vows have to say about other...activities...is open to interpretation."
19469,JON: I don't think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation.
19470,"SAM: Anyway, there's nothing for him to interpret. We didn't. So what's it like?"
19471,"JON: It's...there's this person, this whole other person. And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you and...you...for a little...for a little while you're more than just you, you're...well I don't know, I'm not a bleedin' poet!"
19472,"SAM: No, you're really not."
19473,JON: And what did I get for it? An arrow six inches from my heart.
19474,SAM: There'll be arrows for all of us soon I imagine.
19475,JON: There will.
19476,SAM: They've already done the worst thing to me they could ever do.
19477,"JON: Go get some sleep, Sam. I'll take this watch."
19478,"NARRATOR:Sam gets in the lift back down off the wall. An owl perches on a post. Cut to the Wildlings where Thenn warg is standing with his eyes white. Ygritte, Tormund, and Styr are sitting in the background"
19479,TORMUND: Did I ever tell you about her? My Sheila?
19480,YGRITTE: Yes.
19481,"TORMUND: Oh that was a night to remember. Of course, I'd had a good bit to drink *laughs* the fangs were sharp, but she knew how to use them. And she was nice and soft down below. No, she was no ordinary beast. Many's the man who--"
19482,YGRITTE: I know you never fucked a bear. You know you never fucked a bear. Right now I don't wanna think about the bear you never fucked. Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crow's heart.
19483,TORMUND: We could be waiting here a while.
19484,"YGRITTE: Good. The longer we wait, the more arrows I'll have. When they came up here, to our land, and put up a big wall and said it was their's. Then they started hunting us down. But this time, we're the one's doing the hunting."
19485,STYR: You've got a lot to say about killing. Even more words than arrows.
19486,"YGRITTE: Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did. More, I reckon."
19487,STYR: Yes. But none of those were your Crow lover.
19488,YGRITTE: I probably killed him already.
19489,STYR: So you've said.
19490,YGRITTE: And if not. The only thing left of him is gonna be his fun-bits hanging around me neck.
19491,STYR: And more words. Know what I think you do when you see him? Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge.
19492,NARRATOR:Everyone laughs. Ygritte gets up and rushes towards Styr
19493,"YGRITTE: What, you been thinkin' about that ginger minge? Wondering what it tastes like?"
19494,STYR: Maybe I have.
19495,"YGRITTE: Jon Snow is mine. *shouting* Anyone else tries to kill him, I'll have an arrow for them. *to Styr* And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me."
19496,"NARRATOR:Gilly walks along the top of the hill with her baby, looking down at the Wildling camp. She walks away quickly. Cut to Sam in the library reading"
19497,"AEMON: And what is it that couldn't wait until morning, Tarly?"
19498,SAM: Maester Aemon. How did you know-
19499,AEMON: That it was you? Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night?
19500,SAM: Let me help you.
19501,"AEMON: Oh, no need. I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black. Thousands of books and no eyes to read them. Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else. But you didn't answer my question, what are you reading?"
19502,SAM: Maester Faull
19503,"AEMON: Ah, the Wildlings. I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library."
19504,SAM: But what he says about what they do...it's all true. It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.
19505,AEMON: Yes. Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us! Love is the death of duty. I told that to your friend Jon Snow once. He didn't listen and neither did you. That's why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love.
19506,SAM: I don't love her.
19507,AEMON: Yes you do.
19508,SAM: No.
19509,AEMON: Yes you do! I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me. I remember how it sounds! I was in love once.
19510,SAM: You were?
19511,"AEMON: You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child, is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?"
19512,"SAM: I'm sorry Maester, I didn't mean it like that."
19513,AEMON: You know who I was before I came here? What I could've been if I'd only said the word? Of course you do. I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen. A future king always does. Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections. One of them succeeded. I was very young.
19514,SAM: Who was she?
19515,AEMON: Ah ha. I could tell you everything about her. Who she was. How we met. The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose. I can see her right in front of me. She's more real than you are. We could spend all night trading tales of lost love. Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death. Go to bed Tarly.
19516,NARRATOR:Aemon gets up and blows out the candle. Sam leaves the room and outside hears Gilly at the gate talking with Pypar
19517,"PYP: I'm sorry, I can't open the gate for nobody. It's orders!"
19518,"GILLY: They killed everyone! Everyone but me and my baby. And they're out there. I saw them on the way here, they may have seen me, they may have followed me please!"
19519,"PYP: I'm sorry, I can't."
19520,"GILLY: If they find the boy, you don't know what they'll do."
19521,SAM: Pyp! Open the gate.
19522,PYP: I can't.
19523,"GILLY: Sam, is that you?!"
19524,SAM: Yes!
19525,PYP: Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate.
19526,"SAM: Oh, Pyp. Open the fucking gate!"
19527,NARRATOR:Pyp goes to open the gate
19528,PYP: I've never heard you curse before.
19529,"SAM: Yes, well, best get used to it."
19530,NARRATOR:Gilly runs inside and Sam embraces her
19531,"SAM: Are you alright? Shh, you're alright. Yeah, of course you are my brave little fella."
19532,GILLY: It was horrible.
19533,SAM: I'm so so sorry. I didn't know until I got back.
19534,"GILLY: Don't let them send me away, Sam."
19535,SAM: Never.
19536,GILLY: I know there's no women allowed.
19537,"SAM: Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me. From now on, wherever you go, I go too."
19538,NARRATOR:A horn sounds in the distance
19539,ALLISER: Get ready!
19540,NARRATOR:Members of the Night's Watch can be heard shouting frantically. The owl screeches. Cut to Thenn warg whose eyes turn back to normal
19541,THENN WARG: It's time.
19542,NARRATOR:The Wildlings get up and look at the hill. The owl flies away as the Night's Watch prepare for battle. Jon Snow walks out to the edge of The Wall and looks down upon flames in the distance. The Night's Watch light torches preparing for battle. Barrels are rolled to the edge of The Wall
19543,JANOS: Pick up the pace!
19544,NARRATOR:The barrels are rolled into place
19545,"JON: There we go, boys. That's one. There's two. Come on, let's get the next lot. That's the last of the oil, Ser Alliser."
19546,ALLISER: A hundred thousand you say?
19547,JON: Yes sir.
19548,ALLISER: You can say it if you like. We should've sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested.
19549,"JON: It was a difficult decision either way, Ser."
19550,"ALLISER: Do you know what leadership means, Lord Snow? It means that the person in charge gets second-guessed by every clever little twat with a mouth. But if he starts second-guessing himself, that's the end. For him. For the clever little twats. For everyone. This is not the end. Not for us. Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back. And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job."
19551,NARRATOR:Sam and Gilly are walking down a hall. Sam unlocks a door and they both enter. The room is filled with supplies. Gilly lays her baby on a sack of something
19552,SAM: You'll be safe down here. I'll check on you as soon as I can.
19553,GILLY: You're leaving me again?
19554,SAM: I'm not leaving you!
19555,GILLY: You're going up there and we're staying down here. That's leaving. You said from now on we'd stay together.
19556,SAM: I...I didn't mean in the same room.
19557,GILLY: What are you going to do out there?
19558,SAM: Help my brothers.
19559,GILLY: How?! You going to fight the Free Folk when they come? They'll kill you. In Molestown they killed everyone.
19560,SAM: I can't just hide here with you while they're fighting out there.
19561,"GILLY: Why not? You won't matter up there, you will down here."
19562,"SAM: Look. I am a man of the Night's Watch, Gilly. I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it, because that's what men do."
19563,NARRATOR:Sam kisses Gilly
19564,GILLY: Promise me you won't die.
19565,SAM: I promise you I won't die.
19566,"NARRATOR:Sam turns around and leaves the room. Outside the Night's Watch is still getting ready for battle. Pyp sets some arrows up then stands back, scared"
19567,SAM: There's a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side. We've got us some weapons and things. This is the perfect place for us to be.
19568,PYP: I've never thrown a spear before. I've never held a sword with a proper edge. There's no place for me to be. You're not afraid?
19569,"SAM: Of course I'm afraid, there's a band of Wildlings coming to kill us."
19570,"PYP: Well if you're afraid of a band of Wildlings, how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker?"
19571,"SAM: I didn't know I was going to kill it, but I had to do something I didn't have any choice, he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby. If someone had asked me my name right then, I wouldn't have known. I wasn't Samwell Tarly anymore. I wasn't a Steward in the Night's Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that. I was nothing at all. And when you're nothing at all, there's no more reason to be afraid."
19572,PYP: But you're afraid now?
19573,"SAM: Yes, well, I'm not nothing anymore."
19574,NARRATOR:Ygritte looks up at Castle Black. She sees Sam in the tower and she runs down the hill toward the other Wildlings
19575,YGRITTE: Most of their men are up top. Didn't count more than twenty down there. Leftovers. They've got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front.
19576,STYR: How high are the walls?
19577,"YGRITTE: Well, we'll be up and over before they know what's happened."
19578,TORMUND: Let's kill some Crows!
19579,NARRATOR:Everyone cheers
19580,TORMUND: *yells* Come on! *puts out the fire*
19581,"NARRATOR:The Wildlings head towards Castle Black. Overhead shot pans to show the castle, The Wall, and then the flames in the distance. Mance Rayder's forces are seen stomping and yelling through the woods. A giant rides a giant mammoth. The Night's Watch perched upon the wall look down at them in awe"
19582,"ALLISER: Archers knock, everyone else hold."
19583,"NARRATOR:The archers get ready to shoot, Grenn accidentally drops a barrel"
19584,ALLISER: I said knock and hold you cunts! Does knock mean draw?!
19585,NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!
19586,ALLISER: Does fucking hold mean fucking drop?!
19587,NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!
19588,ALLISER: You all plan to die here tonight?
19589,NIGHT'S WATCH: No Ser!
19590,ALLISER: That's very good to hear. Draw!
19591,"MEMBER 1: Help, down below."
19592,NARRATOR:Tormund and his men rush Castle Black as archers shoot at them. Ygritte grabs flaming arrows from the ground and shots up at the Night's Watch
19593,JANOS: They're attacking the southern gates!
19594,ALLISER: Now?
19595,JANOS: Now!
19596,"ALLISER: I'm going down then. Brother Slynt, you have The Wall."
19597,JANOS: What?!
19598,"ALLISER: What are you fucking waiting for, loose!"
19599,JANOS: You heard the man. Loose!
19600,"NARRATOR:The archers on The Wall let loose a barrage of arrows downward at Rayder's troops. They back up, then cheer. On the other side, Ygritte continues to let loose flaming arrows"
19601,"TORMUND: You, over there."
19602,NARRATOR:Pyp shoots a crossbow down at Tormund's troops
19603,SAM: Did you get one?
19604,"PYP: No. Ah shit, Pyp. Shit. Sam."
19605,SAM: Yeah?
19606,PYP: I think we're gonna die.
19607,SAM: If you keep missing we will.
19608,NARRATOR:Tormund's troops throw rope up at the gate. Alliser steps off the lift and walks towards the Night's Watch
19609,ALLISER: Brothers! A hundred generations have defended this castle. We've never fallen before. She will not fall tongiht. Those are Things at our walls. They eat the flesh of the men they kill. Do you want to fill the belly of a Thing tonight?
19610,NIGHT'S WATCH: No!
19611,"ALLISER: Tonight we fight. And when the sun rises I promise you, Castle Black will stand."
19612,NARRATOR:Night's Watch cheers
19613,ALLISER: The Night's Watch will stand.

19621,JANOS: No such thing as giants. They're stories for the children.
19622,"GRENN: Brother Slynt! I've just got word that Ser Alliser needs you below. You're the most experienced man he's got, he said he needs ya."

19719,"JON: Great victory? Mance was testing our defenses. He almost made it through. And he has more giants, he has more mammoths. He has a thousand times as many men. They'll hit us again tonight. Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two, but we can never beat them."
19720,SAM: Where are you going?
19721,JON: I'm going to find Mance.
19722,SAM: To...you can't do that. No one gave you any orders.
19723,"JON: Who's left to give orders? The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance. He united a hundred warring tribes. Without Mance they lose their leader. They lose their purpose, they go back to fighting each other, scatter back to their home."
19724,SAM: Without Mance? You're going to kill him?
19725,JON: I'm going to try.
19726,"SAM: They'll never let you within a hundred yards of him. And if you did, even if you managed to kill him."
19727,JON: He'll kill me. If I don't go he'll kill me anyway. They'll kill the rest of us too.
19728,SAM: He won't just kill ya. They'll boil you. They'll filet you. They'll make it last days!

19732,NARRATOR:Sam waves his torch to signal the raising of the gate. Jon removes his sword
19733,SAM: What are you doing?

19790,"CERSEI: They had nothing to do with it. The man who murdered our father, he tore us apart, he’s the enemy. I’ve been telling you for years, you’ve been defending him for years…"

19900,"STANNIS: If they swear to follow me, I’ll pardon them. We’ll take Winterfell. Once the North is won, I’ll declare them citizens of the realm. I’ll give them land to live on."
19901,DAVOS: It’s a fair offer. More than fair.
19902,STANNIS: I’ll offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty.
19903,JON: I don’t think that’s likely.
19904,"STANNIS: You admire him, don’t you?"
19905,JON: I respect him.
19906,STANNIS: He likes you. Convince him to bend the knee...
19907,JON: Your grace…
19908,STANNIS: ...or he burns.
19909,JON: How much time do I have?
19910,"STANNIS: Nightfall. The sun drops fast this time of year. Hurry, Jon Snow."
19911,CUT TO: THE VALE OF ARRYN
19912,"NARRATOR:Sansa, Littlefinger, and Yohn Royce are watching Robin parry. He is being beaten badly."
19913,"MASTER OF ARMS: Sword up! Attack, my lord! Attack! Don’t cross your feet!"
19914,YOHN ROYCE: My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk. This one…
19915,BAELISH: Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior.
19916,ROYCE: Great warrior? He sings a sword like a girl with palsy.
19917,SQUIRE: My lord. (hands Baelish a note)
19918,"MASTER OF ARMS (O.S.): Sword up, my lord!"
19919,BAELISH: Some boys develop more slowly. He’s still young.
19920,ROYCE: He’s 13. Boys go to war at 13.
19921,BAELISH: He has other gifts.
19922,ROYCE: Does he?
19923,BAELISH: The gift of a great name. Sometimes that’s all one needs.
19924,NARRATOR:He offers his hand to Sansa and takes her away from the swordfight. Lord Royce follows.
19925,"SANSA: Goodbye Lord Royce, and thank you for all you’ve done for me."
19926,"ROYCE: I have done nothing more than my duty, my lady."
19927,"BAELISH: I have no doubt that upon my return, Robin’s skills will have improved immeasurably."
19928,"ROYCE: He’ll be safe here. As for his skills, I make no promises."
19929,CUT TO: COUNTRYSIDE
19930,"NARRATOR:Podrick sits down next to Brienne, who is sharpening her sword."
19931,"PODRICK: Will we head north at some point? He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black. We’re a few days ride from the Kingsroad, but that will take us--"
19932,BRIENNE: Us? The only reason you’re here is that Jaime Lannister told me you weren’t safe in the capital. You’re hundreds of miles from King’s Landing. No one knows what you look like. No one cares. You’re safe.
19933,PODRICK: But I’m you’re squire.
19934,BRIENNE: Do you even know what a squire is?
19935,PODRICK: An attendant to a knight?
19936,BRIENNE: I’m not a knight. That means you’re not a squire.
19937,"PODRICK: Well, where would I go?"
19938,"BRIENNE: I don’t care, I’m not your mother."
19939,PODRICK: You swore to find the Stark girls.
19940,BRIENNE: I found Arya. She didn’t want my protection.
19941,PODRICK: Sansa still might.
19942,BRIENNE: Will you shut your mouth? I didn’t ask for advice. I don’t want anyone following me. I’m not a leader. All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in. The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.
19943,NARRATOR:A horse and carriage rides by.
19944,NARRATOR:INT. CARRIAGE
19945,SANSA: You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.
19946,BAELISH: I did.
19947,SANSA: But we’re heading west.
19948,BAELISH: We are.
19949,"SANSA: If he wanted to betray us, he already would have."
19950,"BAELISH: Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is, but he’s not alone in that castle. Do you trust all those knights and ladies, stable boys and serving girls?"
19951,SANSA: No. Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us?
19952,NARRATOR:Baelish smiles.
19953,"BAELISH: No. But I pay them well, and they’ve seen what happens to men who disappoint me."
19954,SANSA: So where are we going? To a land where you trust everyone?
19955,"BAELISH: So a land so far from here, even Cersei Lannister can’t get her hands on you."
19956,CUT TO: KING’S LANDING
19957,NARRATOR:Close-up on Cersei drinking wine while Loras talks in the background.
19958,"LORAS: It was such a deep, deep shock to us all. Your father was a force to be reckoned with. He truly was. I wouldn’t presume to claim to have known him as such…"
19959,NARRATOR:Cut to Tommen talking and smiling with Margaery.
19960,LORAS: But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with. What a… what a force to be reckoned with.
19961,CERSEI (sighs): Thank you so much for your kind words.
19962,NARRATOR:Cersei walks away and heads down the stairs.
19963,"GRAND MAESTER PYRCELLE: Deepest condolences, your grace. This tragedy… I never trusted Varys. I often warned…"
19964,NARRATOR:Cersei walks away from him. A barefooted man in a robe walks up to Cersei.
19965,LANCEL LANNISTER: Your grace.
19966,NARRATOR:Cersei inspects him for a moment.
19967,CERSEI: Cousin Lancel. I hardly recognized you.
19968,LANCEL: My deepest sympathies.
19969,KEVAN LANNISTER: I apologize for my son’s appearance.
19970,"CERSEI: Uncle, it’s quite alright."
19971,NARRATOR:Lancel walks away.
19972,"KEVAN: They call themselves sparrows. Bloody fanatics. Religion has its place, of course, but at a certain point… They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive."
19973,CERSEI: I’m sure he’ll grow out of it. Whatever it is. Excuse me.
19974,KEVAN: Of course.
19975,"NARRATOR:Cersei walks away, grabs a glass of wine, and heads to a room alone. Lancel greets her after some time."
19976,CERSEI: Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed.
19977,LANCEL: It wasn’t my wounds that needed healing.
19978,CERSEI: What can I do for you?
19979,LANCEL: You can forgive me.
19980,CERSEI: What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness?
19981,LANCEL: I led you into the darkness.
19982,CERSEI: I doubt you’ve ever led anyone anywhere.
19983,"LANCEL: I tempted you into our unnatural relations. And, of course, there was the king. His boar hunt. His wine."
19984,CERSEI: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
19985,"LANCEL: I’m a different person now. I found peace in the light of the Seven. You can too. They watch over all of us, ready to dole out mercy… or justice. Their world is at hand. I will pray for your father’s soul."
19986,NARRATOR:Cersei laughs.
19987,CERSEI: The day Tywin Lannister’s soul needs your help…
19988,NARRATOR:Cersei takes a sip of wine and Lancel walks away.
19989,CUT TO: LORAS’ BEDROOM
19990,NARRATOR:Close-up of Loras' birth mark.
19991,OLYVAR: It looks like Dorne.
19992,LORAS: No it doesn’t.
19993,OLYVAR: It does. That’s the Sunspear bit right there. And that’s where the mountains are. And over here is… Sunsnake? Stonespear?
19994,LORAS: Sandstone.
19995,"OLYVAR: Yes. Yes, Sandstone. Just there."
19996,LORAS: Fine.
19997,NARRATOR:They start kissing.
19998,LORAS: It’s Dorne.
19999,OLYVAR: We should go there. I think we would have a lovely time.
20000,"LORAS: Judging by my experience, that would be wonderful. Dorne, Highgarden. Anywhere but here."
20001,NARRATOR:They kiss. Margaery walks in.
20002,MARGAERY: We’re late for dinner as it is.
20003,LORAS: You’re very respectful.
20004,MARGAERY: I’m very hungry.
20005,NARRATOR:She closes the door.
20006,MARGAERY: What’s your name?
20007,"OLYVAR: Olyvar, my lady."
20008,"MARGAERY: I’m afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting, Olyvar."
20009,NARRATOR:Olyvar kisses Loras then leaves the room.
20010,MARGAERY: Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet?
20011,LORAS: Why? They all know about me anyway. Everybody knows everything about everyone. What’s the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this?
20012,MARGAERY: In any event… (throws Loras his clothes) you shouldn’t keep your intended waiting.
20013,LORAS: My intended? Please. Tywin’s dead. That means no one can force Cersei to marry me.
20014,MARGAERY: Lucky you.
20015,LORAS: Unlucky you.
20016,MARGAERY: You think I want that woman married to my brother?
20017,"LORAS: If she doesn’t marry me, she doesn’t go to Highgarden. Which means she stays in King’s Landing. Which means you’re trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your mother-by-law."
20018,MARGAERY: Perhaps.
20019,LORAS: Perhaps?
20020,MARGAERY: Perhaps?
20021,CUT TO: PENTOS
20022,NARRATOR:Tyrion is standing on a balcony with a glass of wine. Varys approaches him.
20023,"TYRION: Eunuch, the spider, the master of whisperers."
20024,"VARYS: Imp, half-man."
20025,NARRATOR:Tyrion raises his glass.
20026,VARYS: There are faster ways to kill yourself.
20027,TYRION: Not for a coward.
20028,"VARYS: You are many things, my friend, but not a coward."
20029,TYRION: You never told me why you set me free.
20030,VARYS: Your brother asked me to.
20031,TYRION: You could have said no.
20032,VARYS: Refuse the Kingslayer? A dangerous proposition.
20033,"TYRION: Not as dangerous as releasing me. You risked your life, your position, everything. Why? You’re not family, you owe me nothing."
20034,VARYS: I didn’t do it for you. I did it for the Seven Kingdoms.
20035,TYRION: A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms.
20036,VARYS: I don’t believe in saviors. I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come.
20037,TYRION: You’re going to have to find another soldier. I’m done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me.
20038,"VARYS: You have many admirable qualities, self-pity is not one of them. Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power. But earning it for yourself, that takes work."
20039,TYRION: I’m not well-suited for work.
20040,"VARYS: I think you are. You have your father’s instinct for politics, and you have compassion."
20041,TYRION: Compassion? Yes. I killed my lover with my bare hands. I shot my own father with a crossbow.
20042,VARYS: I never said you were perfect.
20043,TYRION: What is it you want exactly?
20044,VARYS: Peace. Prosperity. A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless.
20045,"TYRION: Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine. The powerful have always preyed on the powerless, that’s how they became powerful in the first place."
20046,"VARYS: Perhaps. And perhaps we’ve grown so used to horror we assume there’s no other way. If you sat on the Iron Throne, would you spread misery throughout the land?"
20047,TYRION: I will never sit on the Iron Throne.
20048,"VARYS: No, you won’t. But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat. The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen, but gentler than Stannis. A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people. A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name."
20049,TYRION: Good luck finding him.
20050,"VARYS: Who said anything about him? You have a choice my friend. You can stay here at Ilyrio’s palace and drink yourself to death, or you can ride with me to Mereen, meet Daenerys Targaryen, and decide if the world is worth fighting for."
20051,TYRION: Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen?
20052,CUT TO: MEEREEN
20053,NARRATOR:The Unsullied march through the streets.
20054,DAARIO NAHARIS: When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen? Looks like your friends haven’t been behaving themselves.
20055,"HIZDAHR ZO LORAQ: The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success. The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders, made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders. All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review."
20056,DAENERYS: Good.
20057,HIZDAHR: They did ask for some concessions.
20058,DAENERYS: Concessions?
20059,"HIZDAHR: Politics is the art of compromise, your grace."
20060,DAENERYS: I’m not a politician. I’m a queen.
20061,"HIZDAHR: Forgive me. You’re right, of course. Still, it’s easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones."
20062,"DAENERYS: I don’t expect the Wise Masters to be happy. Slavery made them rich, I ended slavery."
20063,HIZDAHR: They do not ask for the return of slavery. They ask for the re-opening of the fighting pits.
20064,DAENERYS: The fighting pits? Where slaves fought slaves to the death?
20065,"HIZDAHR: In the new world that you’ve brought to us, free men would fight free men."
20066,NARRATOR:Daario takes out his sword and smiles at Daenerys.
20067,HIZDAHR: The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity. Bring some here and ask them yourself.
20068,DAENERYS: No fighting pits.
20069,HIZDAHR: Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions.
20070,DAENERYS: I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting.
20071,HIZDAHR: If you--
20072,DAENERYS: How many times must I say no before you understand?
20073,DAENERYS: Whatever he wants from me he’s not going to get it. If he really believes I’m going to reopen the fighting pits…
20074,DAARIO: You should reopen the fighting pits.
20075,DAENERYS: What?
20076,"DAARIO: My mother was a whore, I told you that. She liked to drink pear brandy. The older she got, the less she made selling her body, the more she wanted to drink. So one day when I was 12, she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before."
20077,DAENERYS: Why?
20078,"DAARIO: I was a bad child. I wasn’t big, but I was quick. And I loved to fight. So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits. I had my first match when I was 16."
20079,"DAENERYS: You were sold into slavery, forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters, and you’re defending the fighting pits?"
20080,"DAARIO: I’m only here because of those pits. I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer, a Norvoshi priest, a Westerosi knight. Soon I was famous. 10,000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit. I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died. I joined the Second Sons, and then I met you."
20081,NARRATOR:A long pause.
20082,"DAARIO: You’re the queen. Everyone’s too afraid of you to speak truth. Everyone but me. You’ve made thousands of enemies all across the world. As soon as they see weakness, they’ll attack. Show your strength here, now."
20083,DAENERYS: That’s why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets.
20084,DAARIO (scoffs): Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied. You’re not the Mother of Unsullied. You’re the Mother of Dragons.
20085,DAENERYS: I don’t want another child’s bones dropped at my feet. No one’s seen Drogon in weeks. For all I know he’s flown halfway across the world. I can’t control them anymore.
20086,DAARIO: A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen.
20087,NARRATOR:INT. DRAGON PIT
20088,NARRATOR:Daenerys walks into the room the dragons are being held. She hears chains rattling.
20089,DAENERYS: Viserion? Rhaegal?
20090,"NARRATOR:The two fully grown dragons start snapping, screaming, and breathing fire at her."
20091,DAENERYS: Easy. Easy. Easy.
20092,"NARRATOR:They keep breathing fire and roaring so she leaves the room, terrified."

20096,NARRATOR:Jon Snow enters the room.
20097,MANCE: So here we are.
20098,JON: Here we are.
20099,"MANCE: When we first met you were my prisoner. And now, for our last meeting…"
20100,JON: This doesn’t have to be our last meeting.
20101,"MANCE: No, but it will be."
20102,JON: You know what Stannis wants?
20103,MANCE: He wants me to bend the knee. And he wants the free folk to fight for him. I’ll give him this much: he’s bold.
20104,JON: Shouldn’t a king be bold?
20105,"MANCE: Oh, aye. I respect him. If he gets what he wants, I expect he’ll be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years. But I’ll never serve him."
20106,JON: You told me you weren’t here to conquer. You told me your people have bled enough.
20107,MANCE: That’s right. But I don’t want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either.
20108,"JON: You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history. Thenns and Hornfoots, the ice-river clans, even the giants. A life’s work uniting them. You didn’t do it for power. You didn’t do it for glory. You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter, not if they’re north of the wall. Isn’t their survival more important than your pride?"
20109,MANCE: Pride? Fuck my pride. This isn’t about that.
20110,JON: Then bend the knee and save your people.
20111,MANCE: They followed me because they respected me. Because they believed in me. The moment I kneel for a Southern king that’s all gone.
20112,JON: And how many tens of thousands are out there right now? How many women? How many children? And you won’t go out and rescue them because why? You’re afraid of looking afraid.
20113,"MANCE: Oh, I am afraid. No shame in that. How will they do it? Beheading? Hanging?"
20114,JON: They’ll burn you alive.
20115,"MANCE: Bad way to go. I’ll be honest with you, I don’t want to die. And burnt to death, I don’t want people to remember me like that. Scorched and screaming. But it’s better than betraying everything I believe."
20116,"JON: And what happens to your people? You preserve your dignity and die standing, and they’ll sing songs about you. “You’d rather burn than kneel. The great hero.” Until winter comes, and the white walkers come for us all, and there’s no one left to sing."
20117,"MANCE: You’re a good lad. Truly, you are. But if you can’t understand why I won’t enlist my people in a foreigner’s war, there’s no point explaining."
20118,"NARRATOR:Jon walks to the door, then turns around."
20119,JON: I think you’re making a terrible mistake.
20120,MANCE: The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted.
20121,NARRATOR:Jon nods then leaves the room.
20122,NARRATOR:Members of the Night’s Watch escort Mance to Stannis.
20123,"STANNIS: Mance Rayder, you’ve been called the King Beyond the Wall. Westeros only has one king. Bend the knee, I promise you mercy."
20124,"NARRATOR:Mance looks at the Free Folk, including Tormund, the Night’s Watch have chained up. Then he looks at Jon Snow."
20125,STANNIS: Kneel and live.
20126,MANCE: This was my home for many years. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.
20127,NARRATOR:Stannis nods. His men take Mance onto the burning funeral pyre and tie him to it. Melisandre walks to the front of the pyre.
20128,"MELISANDRE: Man or woman, young or old, lord or peasant, our choices are the same. We choose light, or we choose darkness. We choose good, or we choose evil. We choose the true god or the false."
20129,NARRATOR:She picks up a torch.
20130,"MELISANDRE: Free folk, there is only one true king, and his name is Stannis. Here stands the king of lies. Behold the fate of those who choose the darkness."
20131,"NARRATOR:She lights the pyre. Mance starts panicking as the fire reaches his legs. Jon Snow walks up to a high point and shoots Mance in the heart with an arrow, killing him."
20132,NARRATOR:Melisandre looks at the icicles hanging outside her tent and sees that they are melting.
20133,"NARRATOR:Melisandre walks to find Stannis, stepping in a pile of mud on the way."
20134,NARRATOR:Stannis straps his armor on.
20135,"MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light has made good on his promise, my king. His fires have melted the snows away. The way ahead is clear."
20136,STANNIS: We ride for Winterfell.
20137,MELISANDRE: And you will take it. The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning. You will receive what is yours by right.
20138,NARRATOR:Melisandre wraps her arms around Stannis. He brushes her off then exits the tent. She follows after him.

20141,SOLDIER: Your Grace.
20142,STANNIS: Prepare to form up.
20143,SOLDIER: Your Grace.
20144,NARRATOR:The soldier waits for a response from Stannis.
20145,STANNIS: Tell me.
20146,SOLDIER: The men. Many deserted before dawn.
20147,STANNIS: How many?
20148,"SOLDIER: Nearly half. All the sell-swords, with all the horses."
20149,NARRATOR:Stannis is speechless. He looks to Melisandre who appears even more devastated than he. Another soldier comes up to Stannis.
20150,SOLDIER 2: Your Grace?
20151,STANNIS: Speak up. It can’t be worse than mutiny.
20152,NARRATOR:The man is silent.
20153,NARRATOR:EXT. WOODS OUTSIDE STANNIS’S CAMP
20154,NARRATOR:Stannis is led by his men to a tree. Stannis looks up and sees Selyse hanging from it. Stannis takes a long look but tries not to reveal his emotions.
20155,STANNIS: Cut her down.
20156,NARRATOR:The men cut the noose and bring her to the ground.
20157,SOLDIER: Your Grace. The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp.
20158,NARRATOR:Stannis seethes but says nothing.
20159,STANNIS: Get the men into marching formation. On to Winterfell.
20160,NARRATOR:Stannis walks from the woods back to camp.
20161,"JON: He raised his hands. And they all stood up at once. Tens of thousands of them, the biggest army in the world."
20162,SAM: So what are you gonna do?
20163,JON: I’m gonna hope they don’t learn how to climb the wall.
20164,SAM: But… the Dragonglass?
20165,"JON (shakes his head): No one’s ever getting that back, now. It wouldn’t have mattered anyway, unless we had a mountain of it."
20166,SAM (confused): But… you killed a White Walker.
20167,JON: With Longclaw. I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass. But Longclaw…
20168,SAM: He’s made of Valyrian steel. How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms?
20169,JON: Not enough. (pause) The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings. How’s it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black? (smiles)
20170,SAM: You were friends with me when I first got here. And I wasn’t winning any elections back then.
20171,JON: Here’s to us then. Long may they sneer.
20172,NARRATOR:Jon and Sam clink glasses and drink. Sam looks to Jon.
20173,JON: What?
20174,"SAM: I wanted to ask you something. To ask something of you. Send me, Gilly, and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester. That’s what I’m meant to be, not this."
20175,"JON: I need you here, Sam. If you leave, who’s left to give me advice I trust?"
20176,"SAM: Well, there’s Edd."
20177,NARRATOR:Jon gives Sam a look.

20293,JAQEN: ...the faces are as good as poison.
20294,NARRATOR:Arya pulls off the final face and sees her own face staring back at her.

20312,MYRCELLA: I’ll never take it off again.
20313,JAIME: I know you didn’t want to leave Dorne. But I’m glad you’re coming home. Your mother’s desperate to see you. And I’m glad Trystane’s coming with us. He seems like a nice boy. You’re lucky. Arranged marriages are rarely so… so well arranged.
20314,MYRCELLA: Do you think mother will like him.
20315,"JAIME: If she sees you’re happy, I’m sure she will."
20316,MYRCELLA (laughing): And you really believe that?
20317,JAIME (smiles): Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children?
20318,MYRCELLA: She likes you.
20319,"JAIME: I’m not so sure about that. Listen. There’s something I’ve wanted to tell you. Something I should have told you long ago. So. Now that you’ve seen more of the world, you’ve learned how complicated things can be. People can be. The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years, but you’ve fallen in love with Trystane. It was an accident, really, I mean what were the chances? You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry? (Myrcella laughs) My point is… we don’t choose whom we love. We just… It’s beyond our control. I sound like an idiot."
20320,MYRCELLA: No you don’t.
20321,JAIME: What I’m trying to say. What I’m trying and failing to say…

20325,MYRCELLA: I do.
20326,NARRATOR:She takes his good hand in hers.

20330,NARRATOR:The bleeding gets worse.
20331,JAIME: Myrcella?!
20332,"NARRATOR:Myrcella collapses in Jaime’s arms, blood streaming down her face."
20333,JAIME: Myrcella?! Myrcella?!
20334,NARRATOR:Ellaria stares at Jaime’s ship from the dock. Blood begins to trickle out of her nose and splatter the floor.

20335,"NARRATOR:Tyrion, Daario, and Jorah sit on the steps in Dany’s throne room."
20336,"TYRION (to Jorah): You love her, don’t you? How could you not. Of course, it’s hopeless for the both of you. Sellsword from the fighting pits, a disgraced knight. Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen. But, we always want the wrong woman."
20337,DAARIO: Does he always talk so much?
20338,"NARRATOR:Jorah nods. Missandei brings Grey Worm into the room, with bandages around his torso."
20339,GREY WORM: Jorah the Andal.
20340,JORAH: Torgo Nudho.
20341,GREY WORM: You should not be here.
20342,"DAARIO: No, but he is."
20343,GREY WORM: Our queen ordered him exiled from city.
20344,DAARIO: Our queen would be dead if not for him.
20345,MISSANDEI (Valyrian): It’s true. And I would be dead if not for the… (look at Tyrion) little man.
20346,TYRION (Valyrian): Dwarf. I believe that’s the word. Apologies. My Valyrian is a bit “nostril”.
20347,MISSANDEI: (Valyrian) A bit “rusty”.
20348,TYRION: (Valyrian) “Rusty” (Common Tongue) Thank you.
20349,GREY WORM: I am sorry. Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen.
20350,DAARIO: You missed a good scrap.
20351,JORAH: None of that matters now. The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness.
20352,"TYRION: He’s right. The dragon headed north. If we’re going to find her, that’s where we’re to go."
20353,JORAH: We? You’re a Lannister. The Queen intends to remove your family from power.
20354,TYRION: And I intend to help her do it.
20355,JORAH: You’ve been here for how many days now? I’ve fought for her for years. Since she was little more than a child.
20356,TYRION: You betrayed her!
20357,JORAH: Careful now.
20358,"TYRION: And she exiled you, twice, I believe?"
20359,JORAH: The second time thanks to you.
20360,"TYRION: Don’t blame me for your crimes, Mormont."
20361,"DAARIO: (gestures to Tyrion) He’s right. The Queen exiled Jorah. (gestures to Jorah) And he’s right, Jorah saved her life. Perhaps she feels differently about him now. Perhaps not. The only way we’ll know is if we ask her."
20362,"TYRION: Fine, fine, I suppose he can join us. Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep."
20363,JORAH: If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open.
20364,"DAARIO (to Tyrion): Forgive me, but why would we bring you?"
20365,TYRION: Pardon me?
20366,DAARIO: Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness?
20367,"TYRION: Not precisely, but I have other skills that’d be very useful--"
20368,DAARIO: Can you fight?
20369,TYRION: I have fought. I don’t claim to be a great warrior.
20370,DAARIO: Are you good on a horse?
20371,TYRION: Middling.
20372,DAARIO: So mainly you talk?
20373,TYRION: And drink. I’ve survived so far.
20374,"DAARIO: Which I respect. But you would not help us on this expedition. You would help us here in Meereen, though. (to Missandei, Grey Worm, and Jorah) None of us have any experience governing a city, except for him. You want to prove your value to the queen? Prove it right here in Meereen."
20375,JORAH: He’s a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language. Why would the Meereenese listen to him?
20376,DAARIO: They wouldn’t. They will listen to Grey Worm.
20377,GREY WORM: I’ll come with you. I’ll find our queen.
20378,MISSANDEI: You are not strong enough to go anywhere.
20379,GREY WORM: I am.
20380,"DAARIO: He is, he’s the toughest man with no balls I’ve ever met. But you still can’t go. The people believe in you. They know you speak for the queen."
20381,"MISSANDEI: It’s true. Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen. If you leave, half the city will consume the other half."
20382,"DAARIO: And Missandei. Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei. Certainly not me. The queen’s closest confidant, the commander of the Unsullied, and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face. Good fortune, my friends, Meereen is ancient and glorious. (to Tyrion) Try not to ruin her. (to Jorah) Looks like it’s you and me, Jorah the Andal. Let’s find some good horses. We have so much to talk about."
20383,NARRATOR:Tyrion walks down the steps towards Missandei and Grey Worm. They exchange uncertain glances with each other.
20384,NARRATOR:Tyrion stands in the place where Dany had Mossador executed and watches Jorah and Daario ride out of the city.
20385,"VOICE (O.S.): Hello, old friend."
20386,NARRATOR:Tyrion turns to see Varys on the balcony next to him.
20387,VARYS: I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me.
20388,TYRION: I suppose there’s no point in asking how you found me.
20389,"VARYS: The birds sing in the west, the birds sing in the east. If one knows how to listen. They tell me you’ve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons."
20390,"TYRION: Well, she didn’t execute me, so that’s a promising start. Now the heroes are off to find her, and I’m stuck here, trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war. Any advice for an old comrade?"
20391,VARYS: Information is the key. You need to learn your enemies’ strengths and strategies. You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends.
20392,TYRION: If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies.
20393,"VARYS: If only. (beat) A grand old city, choking on violence, corruption, and deceit. Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive, ungainly beast?"
20394,NARRATOR:Tyrion looks up to Varys with a slight smile.
20395,TYRION: I did miss you.
20396,"VARYS: Oh, I know."

20399,NARRATOR:Drogon lies down and grunts.

20401,NARRATOR:Daenerys pets his nose but gets no response.
20402,DAENERYS: How far did you carry me? (surveys the area)
20403,NARRATOR:Drogon begins turning away from her to lick at his wounds.
20404,"DAENERYS: Drogon, we need to return. My people need me."
20405,"NARRATOR:She climbs back on his back, but he hisses and bucks her off, then goes to sleep."
20406,"DAENERYS: Well, there’s no food. At the very least you can hunt us some supper."
20407,"NARRATOR:Dany begins walking across the plateau to explore. A horse gallops in the distance. Camera cuts to reveal the pony-tail of a Dothraki. Three more Dothraki men arrive on horseback. Daenerys drops her ring to the ground. Another group of Dothraki arrives, and then the rest of the khalasar. They begin circling around Daenerys, howling."

20412,NARRATOR:Cersei is knelt before the High Sparrow in the room where she was taken away.
20413,"CERSEI: I have sinned. I see that now. How could I have been so blind for so long. I want to be clean again. I want absolution. The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high, and with its holy light--"
20414,HIGH SPARROW: You wish to make a confession?
20415,"CERSEI: Once I’ve confessed, will I be free?"
20416,SPARROW: Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins.
20417,"CERSEI: The Mother have mercy then. I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage, I confess."
20418,SPARROW: Name him.
20419,CERSEI: Lancel Lannister.
20420,SPARROW: Your cousin. And the King’s squire.
20421,CERSEI: I was lonely and afraid.
20422,SPARROW: You had a husband.
20423,CERSEI: A husband of whoring every chance he got.
20424,SPARROW: His sins do not pardon your own.
20425,CERSEI: May the gods forgive me.
20426,SPARROW: Other men?
20427,CERSEI: No.
20428,SPARROW: No others?
20429,CERSEI: No.
20430,SPARROW: Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime. You understand this?
20431,CERSEI: I do.
20432,SPARROW: There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert. That they are bastards born of incest and adultery.
20433,"CERSEI: A lie. A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon. He wants the Throne, but his brother’s children stand in his way, so he claims they are not his brothers’. The filth. There is not one shred of truth to it. I deny it."
20434,"SPARROW: Good. But these are terrible charges. And the realm must know the truth of them. If Your Grace has given honest testimony, your trial will prove your innocence."
20435,CERSEI: Trial? I have confessed?
20436,SPARROW: To a single sin. Others you have denied. Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods.
20437,CERSEI: I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness. But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mother’s mercy. I haven’t seen my son… I don’t know how long it’s been. I need to see him. Please.
20438,"SPARROW: You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness. In light of this, I will permit you to return to the Red Keep."

20447,"NARRATOR:Cersei is stripped naked and has the dirt washed off of her by the septas. After they scrub her clean, they sit her down and begin chopping her hair away with a knife. They leave her naked, with short hair and a bloody scalp, and then shut the door on her."
20448,"NARRATOR:Cersei is carried to the top of the steps, in front of a massive crowd of King’s Landing citizens."
20449,"SPARROW: A sinner comes before you. Cersei of House Lannister, mother to his Grace King Tommen, widow to his Grace King Robert. She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication. She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness. To demonstrate her repentance, she will cast aside all pride, all artifice, and present herself as the gods made her, to you. The good people of the city. She comes before you with a solemn heart. Shorn of secrets. Naked before the eyes of gods and men. To make her walk of atonement."

20471,"JON: The wildlings won’t ever fight for Stannis, I told you before--"

20561,NARRATOR:Podrick gets up and leaves
20562,BAELISH: Do you like the taste?
20563,SANSA: I don't see what all the fuss is about. Why do men love it so much?
20564,BAELISH: It gives some men courage.
20565,SANSA: Does it give you courage?
20566,NARRATOR:Brienne shows up and Baelish's knights get in her way
20567,GUARD: That's far enough.
20568,"BRIENNE: Lord Baelish, Lady Sansa, my name is Brienne of Tarth."
20569,"BAELISH: We've met. With Renly Baratheon. What did he say about you? He said, ""You're a loyalty comes free of charge."" Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then."
20570,NARRATOR:Baelish gestures to the knights to welcome her; Brienne goes through and takes a knee in front of Sansa
20571,"BRIENNE: Lady Sansa, before your mother's death, I was her sworn sword. I gave my word I would find you and protect you. I will shield your back and keep your council, and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
20572,"BAELISH: Please, Lady Brienne. No need for such formality. (Brienne gets up) You are Catelyn Stark's sworn sword?"
20573,BRIENNE: I was.
20574,BAELISH: Strange. I knew Cat from the time we were children. She never mentioned you.
20575,BRIENNE: It was after Renly's murder.
20576,"BAELISH: Ah, yes. You were accused of killing him."
20577,BRIENNE: I tried to save him.
20578,BAELISH: But you were accused.
20579,BRIENNE: By men who didn't see what happened.
20580,BAELISH: Then what did happen?
20581,BRIENNE: He was murdered by a shadow. A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon.
20582,BAELISH: A shadow? With a face? (scoffs) This woman swore to protect Renly; she failed. She swore to protect your mother; she failed. Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa?
20583,BRIENNE: Why should you have any say in her affairs?
20584,"BAELISH: Because I am her uncle. I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloved’s untimely death. We're family now, and you're an outsider. Forgive me, Lady Brienne, but experiences made me wary of outsiders."
20585,"BRIENNE: Lady Sansa, if we can have a word alone--"
20586,SANSA: No.
20587,"BRIENNE: Please, my lady. If I could explain--"
20588,SANSA: I saw you at Joffrey's wedding bowing to the king.
20589,BRIENNE: Neither of us wanted to be there. Sometimes we don't have a choice.
20590,SANSA: And sometimes we do. You should leave.
20591,BAELISH: We don't want our new friend wandering the countryside alone. The roads of these parts aren't safe. Why don't you stay?

20608,BRIENNE: You can stand now.
20609,"PODRICK: Yes, my lady. (stands) Sansa Stark?"
20610,"BRIENNE: Wary of strangers, as she should me. I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger. We’ll follow them."
20611,"PODRICK: My lady, if those Stark girls refused your service, maybe you’re released from your vow."
20612,BRIENNE: I swore to their mother I’d protect those girls.
20613,PODRICK: If they don’t want your protection--
20614,BRIENNE: Do you think she’s safe from Littlefinger?
20615,"PODRICK: (pause) No, my lady."
20616,BRIENNE: Get your horse.

20620,JAIME: It’s a threat.
20621,"CERSEI: Of course it’s a threat! Our daughter’s in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family. (mocking) ""It's a threat."""
20622,JAIME: No note.
20623,"CERSEI: They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister, and every other tragedy that’s befallen their cursed country. I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her!"
20624,JAIME: Softer.
20625,CERSEI: What?
20626,JAIME: Not so loud.
20627,"CERSEI: Our daughter’s in danger, and you’re worried I’m speaking too loudly!"
20628,JAIME: The world can't know knows she’s our daughter.
20629,CERSEI: Then don’t call her your daughter. You’ve never been a father to her.
20630,"JAIME: If I was the father to any of my children, they’d be stoned in the streets."
20631,CERSEI: And what has your caution brought? Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding. Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne. Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden.
20632,JAIME: I’ll make things better.
20633,CERSEI: You never made anything better.
20634,JAIME: I’m going to Dorne. I’ll bring our daughter home.
20635,CERSEI: You can’t just ask Prince Doran to give her back! She’s promised his son.
20636,JAIME: I’m not going to ask him anything.
20637,"CERSEI: You go there with an army, it’s an act of war."
20638,JAIME: No army. Do you know where they’re keeping her?
20639,CERSEI: Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens.
20640,"JAIME: I’ll find her. Is there anything else, your grace?"

20643,NARRATOR:Bronn is skipping stones.
20644,"LOLLYS STOKEWORTH: No sunflowers. I don't like yellow. Roses are very nice, definitely roses. And music. I adore music. But no flutes, I hate flutes! We can have a harp if you like, but no flutes. Then there's the food. Food is the most important thing, don't you agree? We're going to need pigeon pies. That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?"
20645,NARRATOR:Bronn has been skipping stones and ignoring her.
20646,LOLLYS: Don't they?
20647,BRONN: Don't who?
20648,LOLLYS: People eat pigeon pie in the capital.

20653,LOLLYS: You won't.
20654,BRONN: Pardon?
20655,"LOLLYS: We won't get to live at Stokeworth. When Mother dies, my sister gets the castle because she's older."
20656,BRONN: Oh.
20657,"LOLLYS: She hates me. She calls me mean names, and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isn't looking."
20658,BRONN: You know what I think? I think you're a good person. And your sister is a mean person.
20659,LOLLYS: She is.
20660,"BRONN: I've been all over the world. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that meanness comes around. People like your sister, they always get what's coming to them eventually. One way or another."
20661,NARRATOR:They stop walking. Bronn looks at someone in the distance.
20662,LOLLYS: Who's that?

20675,BRONN: Just get on with it.
20676,JAIME: On with what?
20677,BRONN: What you're here for. There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.
20678,JAIME: It's very good for you.
20679,NARRATOR:Jaime goes into his coat and pulls out a scroll. He hands it to Bronn.
20680,BRONN: Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken.
20681,JAIME: Mmm.
20682,"BRONN: We made a deal, your sister and I."
20683,JAIME: I would have advised against that.
20684,BRONN: How is this good for me?
20685,"JAIME: 'Cause you're going to come with me and help me with something important. And when we return, I'm going to give you a much better girl, and a much better castle."
20686,BRONN: Return from where?
20687,JAIME: As far south as south goes.

20690,NARRATOR:Ellaria glowers from the balcony at Trystane Martell escorting Myrcella through the Water Gardens. Trystane looks up and sees her. Ellaria walks towards Doran's place on the balcony and is blocked by Areo Hotah.
20691,AREO: The prince does not wish to be disturbed.

20694,"NARRATOR:Areo reluctantly steps to the side. Ellaria approaches Prince Doran, staring at the Water Gardens from his wheelchair."
20695,"ELLARIA: Your brother was murdered, and you sit here at the Water Gardens, staring at the sky and doing nothing."
20696,"DORAN: Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat. By law, that is not murder."
20697,ELLARIA: Your brother--
20698,DORAN: You don't have to remind me. He was my brother long before he was anything to you.
20699,ELLARIA: What will you do about his death.
20700,DORAN: I will bury him. I will mourn for him.
20701,ELLARIA: You would have me go to war?
20702,DORAN: You would have me go to war?
20703,ELLARIA: The whole country would have you go to war.
20704,DORAN: Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide.
20705,ELLARIA: The Sand Snakes are with me. They have the love of their people. They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing.
20706,NARRATOR:Doran says nothing. Cut back to Trystane and Myrcella in the Water Gardens.
20707,"ELLARIA: Oberyn is dead. And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food, breathing our air. How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill?"
20708,NARRATOR:Let me have her. Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time.
20709,DORAN: I loved my brother. And you made him very happy. For that you will always have a place in my heart. But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance. Not here. Not while I rule.
20710,ELLARIA: And how long will that be?
20711,NARRATOR:Ellaria exits the room. Areo goes back to guarding the door. Doran shakes his head.

20715,"DAARIO: Anyone can see you coming from a mile off. Of course you haven't found any Sons of the Harpy. You haven't, have you?"
20716,"NARRATOR:Grey Worm grunts a ""no""."
20717,"DAARIO: My Second Sons, on the other hand, they drink, they whore, fight in the streets--they blend in. They overhear things in taverns, follow people from the taverns to nice, quiet alleys, break a few fingers, overhear a few more things. Before you know it..."
20718,"NARRATOR:Daario has brought them to a door. Grey Worm knocks it in and rushes the room. He, Daario, and an Unsullied inspect the room quietly."
20719,GREY WORM: No one here. We go.
20720,DAARIO: In a hurry? You're afraid?
20721,GREY WORM: Unsullied fear nothing.
20722,"DAARIO: Right. That's your problem. You understood fear once, long ago, but you've forgotten what it means. Someone who's forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide."
20723,"NARRATOR:Daario quickly pulls a dagger out, and stabs into a wall covered by a bookcase that immediately gives way. A man screams and falls out of the wall."
20724,DAARIO: Fear is useful that way.
20725,NARRATOR:He pats Grey Worm on the shoulder. The Unsullied soldier grabs the man. Grey Worm searches the hiding place and finds daggers laying on the ground with a Sons of the Harpy mask.
20726,"MOSSADOR: Sons of the Harpy, they want to put a collar back on my neck. On all of our necks. Please, Your Grace, you must kill him."
20727,DAENERYS: It would send a message.
20728,"BARRISTAN: I think you should exercise restraint, Your Grace."
20729,DAENERYS: Why?
20730,"BARRISTAN: For one thing, he may have valuable information."
20731,DAARIO: The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information.
20732,BARRISTAN: How do you know that?
20733,DAARIO: Because I questioned him.
20734,"HIZDAHR: And the information you did get, he is young and poor."
20735,MOSSADOR: He is born free.
20736,HIZDAHR: Why should he want to bring back slavery? What did it do for him?
20737,DAENERYS: Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was.
20738,MOSSADOR: They pay him. Great families afraid to do a thing. They pay poor man to do it for them.
20739,HIZDAHR: And how do you know this?
20740,MOSSADOR: Everyone knows this.
20741,"HIZDAHR: I don't know it, and I'm the head of a great family."
20742,"BARRISTAN: We do not know what this man did or didn't do. (to Daenerys) Give him a trial, at least. A fair trial. Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose. Teach them a better way."
20743,"MOSSADOR: I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes. Things maybe are different there, I hope. But here, in Meereen, before Daenerys Stormborn, they own us. So we learn much about them or we do not live long. They teach me what they are. Mercy, fair trial: these mean nothing to them. All they understand is blood!"
20744,NARRATOR:They all look to Daenerys.
20745,DAENERYS: Thank you all for your counsel.
20746,NARRATOR:Everyone gets up from the table and exits the room besides Ser Barristan.
20747,"BARRISTAN: Your Grace, a word, please, I beg you."
20748,DAENERYS: About what?
20749,BARRISTAN: About your father. About the Mad King.
20750,DAENERYS: The Mad King? You're here to remind me of my enemies' lies? Consider me reminded.
20751,"BARRISTAN: Your Grace, I served in his Kingsguard. I was at his side from the first.  Your enemies did not lie."
20752,DAENERYS: Go on.
20753,"BARRISTAN: When the people rose in revolt against him, your father set their towns and castles aflame. He murdered sons in front of their fathers. He burned men alive with Wildfire, and laughed as they screamed. And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two."
20754,DAENERYS: I'm not my father.
20755,"BARRISTAN: No, Your Grace. Thank the gods. But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved. And each time it made him feel powerful and right. Until the very end."
20756,DAENERYS: I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial.
20757,BARRISTAN (nods): Your Grace.
20758,TYRION: There's a bug.
20759,"VARYS: Yes, best be careful. You might accidentally consume some solid food."
20760,"TYRION: When I agreed to come with you, did I misrepresent my intentions? (finishes his cup of wine) Besides, what is there for me to do inside this fucking box?"
20761,VARYS: You don't like it?
20762,TYRION: I want to take a walk.
20763,VARYS: You can't. Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head.
20764,"TYRION: She ought to offer her cunt. Best part of her for the best part of me. Well, I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere."
20765,VARYS: Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything?
20766,TYRION: You're right. No point. (realizing) The road to Volantis? You said we were going to Meereen. What's in Volantis?
20767,VARYS: The road to Meereen.
20768,TYRION: And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen?
20769,VARYS: I told you. A ruler.
20770,TYRION: We've already got a ruler. Everywhere has already got a ruler. Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someone's banner hanging from it.
20771,"VARYS: You were quite good, you know. At ruling. During your brief tenure as Hand."
20772,TYRION: I didn't rule. I was a servant.
20773,"VARYS: Still, a man of talent."
20774,TYRION: Managed to kill a lot of people.
20775,"VARYS: Yes, but showed great promise in other areas as well."
20776,TYRION: She wanted me to leave King's Landing. She begged me. I wouldn't go.
20777,VARYS: Why?
20778,TYRION: 'Cause I liked it. Power. Even as a servant. (takes a drink of wine)
20779,VARYS: People follow leaders. And they will never follow us. They find us repulsive.
20780,TYRION: I find us repulsive.
20781,"VARYS: And we find them repulsive, which is why we surround ourselves with large, comfortable boxes to keep them away. And yet, no matter what we do, people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box. Not for long."
20782,TYRION: You're right. Let's go for a walk.
20783,VARYS: No.
20784,TYRION: How many dwarves are there in the world? Is Cersei going to kill them all?
20785,NARRATOR:A dwarf head is placed on her desk.
20786,CERSEI: Not him.
20787,"MERYN: Are you trying to deceive your Queen? Shall I throw them in a cell, Your Grace?"
20788,"CERSEI: That won't be necessary, Ser Meryn. I don't want to dissuade the other hunters. Mistakes will be made."
20789,"HUNTERS: Thank you, Your Grace. Thank you."
20790,CERSEI: Take the head.
20791,"QYBURN: Pardon me, Your Grace. I would take it, if you don't mind. It could prove useful for my work."
20792,CERSEI: Very good.
20793,NARRATOR:She and Qyburn exit the room.
20794,QYBURN: Over there will be fine.
20795,MERYN (to hunters): You heard the man. Over there.
20796,NARRATOR:The hunters pick up the dwarf head.
20797,"NARRATOR:Cersei and Qyburn enter the room, taking the open seats on the small council. Cersei sits at the head of the table."
20798,KEVAN: You're the Hand of the King?
20799,"CERSEI: No, Uncle. Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role. I'm merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself."
20800,"MACE TYRELL: Your Grace, I would be willing to serve provisionally as the King's Hand until he becomes old enough--"
20801,"CERSEI: You're a good man, Lord Tyrell, but I don't imagine you'll have the time. In addition to being Master of Ships, the king has appointed you Master of Coin."
20802,"MACE: Oh, Your Grace."
20803,CERSEI: He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled. He said he would be honored to have you represent the crown's interests in the same.
20804,"MACE: The honor is all mine, Your Grace."
20805,"PYCELLE: Your Grace, in the past on several occasions, a Grand Maester has served as the King's Hand."
20806,CERSEI: The King has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers.
20807,"PYCELLE: Your Grace, him? This man? This embarrassment to the Citadel? Your Grace, what qualifications can he possibly have for this post?"
20808,"CERSEI: The qualification of loyalty, Grand Maester. That's far more than the eunuch ever had. Far more than many ever have."
20809,PYCELLE: I must say I cannot see--
20810,"CERSEI (cutting him off): Uncle Kevan, in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies, it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War. No man living better deserves the title."
20811,KEVAN: That is kind of you to say. I would like to hear it from the king himself.
20812,CERSEI: The king is very busy at this moment.
20813,"KEVAN: He should be here, learning what it means to rule."
20814,"CERSEI: He is learning. On this occasion, in his capacity as ruler, he's asked me to speak on his behalf."
20815,KEVAN: I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother. And to you. And to serve the king. I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet. To watch you stack the small council with sycophants. (looks to Qyburn) Sending your own brother away so he wouldn't be--
20816,CERSEI: My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission.
20817,KEVAN: What mission?
20818,CERSEI: That is not your concern as Master of War.
20819,KEVAN: I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern. You are the Queen Mother. Nothing more.
20820,NARRATOR:Kevan gets up from his seat.
20821,CERSEI: You would abandon your king in his time of need?
20822,"KEVAN: If he wants to send for me, I will be waiting for him. At Casterly Rock."
20823,NARRATOR:He exits the room and closes the door.
20824,"NARRATOR:Shireen runs her finger over the letter ""S"" in her book."
20825,SHIREEN: Come on. You know this one. It looks like an animal.
20826,GILLY: Snake. Snake... S! It's an S!
20827,"SHIREEN: Right, very good!"
20828,NARRATOR:Sam is reading in a different aisle in the library.
20829,"SAM: Hmm! Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history, Osric Stark, was elected at the age of 10?"
20830,NARRATOR:Gilly and Shireen look to him and then back at their book.
20831,"GILLY: I know ""S""."
20832,"SHIREEN: You'll learn, I promise. I taught Ser Davos, and old people are terrible at learning new things."
20833,"GILLY: Well, you're a wonderful teacher. (to Sam) Very patient!"
20834,"SAM: I only said that the more time you spend practicing, the faster you'll be able to read."
20835,GILLY: That's alright. We're doing just fine. I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.
20836,NARRATOR:Sam goes back to his book.
20837,GILLY (to Shireen): How old were you when you learned to read?
20838,SHIREEN: Three.
20839,"SAM (interjecting): Three?! Who taught you, your mother?"
20840,SHIREEN: No. Old Maester Cressen did. I had a lot of time to practice. My mother kept me inside because... (trails off)
20841,"GILLY (gently): What do you call it in the South, what happened to your face?"
20842,SHIREEN: Greyscale. What do you call it north of the Wall?
20843,GILLY: I don't know. But two of my sisters had it. They both died. How did they cure you?
20844,"SHIREEN: I don't remember. I was a baby. Lots of people came and tried, I think. Whatever they did, it went away. What happened to your sisters?"
20845,GILLY: My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside. None of us were allowed to go near them. But we heard them. Especially at night. They started to sound... not like themselves.
20846,SAM: Did you ever see them?
20847,"GILLY: Only once at the end. They were covered with it. Their faces, their arms. They acted like animals. My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope."
20848,SHIREEN: What did he do to them in the woods?
20849,NARRATOR:Gilly is afraid to answer. Selyse enters the room before she can.
20850,SHIREEN: Mother.
20851,SELYSE (to Sam and Gilly): Leave us.
20852,SAM (nodding): Your Grace.
20853,NARRATOR:Sam and Gilly exit the room.
20854,SELYSE: You need to stay away from that girl.
20855,SHIREEN: Why?
20856,SELYSE: She's a wildling.
20857,SHIREEN: Her name's Gilly. She's nice. I'm teaching her to read.
20858,SELYSE: She's a wildling. Your father defeated their people. He executed her king for treason. They could strike at him by striking at you.
20859,SHIREEN: Gilly wouldn't do that.
20860,SELYSE: You have no idea what people will do. All your books and you still don't know.
20861,NARRATOR:Selyse exits the library.
20862,"STANNIS: I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake. You prevented that order from being carried out. You showed mercy to Mance Rayder. A king's word is law. Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers. Show too much kindness, people won't fear you. If people don't fear you, they don't follow you."
20863,"JON: With respect, Your Grace, the free folk will never follow you, no matter what you do. You're the man who burned their king alive."
20864,STANNIS: Who then? You?
20865,JON: No. Only one of their own.
20866,STANNIS: Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont?
20867,JON: The Lord Commander's niece.
20868,"STANNIS: Lady of Bear Island, and a child of 10. I asked her to commit her house to my cause, that's her response."
20869,"JON: ""Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North, whose name is Stark."" (Jon smiles)"
20870,STANNIS: That amuses you?
20871,"JON: I apologize, Your Grace. Northerners can be a bit like the free folk. Loyal to their own."
20872,"DAVOS: Tonight, the Night's Watch elect a new Lord Commander. Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win."
20873,JON: Most likely.
20874,DAVOS: Unpleasant man. He thinks you're a traitor. What's your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command?
20875,"JON: Unpleasant, I expect."
20876,STANNIS: Your bravery made him look weak. He'll punish you for it. I don't punish men for bravery. I reward them.
20877,"JON: I don't doubt it, Your Grace. But I'm a brother of the Night's Watch. I've pledged them my life, my honor, my sword. I don't know what I have left to give you."
20878,STANNIS: You can give me the North.
20879,"JON: I can't. Even if I wanted to, I'm a bastard. A Snow."
20880,"STANNIS: Kneel before me. Lay your sword at my feet. Pledge me your service and you'll rise again as Jon Stark, Lord of Winterfell."
20881,NARRATOR:Jon stares at Stannis deeply without saying a word.
20882,SAM: He'll make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen?
20883,"JON: It's the first thing I ever remember wanting. I'd daydream that my father would ask the king, and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again."
20884,SAM: You deserve this. You do. I couldn't be happier for you.
20885,JON: I'm going to refuse him.
20886,SAM (confused): But you'd be Lord of Winterfell.
20887,"JON: I swore a vow to the Night's Watch. If I don't take my own word seriously, what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be?"
20888,NARRATOR:Jon walks away from Sam and takes a seat.
20889,ALLISER (O.S.): Crowded. You'd think we were serving venison stew.
20890,NARRATOR:Maester Aemon rises slowly from the table at the front.
20891,AEMON: Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Night's Watch?
20892,NARRATOR:Janos Slynt stands up.
20893,"JANOS: Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight, he's a man of true nobility. He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack, and led us to victory against the wildlings."
20894,"MEN: Hear, hear."
20895,JANOS: He's a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life. He's the only true choice.
20896,NARRATOR:Alliser smiles. Men cheer and beat on the tables.
20897,AEMON: Is there anyone else?
20898,"SHADOW TOWER BROTHER: Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger. Through 10 winters he served. As commander of the Shadow Tower, he kept the wildlings away. We could do no better."
20899,"NARRATOR:Men, including Jon, bang their cups on the table, but the reaction is much weaker."
20900,"AEMON: If there's no one else, we will begin the voting. The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne. The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister. Each brother will--"
20901,SAM: Maester Aemon.
20902,"NARRATOR:Every Brother, including Jon, look to Sam at the back of the room in shock."
20903,AEMON: Samwell Tarly. Go on.
20904,"NARRATOR:Jon shakes his head ""no"" at Sam."
20905,JANOS (O.S.): Sam the Slayer.
20906,NARRATOR:The whole room laughs.
20907,JANOS: Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow. How's your lady love Slayer?
20908,NARRATOR:More laughs.
20909,SAM: Her name is Gilly. Brother Slynt knows her quite well. They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall.
20910,NARRATOR:The men start laughing at Janos now.
20911,JANOS: Lies!
20912,"SAM: A wildling girl, a baby, and Lord Janos. I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making."
20913,NARRATOR:Stronger laughter. Maester Aemon cracks a smile.
20914,"SAM: Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children, Jon Snow was leading."
20915,NARRATOR:The men go quiet.
20916,"SAM: Ser Alliser fought bravely, it is true. And when he was wounded, it is Jon who saved us. He took charge of the wall's defense. He killed the Magnar of the Thenns. (a man next to Sam nods) He went North to deal with Mance Rayder, knowing it almost certainly meant his own death. Before that, he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont. Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward. He saw something in Jon, and now we've all seen it, too. He may be young, but he's the commander we turned to when the night was darkest."
20917,NARRATOR:The men give Jon a strong cheer.
20918,"ALLISER: I can't argue with any of that. (stands up) But who does Jon Snow want to command? Night's Watch or the wildlings? Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times. What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stannis's army hadn't come along? We all saw him put the King-beyond-the-Wall out of his misery. Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life, or a man who makes love to them?"
20919,NARRATOR:Jon doesn't respond. Maester Aemon rises again.
20920,AEMON: It is time.
20921,"NARRATOR:Brothers of the Night's Watch walk to the front of the room, placing their tokens into a jar. A brother breaks the jar and counts the tokens. Alliser and Jon have the same amount of tokens."
20922,"BROTHER: It appears to be a tie, Maester."
20923,"NARRATOR:Maester Aemon rises once more, feels each stack of tokens to determine which is which, and casts his own vote for Jon. The men near Alliser look angry. The men grouped around Mallister are content. Everyone else cheers."
20924,BROTHERS: Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow! Jon Snow!
20925,"NARRATOR:Jon rises, sees Alliser glaring at him, and lets out a small smile for the first time since he entered the room."
20926,"NARRATOR:Arya creeps up on a pigeon in an alleyway and cuts its head off with Needle. She walks down the street with the pigeon in a pouch and Needle dangling from her hip. Three men walk by, see Needle, and approach her."
20927,MAN: You. You!
20928,NARRATOR:Arya stops and turns around to face them.
20929,MAN: What have you got there?
20930,NARRATOR:Arya doesn't respond.
20931,MAN: I said--
20932,ARYA: Turn around and go. (pulls out Needle) Turn around and go.
20933,"Man: That's a nice little sword. Worth 100 pieces, a sword like that. (pulls out his own sword)"
20934,ARYA: Nothing's worth anything to dead men.
20935,"NARRATOR:The man approaches her with his sword, but then sees the Old Man from the House of Black and White walking towards the altercation and backs off."
20936,"MEN: Quickly, go, go!"
20937,NARRATOR:They flee. The man looks at Arya then begins walking away.
20938,NARRATOR:The Old Man leads Arya back to the doorstep.
20939,ARYA: Who are you? Why were they scared of you?
20940,OLD MAN: You lost this.
20941,"NARRATOR:He tosses Arya her coin, then reaches to his face, pulls it off, and reveals the face of Jaqen H'ghar"
20942,ARYA: You said there was no Jaqen H'ghar here.
20943,JAQEN: There isn't. A man is not Jaqen H'ghar.
20944,NARRATOR:He begins to head back inside the House of Black and White.
20945,ARYA: Well who are you then?
20946,NARRATOR:He turns back around.
20947,JAQEN: No one. And that is who a girl must become.
20948,"NARRATOR:Jaqen opens the door and waits for Arya. After a moment, she follows him into the House of Black and White. The door closes behind them."
20949,NARRATOR:Mossador is let into the Son of the Harpy's cell. The guards hold him up for Mossador.
20950,"HARPY (Valyrian): She doesn't belong here. And no matter how many of your traitors call her ""Mhysa"", she will never be your mother."
20951,NARRATOR:Mossador stares at him.
20952,"NARRATOR:The Harpy is displayed in the street with his mask on, but the eye holes are cut out. A knife is in his stomach and skull, and ""Kill the Masters"" is written in blood on the wall next to the body."
20953,DAENERYS: Why?
20954,"MOSSADOR (Valyrian): For you, Mhysa. (kneels) You wanted the Harpy dead, but your hands were tied. I set you free, as you did all of us."
20955,"DAENERYS: He was our prisoner, awaiting trial. You had no right."
20956,MOSSADOR: He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt.
20957,DAENERYS: There are no more slaves. There are no more Masters.
20958,"MOSSADOR: Then who lives in the Pyramids? Who wears gold masks and murders your children? (beat) When Grey Worm came to us, I was the first to take up the knife for you. I remember the look on my father's face as I struck down his Master, who had traded his infant son for a dog. My father died in the fighting. If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains, he never lived."
20959,"DAENERYS: The Harpy's life was not yours to take. Once, the Masters were the law--"
20960,MOSADOR: --and now you are the law!
20961,DAENERYS: The law is the law. Take him.
20962,NARRATOR:Two Unsullieds carry Mossador out of the room.
20963,NARRATOR:The Unsullied escort Daenerys and her small council. A large crowd surrounds them.
20964,CROWD: Mhysa! Myhsa!
20965,"NARRATOR:They settle in front of the courthouse, surrounded by both former Masters and former slaves. The Unsullied form a ring around her."
20966,HIZDAHR (to Daario): She should have cut off the traitor's head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it.
20967,DAARIO: Which is what I keep telling her to do to you.
20968,NARRATOR:The former slaves continues to yell to their Mhysa while the masters leer at her.
20969,"DAENERYS (Valyrian, to crowd): You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice. One cannot exist without the other."
20970,NARRATOR:Mossador is carried into the scene by Unsullied and set before Daenerys on his knees.
20971,CROWD (Valyrian): Brother! Brother!
20972,"MOSSADOR (Valyrian): Mhysa, please! Forgive me!"
20973,DAENERYS (Valyrian): A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him. The punishment is death.
20974,CROWD (Valyrian): Mercy! Mercy!
20975,"NARRATOR:Mossador looks to Daenerys, pleading. She looks to Daario and nods. He takes out his arakh, walks to Mossador, and puts it to his neck. The crowd starts protesting and the Masters look on uncertainly."
20976,MOSSADOR: Mhysa... (prays in Valyrian)
20977,"NARRATOR:The crowd begs and pleads for mercy. Daenerys stares out to the crowd, then gives a nod to Daario, who swiftly decapitates Mossador."
20978,CROWD: Mhysa...
20979,"NARRATOR:The crowd goes silent. Suddenly, they start hissing at Daenerys. The Unsullied brace themselves. A former slave throws a rock at a former Master, and the Unsullied attempt to hold back the fight. Barristan and Grey Worm escort Missandei and Daenerys away from the crowd. The Unsullied cover her with their shields."
20980,NARRATOR:Former slaves and masters begin killing each other in the streets. Rocks are thrown at the Unsullied shields in attempts to hit Daenerys.
20981,"BARRISTAN: I'll stand guard outside your door tonight, Your Grace."
20982,GREY WORM: We all guard tonight.
20983,DAENERYS: Leave me.
20984,"NARRATOR:Barristan, Daario, Missandei, and Grey Worm leave the room. Daenerys hears a noise coming from outside, and goes out on her balcony to investigate."
20985,"NARRATOR:When she's out she hears a soft growl, and turns to see Drogon, perched on the top of the pyramid and close to fully grown."
20986,DAENERYS (shocked): Drogon...
20987,"NARRATOR:He slowly climbs down to her balcony. Daenerys extends her hand. Drogon sniffs it hesitantly, and then takes off into the night, soaring over Meereen."

Behind a large heart surrounded by gold flames, a glowing fire can be seen. A statue of a knight is shown, then a statue of a king’s face. A statue of a contorted tree is covered in a hair-like substance. There is a large pit filled with liquid in the center of the room. Arya can be heard, and then seen, sweeping. The waif carries a bucket past her. Sitting on the edge of the pit, Jaqen whisper to a man. Arya looks up and watches as Jaqen scoops up a cup of liquid from the pit, and hands it to the man. The man looks up at Jaqen, and hesitates before taking it."
20992,MAN: Valar morghulis.
20993,JAQEN: Valar dohaeris.
20994,"NARRATOR:The man drinks the liquid, and watches as he approaches the statue of the woman with her eyes closed. He kneels down in front of it. Arya puts her broom down and approaches Jaqen."
20995,ARYA: I've been sweeping this floor for days.
20996,JAQEN: Good.
20997,ARYA: I didn't come here to sweep floors.
20998,"JAQEN: No? Why come, then?"
20999,ARYA: You said that I could be your apprentice. You said you'd teach me how to a Faceless Man.
21000,"JAQEN: A man teaches a girl. (Stands up). Valar dohaeris. All men must serve. Faceless men, most of all. (Walks away)."
21001,ARYA: I want to serve. (Jaqen stops).
21002,"JAQEN: A girl wants to serve herself. Here we serve the Many-Faced God, to serve well. A girl must become no-one."
21003,ARYA: Which one is the Many-Faced God? I see the Stranger. I see the Drowned God. I see the Weirwood Face.
21004,JAQEN: There is only one god. A girl knows his name. And all men know his gift.
21005,"NARRATOR:Jaqen leaves. Arya looks down at the man who had been kneeling. He is lying on his back, dead. Two men come into the room with a stretcher. They places the man’s body on it and begin walking to an open door at the end of the room. The waif walks past Arya."
21006,ARYA: Where are they taking him?
21007,"NARRATOR:The waif doesn’t respond, but continues walking. Arya turns to watch as the door closes behind the men carrying the stretcher."

21016,NARRATOR:Tommen breathes heavily as he and Margaery finish having sex. She turns onto her side and smiles.
21017,TOMMEN: Did I hurt you?
21018,MARGAERY: No. You were lovely.
21019,TOMMEN: It all happened so fast.
21020,MARGAERY: Yes. (Chuckles).
21021,"TOMMEN: I was scared maybe I hurt you, it sounded"
21022,"MARGAERY: No, no, no. You're very sweet. The sweetest king who ever lived."
21023,"TOMMEN: This is what I want to do all day, every day for the rest of my life."
21024,"MARGAERY: Wouldn't that be glorious? (They laugh. Tommen leans in to kiss her). Shouldn't we rest a little while? Just to catch our breath, there's no rush, is there?"
21025,TOMMEN: Of course not. Are you hungry? Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice?
21026,"MARGAERY: No, I'm fine. I just want you all to myself. I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name."
21027,TOMMEN: King Tommen. It still sounds strange to me. Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you?
21028,MARGAERY: So strange… Husband.
21029,"TOMMEN: Wife. (They laugh). Sometimes it feels odd. I'm the king, I've married the most beautiful woman in the world, (She chuckles), and it's all because my brother died."
21030,"MARGAERY: I understand. But it's not your fault, you know that, don't you? You mustn't feel guilty."
21031,TOMMEN: I don't feel guilty. That's what's odd.
21032,NARRATOR:Margaery looks at him curiously. He suddenly sits up.
21033,TOMMEN: Do you like to sail?
21034,MARGAERY: (Sits up). I love to sail.
21035,"TOMMEN: I do, too."
21036,"MARGAERY: I think we're going to be very happy, you and I."
21037,"TOMMEN: I do, too."
21038,"NARRATOR:She kisses him and turns around. She gets up, wrapping a bedsheet around herself as a cover."
21039,"MARGAERY: Living in a tower so high, it touches the clouds. Of course my grandmother couldn't wait to go home. The capital is not for everyone, I suppose. Does your mother like it here?"
21040,TOMMEN: I don't think so. She told me never to trust anyone in King's Landing.
21041,MARGAERY: It's so wonderful to have her watching over you. A lioness guiding her cub. (Pours them some wine).
21042,"TOMMEN: Well, but I'm a man now."
21043,MARGAERY: You are. And the king. (Hands him win). But you'll always be her baby-boy.
21044,TOMMEN: I suppose.
21045,"MARGAERY: I adore how she has always been so generous with me, so kind. And the horror she's had to injure. (Sits down and begins to comb her hair). Losing her husband, her eldest child and her father. It's no wonder she's so protective of you. She'll never let you out of her sight."

21047,"NARRATOR:Cersei and Tommen walk together, her arm around his. A group of guards walk behind them."
21048,"CERSEI: You look very much in love. The first days of marriage are often so blissful. She's certainly very pretty, isn't she? Like a doll, she smiles quite a lot. Do you think she's intelligent? I can't quite tell. Not that it matters."
21049,TOMMEN: Do you ever miss Casterly Rock?
21050,CERSEI: There's nothing for me in Casterly Rock.
21051,TOMMEN: That's where you grew up. (They stop). You always told me that you liked the people there better. You said that King's Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk.
21052,CERSEI: (Chuckles). Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock?
21053,"TOMMEN: The way that you talked about it, I always thought that you missed it. That you... That it was your real home."
21054,CERSEI: This is my real home now. Where my family lives.
21055,"TOMMEN: I want you to be happy, mother."
21056,"CERSEI: I know that. I know you do, my sweet boy."
21057,TOMMEN: But wouldn't you be happier in Casterly Rock?

21059,"NARRATOR:Cersei approaches a room with two guards. Inside, Margaery is having tea with some of her friends."
21060,"MARGAERY: I said, ""Darling, surely 4 times is enough, are you trying to set a new record?"" (Laugher). And he said, ""Well, what is the record? I'm sure we can break it."""
21061,"NARRATOR:Margaery’s friends laugh. As Cersei walks in, they all get up and bow."
21062,MARGAERY: Mother! (Gets up and hugs Cersei). Welcome.
21063,CERSEI: Don't you look lovely. Marriage agrees with you.
21064,MARGAERY: Can we bring you anything to eat or drink? I wish we had some wine for you. It's a bit early in the day for us.
21065,"CERSEI: No, no. I, I can't stay. I just wanted to let you know if, there is ever anything I can do for you."
21066,MARGAERY: You are very sweet.
21067,CERSEI: Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen.
21068,MARGAERY: I absolutely adore him. You raised a gallant young man. I'm forever grateful.
21069,CERSEI: Good. Good. I'm glad to hear you're happy.
21070,"MARGAERY: Ecstatic. I really am. Exhausted, to be honest, but what can I expect, he is half lion, half stag. (Margaery’s friends laugh)."
21071,CERSEI: I'll leave you to it then. (Turns to leave).
21072,"MARGAERY: Oh, forgive me, I haven't been at Court for long, I get so confused. What's the proper way to address you now? Queen Mother or Dowager Queen?"
21073,CERSEI: There's no need for such formalities.
21074,"MARGAERY: In any event, judging from the King's enthusiasm, the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon."
21075,CERSEI: Won’t that be a lovely day.
21076,MARGAERY: Can you imagine the celebrations? They'll ring the bells all day and night.
21077,CERSEI: Remember. Anything you need.
21078,"NARRATOR:Margaery smiles. Cersei leaves. Margaery’s smile fades. It returns when her friends begin laughing, and she turns back around. Cersei walks away with her two guards, still able to hear the laughter."

21081,"NARRATOR:A horse whinnies. Bolton bannermen ride to the keep. In the keep, a number of workmen are busy building and repairing things. Some men carry some raven cages through the middle of the courtyard. Theon, carrying a dead bird, walks through for a moment. He then comes across some soldiers lifting up some flayed bodies with rope. He becomes very tense and forces himself to keep walking, head down. A raven picks at a body in a cart."
21082,NARRATOR:INT. DINING HALL
21083,NARRATOR:Roose and Ramsay sit at a table as Theon cuts some food. Ramsay talks with his face stuffed.
21084,ROOSE: We can't hold the North with terror alone.
21085,RAMSAY: You can't hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us.
21086,"ROOSE: I sent you there to collect taxes, not bodies."
21087,"RAMSAY: Lord Cerwyn refused to pay. Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark, and he'd be damned if he kissed a traitor's boot."
21088,NARRATOR:Theon holds the food in front of Ramsay. He takes some of it and puts it on his plate.
21089,ROOSE: He left you no choice.
21090,"RAMSAY: I flayed him living, along with his wife and brother. Made his son watch."
21091,ROOSE: And?
21092,RAMSAY: The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes.
21093,ROOSE: (After a moment). I have something important to tell you. Stop eating and listen.
21094,"NARRATOR:Ramsay, who had been heavily engrossed in his eating, stops suddenly and looks up. Theon slowly puts down a plate nearby. Ramsay puts down his silverware and sits back, looking at his father."
21095,ROOSE: We don't have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us. Do you understand that?
21096,RAMSAY: Our pact with the Lannisters protects -
21097,"ROOSE: I had a pact with Tywin Lannister, and Tywin Lannister is dead. The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact. They've never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north. If you think they will for us, you're a fool. We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses, and parleying those alliances into greater power. The best way to forge a lasting alliance isn't by peeling a man's skin off. The best way is marriage. (Stands up). Now that you're a Bolton by royal decree, it's time you married a suitable bride. And as it happens, I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North."

21101,SANSA: That's Moat Cailin.
21102,"BAELISH: Yes. A bit shabby, isn't it? You've been here before."
21103,"SANSA: On our way down to King's Landing, with my father and Arya and… where are you taking me?"
21104,BAELISH: Home.
21105,"SANSA: The Boltons have Winterfell. (He nods). The marriage proposal, it wasn't for you?"
21106,BAELISH: (Shakes his head). No.
21107,SANSA: Roose Bolton murdered my brother. He betrayed my family!
21108,BAELISH: He did.
21109,SANSA: He serves the Lannisters.
21110,BAELISH: For now.
21111,SANSA: I won't go.
21112,BAELISH: Winterfell is your home.
21113,SANSA: Not anymore.
21114,BAELISH: Always. You're a Stark. Dyeing your hair doesn't change that. You're Sansa Stark. The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark. Your place is in the North.
21115,SANSA: I can't marry him. You can't make me. He's a traitor. A murderer.
21116,"BAELISH: You're not marrying Roose Bolton. No, you'll be marrying his son and heir, Ramsay. One day he'll be Warden of the North and you will -"
21117,SANSA: No!
21118,BAELISH: Sansa -
21119,"SANSA: No, you can't make me. I will starve myself. I will die before I have to go there."
21120,"BAELISH: (Grabbing her). I won't force you to do anything. Don't you know by now how much I care for you? Say the word and we turn the horses round, but listen to me. Listen. (Quietly). You've been running all your life. Terrible things happened to your family and you weep. You sit alone in a darkened room, mourning their fates. You've been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father. Stop being a bystander, do you hear me? Stop running. There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it. You loved your family. Avenge them."
21121,"NARRATOR:He kisses her forehead. He walks back to their horses. After a few moments, she regains her composure and gets on her horse. The party starts moving again. On top of a large hill nearby, Brienne and Podrick watch as the party arrives at the keep."
21122,PODRICK: How do we get through there?
21123,BRIENNE: We don't. We go around. (She turns her horse and begins leaving).
21124,PODRICK: It sets miles out of the way. We'll lose sight of them.
21125,BRIENNE: Doesn't matter. I know where they're going.

21127,NARRATOR:Podrick sits scrubbing a boot.
21128,BRIENNE: Aren't you getting a bit old to be a squire? How did you end up squiring for the Imp?
21129,PODRICK: He hates that nickname.
21130,"BRIENNE: Well, he's not here to complain about it, is he?"
21131,NARRATOR:Podrick finishes scrubbing and hands the boot to Brienne. He puts the brush down. Brienne begins putting the boot on.
21132,"PODRICK: I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings. One night, he had a bit too much to drink. And he was famished, so he borrowed a ham."
21133,BRIENNE: He borrowed it?
21134,"PODRICK: He wasn't a thief. He was drunk and hungry and he wasn't thinking. I was drunk too. He gave me half the ham. Next morning, one of the guards saw him passed out, under a wagon, with the ham bone still in his hand. They hanged the man afternoon. They tied the noose for me too, but, Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne. So he pardoned me, and sent me to King's Landing to squire for his son."
21135,BRIENNE: As punishment. For both of you.
21136,PODRICK: It didn't seem that way. Lord Tyrion was always very good to me.
21137,"BRIENNE: (Walks away to get firewood). Yes, all of your lords were very kind to you. All except me. Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person."
21138,PODRICK: I'm not sorry. You're the best fighter I've ever seen. You beat The Hound. I'm proud to be your squire.
21139,BRIENNE: I'm sorry I'm always snapping at you.
21140,PODRICK: If you wouldn't snap at me I wouldn't learn anything.
21141,"BRIENNE: You want to be a knight, Pod?"
21142,PODRICK: Yes.
21143,"BRIENNE: Starting tomorrow, we'll train with the sword twice a day, before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening. (Sits down). And I'm going to show you how to ride properly."
21144,PODRICK: Thank you.
21145,"BRIENNE: I can't knight you, but I can teach you how to fight."
21146,PODRICK: I suppose that's more important.
21147,"NARRATOR:Podrick leans over the campfire with some rocks. He strikes them together until he gets a spark, and blows until the fire starts going. He wipes himself off and stands up, walking over to Brienne. He begins taking her armor off."
21148,"PODRICK: You weren't a knight, but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon, weren't you?"
21149,BRIENNE: I was.
21150,PODRICK: Lord Tyrion said he was a good man.
21151,BRIENNE: He was.
21152,PODRICK: But how did you end up serving Renly?
21153,"BRIENNE: (After a few moments). When I was a girl, my father held a ball. I'm his only living child, so he wants to make a good match for me. He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth. I didn't want to go, but he dragged me to the ballroom. (Pauses). And it was wonderful. None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was. The shoved each other, and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance. And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles. (Smiles). My father smiled at me and I smiled at him. I'd never been so happy. (Her smile drops). Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering. And then they all started to laugh, they couldn't keep the game going any longer. They were toying with me. ‘Brienne the Beauty’, they called me. Great joke. And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive. A great lumbering beast. I tried to run away, but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms. “Don't let them see your tears,” he told me. “They’re nasty little shits. The nasty little shits aren't worth crying over.” He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word. And he was the king's brother after all."
21154,PODRICK: But wasn't he... Lord Tyrion said he was...
21155,"BRIENNE: Yes, Pod, he liked men, I'm not an idiot. He didn't love me, he didn't want me, he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldn't see me hurt. He saved me from being a joke. From that day until his last day. And I couldn't save him in return. Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love. One day, I will avenge King Renly."
21156,PODRICK: But you said a shadow murdered him. How do you fight a shadow?
21157,"BRIENNE: A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon. I know it was Stannis. I know it in my heart. Stannis is a man, not a shadow. And a man can be killed."

21163,STANNIS: (To Olly as he closes the door). I'd like to speak alone.
21164,"JON: Olly is my steward now, as I was Lord Commander Mormont's. I want him to attend my meetings, to learn from men with experience. One day, he might command."
21165,STANNIS: Very well. (They all sit down). Have you considered my offer?
21166,JON: I have. And I thank you for it. You do me great honor. All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark.
21167,STANNIS: Say the word and you will be.
21168,JON: But I have to refuse you. I'm Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. My place is here.
21169,STANNIS: I'm giving you a chance to avenge your family. To take back the castle where you grew up. To rule the North.
21170,"JON: I wish I could fight beside you. Believe me, I do. But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood. I pledged my life to the Night's Watch."
21171,STANNIS: You're as stubborn as your father. And as honorable.
21172,JON: I can imagine no higher praise.
21173,"STANNIS: I didn't mean it as praise. Honor got your father killed. (Stands up). But if your mind’s made up, I won't try to persuade you."
21174,"JON: May I ask, Your Grace, how long you plan to stay at Castle Black?"
21175,STANNIS: Are you bored of us already?
21176,JON: You saved us from Mance Rayder's army. We will never forget that. But it's a question of survival. The Night's Watch can't continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely. Winter is coming.
21177,STANNIS: I know it. We march on Winterfell within the fortnight. Before the snows trap us here.
21178,JON: And the wildlings?
21179,"STANNIS: They'd rather burn than fight for me, so be it. I leave their fate to you. You could execute them, that's the safest course. (After a moment). Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was. I assume the brothers of the Night's Watch would rather see the wildlings dead."
21180,"JON: Most of the brothers, yes. There's little love for the free folk here. (Olly stares at him)."
21181,STANNIS: You're the Lord Commander. Your decision.
21182,NARRATOR:Stannis begins to leave. Olly opens the door.
21183,STANNIS: You have many enemies in Castle Black. Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere? Give him command of  Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
21184,JON: I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.
21185,STANNIS: Whoever said that didn't have many enemies.

21187,"DAVOS: He sees something in you. (Jon looks up). Might not be apparent from his tone, but it's the truth. He believes in you."
21188,JON: I'm sorry I disappointed him.
21189,NARRATOR:Davos walks forward and takes a seat. Olly closes the door again.
21190,DAVOS: The king is a complicated man. But he wants what's right for the Seven Kingdoms.
21191,JON: As long as he's ruling them.
21192,DAVOS: He's the one true king. He has the blood right to that throne.
21193,JON: I’ve sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms.
21194,DAVOS: Have you now? (Turning to Olly). How does the Night's Watch vow go again? I bet you've got it memorized since you got here.
21195,"NARRATOR:Olly looks to Jon. Jon looks at him, crosses his arms, and nods."
21196,OLLY: Night gathers and now my watch begins -
21197,"DAVOS: Not that bit, the bit at the end."
21198,"OLLY: I'm the sword in the darkness, the watcher on the walls, the shield that guards the realm of men. I pledge my life -"
21199,"DAVOS: Wait, that's enough. “The shield that guards the realm of men.” That's what you swore to be. Now I'm not a learned man, but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world. It just might mean wading in the muck, getting your boots dirty, and doing what needs to be doing."
21200,JON: And what needs to be done?
21201,"DAVOS: As long as the Boltons rule the North, (Stands up), the North will suffer. Just one man's opinion."

She ties them up and drops them into the water, the rock causing them to sink. She picks up her coin purse and throws it in the water. After a moment of examining her original coin in her hand, she throws it in the water as well. She looks at her sword Needle for a moment, and then picks it up. She prepares to throw it in the sea, but finds herself unable to, and begins to sob. She turns and walks over to some nearby rocks, and hides the sword under some of them."

However, after a moment, she realizes that she didn’t hear the door close, and she looks up to find it wide open. Jaqen surprises her by suddenly putting his hand on her shoulder. He nods towards the door, and begins walking over to it. Arya follows him, leaving the broom outside. They go down a fire-lit tunnel. Jaqen opens the door at the end of the tunnel to reveal a chamber. Inside, the waif stands motionless next to a large stone slab. On it is the dead man. Jaqen leaves through the back door. After Jaqen closes the door, the waif begins to remove the dead man’s clothes. She looks up at Arya, who walks over and begins to do so as well. The waif inspects his body. She wets a rag and begins cleaning off the man."
21231,ARYA: What do we do with them after we wash them?

21254,SAM: He apologizes for not being here. He's not feeling well.
21255,"JON: Take good care of him. (To the group). Brothers. As you all know too well, it's long past time to dig a new latrine pit. (Laughter. Jon looks at Alliser). First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task. (Laughter. After a moment, he continues). Brian. Seems like a good job for a ginger."
21256,"NARRATOR:Everyone laughs. Some of the men jokingly pat Brian on his back, and Brian laughs as well."

Alliser stands in his way for a moment. Jon looks at the confrontation, worried. Alliser raises his eyebrows for a moment and moves out of the way. Janos looks at him shocked. Edd grabs Janos, and some other men assist in dragging him outside."

21279,"JON: If you have any last words, my Lord, now is the time."
21280,"JANOS: (Trembling). I was wrong. You're the Lord Commander! We all serve you. I'm sorry. Not only for this, for all I've done and said. I was wrong! (Jon brings his sword up). My Lord, please, mercy! Mercy! I'll go! I will! Please. I'm afraid. I've always been afraid."

21309,"HIGH SEPTON: As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world. An insult to me is an insult to the Gods. An assault on my person, is an assault on our very religion."

21311,"HIGH SEPTON: I was, by those fanatics who call themselves ‘sparrows’. They humiliated me, they they beat me, they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones. I am lucky to be alive."
21312,QYBURN: I heard this all began in Littlefinger's brothel.

(Prepares soup for the next person in line). The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesn't sit well with some, so they belittle me."
21333,WOMAN 2: Seven blessings to you.
21334,"HIGH SPARROW: Seven blessings to you, my dear. It's only a name, quite an easy burden to wear. Far easier than hers. (Prepares soup for the next person in line)."
21335,CERSEI: Why no shoes?
21336,HIGH SPARROW: Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more. We all do that. It stops us from forgetting what we really are.
21337,CERSEI: Is that why you came to King's Landing? To remind everyone?
21338,"HIGH SPARROW: Everyone? I have a hard enough job reminding myself. Oh, I tell them no one's special. And they think I'm special for telling them so."
21339,CERSEI: (Smiles). Perhaps they're right.
21340,"HIGH SPARROW: It would be comforting to believe that, wouldn't it? The Gods sent you here to tempt me? I hope not. I had assumed you'd only come here to arrest me. For that incident with the High Septon."
21341,"CERSEI: An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world, wouldn't you say?"
21342,"HIGH SPARROW: Hypocrisy is a boil. Lancing a is never pleasant. Although, they could have been more careful with the blade."
21343,"CERSEI: The High Septon came to speak to me today. He doesn't want me to arrest you, he wants me to execute you."
21344,HIGH SPARROW: I wouldn't presume to know your thoughts on the matter.
21345,"CERSEI: (After a moment). My thoughts on the matter align with your own. The High Septon's behaviour was corrosive, as was his attitude. Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside. So now he resides in the Red Keep's dungeons instead. (The High Sparrow looks up at her surprised).

21374,"BAELISH: The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did. Tywin is dead. He kept his house in power through sheer will. Without him, Jaime has one hand and no allies, Tommen is a soft boy, not a king to fear."

21378,"BAELISH: A message for me, you say. Strange that the seal is broken."
21379,"ROOSE: I'm sure you understand my position, Lord Baelish. If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother, it does make me question our new alliance. The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros. Yet, here you are in the North, undermining them. Why gamble with your position?"
21380,BAELISH: Every ambitious move is a gamble. You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Stark's heart. It appears that your gamble paid off. You're Warden of the North.
21381,ROOSE: I had Tywin Lannister backing. Who supports me now? You?
21382,"BAELISH: The Eyrie is mine. The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North, they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known. I'd like to borrow one of your birds. Cersei will expect a reply."

Looking around, he drags the man out of the water, and throws two coins on him. Jorah walks over to where he has Tyrion tied up. Tyrion is grunting, trying to cut the ropes binding him with a knife. Jorah picks up the knife and Tyrion. He throws Tyrion and his supplies into the boat, and then pushes it out to sea. Once it gains momentum, he hops in himself."

21475,NARRATOR:A number of men walk around doing various tasks on deck. Jaime Lannister looks out from the side of the boat. He turns to the captain.

21479,NARRATOR:A knife hits a sandbag.
21480,BRONN: Why are we on a merchant ship? Why no Lannister sails?
21481,"JAIME: This ship's sailing to Oldtown. We'll get off earlier, not far from Sunspear. Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night."
21482,BRONN: You ever been to Dorne?
21483,JAIME: No.
21484,BRONN: I have. The Dornish are crazy. All they want to do is fight and fuck. Fuck and fight.
21485,JAIME: You should be happy to go back. (Drinks some water).
21486,"BRONN: (Gets up, walking to his knife). There's nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking. (Pulls out his knife from the sandbag). And there's nothing like a fuck-mad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight. It's how the two work together. And we're gonna do a lot of fighting, I am sure. Well, I am. But I don't imagine we'll get to stick around for the rest. Not after we've kidnapped their princess."
21487,"JAIME: We are not kidnapping their princess. We are rescuing my niece, bringing her back to the family,"
21488,BRONN: (Incredulously) Your niece?
21489,"NARRATOR:Jaime and Bronn have a stare-off. After a moment, Jaime looks away. Bronn drinks some water."
21490,BRONN: I've been doing this sort of thing a long time. I'm good at it. (Sits down).
21491,JAIME: That's why you're here.
21492,"BRONN: I know. Why are you here? Why not send 40 of me, or an army? Unlike most folks, you actually got one."
21493,JAIME: Because I don't want to start a war.
21494,BRONN: That still doesn't explain why you're doing it.
21495,JAIME: It has to be me.
21496,"BRONN: (Gets up starts walking). If I'm putting something of a lit together, a one-handed man, (Grabs some rope and walks back), who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros, is not -"
21497,JAIME: It has to be me.
21498,"BRONN: (Sheaths his sword). You set your brother free, didn't you? I bet your sister didn't like that."
21499,JAIME: (Quietly) Varys set him free.
21500,"BRONN: Well, if you ever see the little fucker, (Lays down), give him my regards."

21505,MACE: The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crown's debts. Given the expense of rebuilding the royal -
21506,CERSEI: How much can the Crown afford?
21507,"MACE: With winter coming, half what they ask. Less."
21508,CERSEI: You're the Master of Coin. How do we pay them?
21509,"MACE: Well, House Tyrell could front the gold, and the the Crown will pay us back in time, or I'll have words with my daughter."
21510,"NARRATOR:Mace smiles, as if expecting a laugh. Qyburn and Pycelle both look down. Mace’s smile fades. Cersei smiles."
21511,"CERSEI: You've already given us too much. (Gets up and walks to a window). No, we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank."
21512,MACE: Absolutely.
21513,CERSEI: In person.
21514,"MACE: (After a moment, looks at her surprised). Me? (Qyburn smiles)."
21515,"CERSEI: We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank, someone of importance, to show these bankers our respect. As the King's Master of Coin, I can think of no one more qualified."
21516,"MACE: I will be honored, Your Grace."
21517,CERSEI: The King has expressed concern about his father-in-law's safety on this voyage. (Smiling). He's ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort.
21518,"NARRATOR:Ser Meryn walks into the room. Mace turns to look at him, and then back at Cersei."
21519,MACE: My very own Kingsguard? Please express -
21520,"CERSEI: Safe travels, Lord Tyrell."
21521,"MACE: (Raises his hands). Of course, of course, (Gathers his belongings, and then gets up). I'll give your regards to the Titan of Braavos."
21522,"NARRATOR:Mace laughs. Qyburn looks down, lightly chuckling. Mace exits, followed by Ser Meryn."
21523,PYCELLE: The Small Council grows smaller and smaller.

21528,"CERSEI: May I offer you some wine, Your Holiness?"
21529,HIGH SPARROW: No. (Smiles).
21530,"NARRATOR:Cersei looks unsure, presumably having expected him to say yes. After a moment she smiles and pushes the wine away."
21531,CERSEI: The old High Septon would have asked the vintage. (Smiles).
21532,"HIGH SPARROW: I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure. But the truth is, (Chuckles), I don't like the taste."
21533,CERSEI: Hmm.
21534,HIGH SPARROW: (After a moment). How may I serve?
21535,CERSEI: All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned. Silent sisters raped. Bodies of holy men piled in the streets.
21536,"HIGH SPARROW: Wars teach people to obey the sword, not the Gods."
21537,"CERSEI: Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own. (HS raises an eyebrow). In the days before the Targaryens, the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven."
21538,"HIGH SPARROW: Well, the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago."
21539,"CERSEI: If I explain the holy purpose to my son, the king, I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy."
21540,HIGH SPARROW: An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people.
21541,"CERSEI: An army and service to the Gods themselves. And to you, of course. As the chosen representative of the Seven."
21542,"HIGH SPARROW: An honor I never expected. Or indeed, ever wished for."
21543,"CERSEI: Which is why you were chosen. (HS smiles). You and I both know how the world works. Too often the wicked are the wealthiest, beyond the reach of justice. The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most."
21544,HIGH SPARROW: All sinners are equal before the Gods.
21545,CERSEI: (Smiles. Continues after a moment). What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst? Shielded by gold and privilege.
21546,HIGH SPARROW: May the Father judge him justly. (Smiles).

They begin beating some of the participants, and taking others out of the room. Olyvar attempts to confront a member of the Faith Militant as the man drags out a prostitute."
21559,OLYVAR: (Angrily). This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.
21560,"NARRATOR:The man elbows Olyvar in the face and continues on his way. After most of the Faith’s Militant are gone, Olyvar hears a scream. He walks towards the source of the scream, blood running from his noise, and hears another scream."
21561,MILITANT: Cocksucker! (Man screams). Boy fucker! You barbaric filth! There's a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind.
21562,"NARRATOR:Olyvar stands just outside the doorway of a large room. Inside, a group of militants, most of them armed, stand around a male prostitute and his male client. Both are naked and bloody on the floor."

21579,"TOMMEN: I, I don't know. I, I didn't order it."
21580,MARGAERY: We both know who did. (Walks away). You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock.
21581,TOMMEN: (Standing up). Are you saying my mother is behind this?
21582,MARGAERY: She's jealous you're not hers anymore. Arresting my brother is her revenge.
21583,TOMMEN: Aren't you and mother getting along?
21584,"MARGAERY: (Scoffs). Oh, my sweet, sweet King. (Sits down). Do you have any affection for me at all?"

21593,"TOMMEN: Well, no... But you armed the Faith Militant. You gave the High Sparrow an army."
21594,"CERSEI: I did. And your wife has every right to criticize. (Begins walking towards her desk). Can't allow fanatics to arrest the Queen's brother, no matter his perversions."
21595,TOMMEN: Then can I tell Margaery you'll have Ser Loras released?
21596,"CERSEI: I told you I am not holding Ser Loras. You're the King. I'm sure if you speak to the High Sparrow, he'll release the poor boy."

21633,STANNIS: Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.
21634,SELYSE: A bastard by some tavern slut.
21635,"STANNIS: Perhaps, but that wasn't Ned Stark's way."
21636,SELYSE: I should have given you a son.
21637,STANNIS: Not your fault.
21638,SELYSE: Whose then? (Looks at their daughter Shireen). I gave you nothing but weakness. (Turns back). And deformity. (Stannis shakes his head).
21639,MELISANDRE: (Walking towards them). Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light.

21641,MELISANDRE: Her father is the Lord's chosen King. And her father's blood runs through her veins.

21661,JON: He murdered my brother.

21667,JON: How can I help you?
21668,"MELISANDRE: Come with us when we ride south. (Walks forwards). None of us know the castle as well as you do. Its hidden tunnels, its weaknesses, its people. Winterfell was your home once. Don't you want to chase the rats out of it? (Turns to Jon)."
21669,JON: Castle Black is my home now. Night's Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms.
21670,MELISANDRE: There's only one war. Life against death. Come. Let me show what you're fighting for. (Walks in front of Jon).
21671,"JON: You're gonna show me some vision in the fire. Forgive me, my Lady. But I don't trust in visions."

21676,"MELISANDRE: The Lord of Light made us male and female. Two parts of a greater whole. We are joining this power. Power to make life, power to make light, and power to cast shadows."
21677,JON: I don't think Stannis would like that very much.
21678,MELISANDRE: Then we shouldn't tell him. (Starts unbuttoning Jon’s coat).
21679,JON: I can't.
21680,MELISANDRE: Why?
21681,JON: I swore a vow. (Melisandre looks at him incredulously). I loved another.
21682,MELISANDRE: The dead don't need lovers. Only the living.
21683,"NARRATOR:Jon keeps her from unbuttoning his coat any further, breathing heavily."
21684,JON: I know. But I still love her.

21690,STANNIS: Are you lonely?
21691,"SHIREEN: (Turns around, holding something). Just bored."
21692,STANNIS: My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources.
21693,"SHIREEN: (Looks up). Were you bored a lot, too?"
21694,"STANNIS: I know Castle Black is no place for a child, but I -"
21695,SHIREEN: I like it. (Walks to a table). I thought I'd be left at home. I know mother didn't want to bring me. (Picks up an X from the table).
21696,STANNIS: Why do you say that?
21697,"SHIREEN: She told me, ""I don't want to bring you."""

21701,"SHIREEN: Are you ashamed of me, father?"
21702,NARRATOR:Stannis looks up surprised. He puts down what he was doing. Shireen looks down.
21703,"STANNIS: When you were an infant, (Stands up and walks around his desk), the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone. His goods were junk except for one wooden doll. He'd even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House. No doubt he'd heard of your birth, and assumed new fathers were easy targets. I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle, (Shireen smiles), and you pressed it to your cheek. (Looks down. Shireen’s smile drops). By the time we burnt the doll, it was too late. (Walks to the table and adjusts the objects on it). I was told you would die. Or worse, the grayscale would go slow. (Turns to her). Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you. Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men, before the sickness spread to the castle. I told them all to go to hell. (Shireen smiles). I called in every maester on this side of the world. Every healer, every apothecary. They stopped the disease and saved your life. Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men. (Walks towards her). You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon. And you are my daughter."

21708,BAELISH: I thought I might find you here. (Sansa turns to him). Your Aunt Lyanna.
21709,"SANSA: Father never talked about her. Sometimes I'd find him down here, lighting the candles. They say she was beautiful."
21710,"BAELISH: I saw her once. I was a boy, living with your mother's family. Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal. Everyone was there. The Mad King, your father, Robert Baratheon. And Lyanna, she was already promised to Robert. You can imagine what it was like for me, a boy from nowhere, with nothing to his name, watching these legendary men, tilting at the lists. The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen. When Rhaegar won, everyone cheered for the prince. I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair. How handsome he was. Until he rode right past his wife, Elia Martell, and all the smiles died. I've never seen so many people so quiet. He rode past his wife, and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyanna's lap. Blue as frost. How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt?"
21711,"SANSA: Yes, he chose her… and then he kidnapped her and raped her."
21712,BAELISH: Come. (Takes her arm). Let's speak somewhere the dead can't hear us. (They begin walking away).
21713,SANSA: Dressed for riding?
21714,BAELISH: I am.
21715,SANSA: Where are you going?
21716,BAELISH: King's Landing.
21717,SANSA: King's Landing?
21718,BAELISH: Cersei sent for me. (They stop). We must not let her sniff out any trouble.
21719,SANSA: You can't leave me here!
21720,"BAELISH: I know how hard it is to live with people you despise, believe me. But it won't be for long."
21721,SANSA: How do you know?
21722,"BAELISH: (They begin walking again). Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black. He'll march south to King's Landing before the winter snows block his way. But first, he has to take Winterfell."
21723,SANSA: You don't know that.
21724,"BAELISH: I do. Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons he'll rally your father's bannermen to his cause. With the North behind him, Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne."
21725,SANSA: You think he'll defeat the Boltons?
21726,"BAELISH: He has a larger army. He's the finest military commander in Westeros. A betting man would put his money on Stannis. (They stop). As it happens, I am a betting man."
21727,SANSA: And if you're right?
21728,"BAELISH: Stannis takes Winterfell, he rescues you from the most despised family in the North. Grateful for your late father's courageous support for his claim, he names you Wardeness of the North."
21729,"SANSA: But I, I wouldn't… Wardeness of the North"
21730,BAELISH: You are the last surviving Stark. He needs you.
21731,"SANSA: What if you're wrong? What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell, or he does and the Boltons defeat him?"
21732,"BAELISH: Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours."
21733,SANSA: I don't know how to do that.
21734,BAELISH: Of course you do. He's already fallen for you.
21735,SANSA: His father frightens me.
21736,"BAELISH: He should, he's a dangerous man. But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered. And you’ve learnt to maneuver from the very best. (Puts a hand on her shoulder). I return before too long. (Puts a hand behind her head). You'll be strong without me. (She nods, and he kisses her). The North will be yours. Do you believe me?"
21737,SANSA: I expect I'll be a married woman by the time you return.
21738,NARRATOR:Baelish chuckles and pats her shoulder. He turns and leaves as Sansa watches him.
21739,CUT TO: DORNE
21740,NARRATOR:EXT. BOAT
21741,"NARRATOR:At night, Bronn and Jaime sit in a boat. Bronn rows to shore alone. Looking across at Jaime, Jaime holds up his fake hand. Bronn begrudgingly goes back to rowing alone. After they get to shore, they carry their boat in, and hide it in some tall grass. They then both walk away."
21742,NARRATOR:Jaime awakens to find Bronn standing over him with a knife. His eyes widens and he moves to the side as Bronn brings his knife down on a snake that was about to bite Jaime. Jaime looks at the snake and Bronn pulls his knife out of it.
21743,BRONN: Breakfast.
21744,NARRATOR:Bronn and Jaime sit at a fire. Bronn cooks the snake while Jaime puts gloves on.
21745,BRONN: That would have been a shit way to die.
21746,"JAIME: As far as I've seen, they're all shit ways to die."
21747,BRONN: Aye. But your lot like to give the singers a good ending.
21748,JAIME: I don't care what's sung about me when I'm dead.
21749,"BRONN: No? Two knights, off to rescue a princess. Sounds like a good song to me."
21750,JAIME: Sounds like all the rest.
21751,"NARRATOR:While Bronn is distracted eating, Jaime gets rid of his food."
21752,JAIME: What about you? What shit way would you choose?
21753,"BRONN: In my own keep, drinking my own wine, watching my sons grovel for my fortune."
21754,JAIME: How disappointing. I thought you'd have something more exciting planned.
21755,BRONN: I've had an exciting life. I want my death to be boring. How do you want to go?
21756,JAIME: In the arms of the woman I love.
21757,BRONN: She want the same thing?
21758,JAIME: Let's go.
21759,NARRATOR:They both get up and gather their things. Bronn stomps out the fire. The scene cuts to them walking through some tall grass later.
21760,"BRONN: The captain to that ship… What was he, Braavosi?"
21761,JAIME: Pentoshi.
21762,BRONN: And he's headed to Oldtown?
21763,JAIME: As I said. Why?
21764,BRONN: What's to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannister's in Dorne?
21765,JAIME: A bag of gold.
21766,BRONN: I'm not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world.
21767,JAIME: It was a heavy bag.
21768,BRONN: And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it. But you won't be around if he breaks them.
21769,NARRATOR:A horse neighs in the distance. Jaime looks around. A group of Dornish riders approach. Bronn and Jaime hide in the grass. Jaime watches the riders.
21770,BRONN: How many you count?
21771,JAIME: Four.
21772,BRONN: How many you think you can take?
21773,"JAIME: One, if he's slow."
21774,NARRATOR:Bronn turns to look at the riders.
21775,RIDER: Halt!
21776,"NARRATOR:The rider holds up his hand, and the party stops, having spotted Jaime and Bronn’s footsteps."
21777,"BRONN: Fucked in the arse. (Both get up). Hiya! (The riders approach them). Morning, lads. Glad we found you."
21778,RIDER: Who are you?
21779,BRONN: Cooper. (Points to Jaime). This is Darnell.
21780,RIDER: You're from King's Landing.
21781,BRONN: Accent gave me away? Flea Bottom. Whelped and whipped.
21782,RIDER: Why are you here?
21783,"BRONN: Our ship capsized in the night. We managed to swim ashore. It was a near thing, really."
21784,JAIME: I thought the sharks would get us. (Bronn looks at him).
21785,RIDER: There are no sharks in Dorne.
21786,JAIME: I could have sworn those were shark fins.
21787,BRONN: Dolphins maybe.
21788,RIDER: Throw your swords in the sand.
21789,"BRONN: Boys, there's no need for this. Just, point us in the right direction. We'll find our way home."
21790,RIDER: Swords in the sand! Now!
21791,"NARRATOR:Bronn and Jaime look at each other. They pull out their swords. Bronn puts his down in the sand, and then flings a knife into the throat of a rider. He then kills another, stabbing him and knocking him off of his horse. A third charges him, and Bronn knocks him off of his horse as well. However, he survives. Bronn turns to Jaime."
21792,BRONN: That one should be slow enough.
21793,"NARRATOR:Bronn approaches the fourth and final rider. Jaime turns to the injured rider, who is revealed to be much larger than Jaime. They begin fighting. In the background, Bronn knocks the fourth rider off of his horse. As Jaime and the man fight, Jaime is slowly pushed back, down a hill. He falls over and begins rolling to escape his attacker. He loses his balance and his sword is knocked away. As the attacker brings his sword down to kill Jaime, Jaime brings his gold hand up to block it. The sword gets stuck in Jaime’s hand. As the attacker is stuck trying to remove the sword, Jaime picks his back up, kills him, and kicks him down the hill."
21794,BRONN: Nice move! (Jaime turns to him).
21795,JAIME: Luck.
21796,BRONN: You had a wonderful teacher.
21797,"NARRATOR:Bronn turns and walks away. Jaime looks back down the hill, and then to his hand. Failing to shake the sword off, he is forced to dislodge it by kicking it out of his own hand. Bronn is then seen cleaning his sword off on the clothes of one of the dead riders. He sheaths his sword as Jaime approaches."
21798,BRONN: Always wanted a Dornish stallion. Beasts can run a day and night without tiring. We'll ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face.
21799,JAIME: First we need to bury these bodies.
21800,BRONN: Birds have to eat too.
21801,"JAIME: Corpses raise questions, questions raise armies. We're not here to start a war."
21802,BRONN: Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes?
21803,"JAIME: (Holding out his hand). I can't dig very well with one hand. Not at all, really."
21804,NARRATOR:Jaime walks away as Bronn’s face drops. He begins dragging a body.
21805,NARRATOR:EXT. BEACH
21806,"NARRATOR:Elaria, in all black, swiftly rides down a beach on horseback. She approaches a tent. Nearby are some more horses, and in the tent are Nymeria, Obara, and Tyene. Tyene exits the tent to meet her as she dismounts."
21807,TYENE: Nama!
21808,NARRATOR:Tyene and Elaria embrace.
21809,"ELARIA: Nym, Obara."
21810,OBARA: Will it be war?
21811,"ELARIA: Prince Doran will weep for your father, but nothing else. We must avenge Oberyn ourselves."
21812,OBARA: Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters.
21813,"ELARIA: We don't need an army to start a war. (Drinks water). Queen Cersei loves her children, and we have one of them."
21814,NYMERIA: We may have a problem.
21815,"NARRATOR:Nymeria uses a whip to knock a bucket away. Underneath is the captain who brought Jaime and Bronn to Dorne, buried neck-deep in sand and covered in scorpions."
21816,"OBARA: A ship's captain, who found me in Planky Town, claiming he had information to sell. He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne."
21817,"ELARIA: He's come for Myrcella. If he gets to her before we do, we lose our only chance for revenge. You must choose. Doran's way and peace, or my way and war."
21818,TYENE: (Walks towards her). I'm with you. Always. (Elaria puts a hand to her face).
21819,ELARIA: Nym? (Nymeria nods). Obara?
21820,"OBARA: When I was a child, (Begins walking), Oberyn came to take me to court. I'd never seen this man, and yet he called himself my father. My mother wept, said I was too young, and a girl."
21821,"NARRATOR:Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said, ""Girl or boy, we fight our battles. But the Gods let us choose our weapons."" My father pointed to the spear, and then to my mother's tears."
21822,"NARRATOR:Obara picks up a spear that was sticking out of the sand. She twirls it around for a moment, and then tosses it through the captain’s head, killing him."
21823,OBARA: (Smiles). I made my choice long ago.
21824,NARRATOR:Elaria and Tyene smile.
21825,CUT TO: EXT. BOAT AT SEA
21826,"NARRATOR:Jorah steers the boat as Tyrion, tied up and gagged, tries to speak. He only succeeds in mumbling. Eventually he stops trying to say real words, and instead only tries to be as loud as possible, to annoy Jorah. Jorah comes over and ungags him, and then walks back over to continue steering."
21827,TYRION: Thank you. (After a long pause). Who are you?
21828,JORAH: Your captor.
21829,TYRION: Do you have wine?
21830,JORAH: No.
21831,TYRION: I can't sleep without wine.
21832,JORAH: Then stay awake.
21833,TYRION: You're going the wrong way. My sister's in Westeros. Westeros is west! We're heading east.
21834,JORAH: I'm not taking you to your sister.
21835,TYRION: You said you were taking me to the Queen.
21836,JORAH: I am. Queen Daenerys Targaryen. She's the Queen I serve.
21837,TYRION: (Chuckles). What a waste of a good kidnapping. So happens I was heading there myself!
21838,JORAH: What business would you have with the Queen?
21839,"TYRION: Gold and glory. Oh, and hate. If you've ever met my sister, you'd understand. So now that it's clear we're on the same side? (Holds out his hands expectantly. Jorah makes no move to respond). A high born knight from the North of Westeros, down on his luck in Essos. Dragon epaulettes? Bear sigil breast plate. You're Jorah Mormont. I have to ask how, exactly, were you serving your Queen in a whore house, half a world away? Is it possible, that you were running? Why would you be running? And why would she have sent you away? Oh, wait! You were spying on her, weren't you? It's all coming back to me! I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings, but it's all coming back. You passed notes to Varys's little birds. She found out, didn't she? Found out, and exiled you. (Jorah looks downtrodden). And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift. A risky scheme. One might even say, desperate. Do you think Daenerys would execute me, and pardon you? I'd say the reverse is just as likely."
21840,"NARRATOR:Jorah stops steering and approaches Tyrion. Tyrion holds out his hands again, but Jorah strikes him, knocking him unconscious. He then goes back to steering, looking worried."

21843,NARRATOR:Daenerys and Ser Barristan stand on the balcony.
21844,DAENERYS: Everyone looks happy enough from up here. (Barristan chuckles). What?
21845,"BARRISTAN: I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep, into the streets of King's Landing."
21846,DAENERYS: Why?
21847,"BARRISTAN: He liked to walk among the people, he liked to sing to them."
21848,DAENERYS: He sang to them?
21849,BARRISTAN: Yes. Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then he'd sing. Just like all the other minstrels.
21850,DAENERYS: And what did you do?
21851,BARRISTAN: I made sure no one killed him. And I collected the money. (Daenerys looks surprised). Well he liked to see how much he could make.
21852,DAENERYS: He was good?
21853,BARRISTAN: He was very good. Viserys never told you?
21854,DAENERYS: He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people. (Sits down).
21855,BARRISTAN: Rhaegar never liked killing. He loved singing.
21856,DAENERYS: And what did you do with the money?
21857,"BARRISTAN: Well, one time, he gave it to the next minstrel down the street. One time, he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom. One time... we got horribly drunk. (They both laugh)."
21858,"DARIO: (Entering). Your Grace. Hizdahr is here, waiting in your audience chamber."
21859,DAENERYS: How many others are there?
21860,DARIO: Fifty a hundred.
21861,"DAENERYS: Will you be joining us, Ser Barristan?"
21862,DARIO: I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq.
21863,"DAENERYS: I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq. Go, Ser Barristan. Sing a song for me."
21864,BARRISTAN: Your Grace. (Leaves).

21866,HIZDAHR: All men must die. But not all can die in glory.
21867,MISSANDEI: Glory?
21868,"HIZDAHR: Why else do men fight? Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms? So their names would live on. Those who find victory in the fighting pits, will never become kings, but their names will live on. It's the best chance they'll ever have."
21869,DAENERYS: Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport?
21870,"HIZDAHR: Your Grace, today is the traditional start of the fighting season."
21871,DAENERYS: I do not recognize this tradition.
21872,"HIZDAHR: Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city, your city, together. (Shots of Sons of the Harpy walking through tunnels with torches). Without them, former slaves and former masters have nothing in common. Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment. I can't promise this is the answer to all our problems, but it's a start."
21873,NARRATOR:EXT. MARKETPLACE
21874,"NARRATOR:A prostitute and a soldier laugh with each other. Another soldier talks with some women. Some Sons of the Harpy kill all of the soldiers in the area, causing panic. In a nearby alley, some Unsullied march. Hearing the chaos, they begin running towards the market. They find the prostitute crying over the body of the dead soldier."
21875,WOMAN: (Speaking another language) Sons of the Harpy.
21876,"NARRATOR:She gestures in the direction the sons went. The Unsullied run in that direction. When they are out of view, she stops her act and wipes the tears away. The Unsullied enter a corridor, expecting to catch the sons. Instead, they themselves are ambushed from every direction by Sons of the Harpy. After a tense few moments, a fight breaks out. During the fight, one of the Unsullied’s helmet is knocked off, and is revealed to be Grey Worm. Another fight breaks out elsewhere. The two Unsullied there are killed almost immediately. Barristan walks down an alley and, upon noticing the chaos, heads to the fighting. Grey Worm is badly injured, and with his party killed, also badly outnumbered. Unsullied are shown being killed elsewhere. Grey Worm continues holding off the sons, and Barristan arrives to assist him. They are able to kill all of the sons, but are both seriously injured in the process. They fall unconscious, and the camera pans up to show them surrounded by all of the dead sons and Unsullied."

21882,"HIZDAHR: I am so sorry, my queen. He was a good man."
21883,"DAENERYS: ""Barristan the Bold"" they called him. He crossed a continent to serve me. He was a loyal friend. And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks."
21884,"DAARIO: We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate. Then we clean the city out, neighborhood by neighborhood, street by street, until the rats have nowhere left to hide."
21885,NARRATOR:Daario walks over the Daenerys and looks at Hizdahr. He looks back. Daenerys turns around.
21886,DAENERYS: I prefer your earlier suggestion. Round up the leaders of each of Meereen's great families and bring them to me.
21887,HIZDAHR: But... I'm the leader of my family.
21888,NARRATOR:Daario nods. The two men behind Hizdahr grab and restrain him. He is taken away.

21892,DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Walk forward.
21893,NARRATOR:The Unsullied lower their spears at the other men.
21894,MAN: (Valyrian) You cannot do this.

21896,DAENERYS: (Valyrian) Another step.
21897,NARRATOR:The Unsullied and the men take another step. Chains rattle and an unseen dragon snarls. Daenerys walks through the Unsullied to the front of the group.
21898,"DAENERYS: (Valyrian) They will eat you, if I tell them to. They may eat you even if I don’t. Children. Some say I should give up on them. (One of the men is mumbling). But a good mother never gives up on her children. She disciplines them if she must."
21899,"NARRATOR:Daenerys looks at Daario. He walks over and pushes the mumbling man forward, onto his knees."
21900,DAENERYS: (Valyrian) But she does not give up on them.
21901,"NARRATOR:The man’s eyes widen. A dragon comes out of the shadows and breathes fire on him. He screams and dies. The dragons take his corpse, tear it in two, and eat it."
21902,"DAENERYS: (Valyrian) Who is innocent? Maybe all of you are, (Looks at Hizdahr), maybe none of you are. Maybe, (Touching Hizdahr’s arm), I should let the dragons decide."
21903,HIZDAHR: (Valyrian) All men must die.
21904,"NARRATOR:The other men besides Hizdahr grovel before Daenerys. The dragons continue eating. After a moment, she takes her hand off of Hizdahr."

21911,"AEMON: And she's alone, under siege, no family to guide her or protect her. Her last relation thousands of miles away, useless, dying."
21912,"SAM: Don't say that, Maester Aemon."

21919,JON: How are you feeling?
21920,"AEMON: Oh, like a hundred-year-old man slowly freezing to death."
21921,"JON: I need your advice. There's something I want to do, something I have to do. But it'll divide the Night's Watch. Bitterly. Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order."
21922,"AEMON: Half the men hate you already, Lord Commander. Do it."
21923,JON: But you don't know what it is.
21924,"AEMON: That doesn't matter. You do. You will find little joy in your command. But with luck, you will find the strength to do what needs to be done. Kill the boy, Jon Snow. Winter is almost upon us. Kill the boy, and let the man be born."

21926,NARRATOR:Jon and Tormund sit across from each other at a table.
21927,JON: Where are the rest of the free folk now? (Tormund scoffs). Where have they gone? (No response). Who leads them?
21928,TORMUND: They followed Mance. They won't follow anyone else.
21929,JON: What about you?
21930,TORMUND: Hard to lead when you're in chains.
21931,JON: What if I unchained you?
21932,TORMUND: Why would you do that?
21933,JON: Because you are not my enemy. And I'm not yours.
21934,TORMUND: You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends.
21935,"JON: For 8,000 years the Night's Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men. And for 8,000 years we've fallen short of that oath. You belong to the realms of men. All of you."
21936,TORMUND: And now everything is going to change?
21937,JON: It is.

21941,JON: (Stands up). I'd have you go north of the Wall. Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here. I'll open the gates for them and let them through. I'll find them lands to settle south of the Wall.
21942,TORMUND: They won't kneel for you and neither will I.
21943,JON: I don't want them to kneel for me. I want them to fight with me when the time comes.
21944,TORMUND: The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them.
21945,"JON: And how many of your people can't fight? The women, the children, the old, the sick, what happens to them? You're condemning them to death. Worse than death because you're too proud to make peace. Or maybe you're not proud. Maybe you're just a coward."
21946,TORMUND: (Stands up). Easy thing to say to a man in chains.
21947,NARRATOR:Jon unchains Tormund. Tormund’s eyes widen as he feels his hands.
21948,JON: Your people need a leader. And they need to get south of the Wall before it's too late. We don't have much time and they have less. The walkers are coming and they'll hit your people first. I'm not asking you to make peace to save your skin. Make peace to save your people.
21949,TORMUND: Most of them are at Hardhome. You know where that is?

21963,SAM: (Standing up) There is good farmland in the Gift. (Laughter). Land that no one uses now. A dozen abandoned villages.
21964,MAN 2: And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages? Because the wildlings raided them for years. Cut them down! Just like they did this boy's people.
21965,"NARRATOR:The man points to Olly, who lowers his head. Sam sits down."
21966,ALLISTER: We've been fighting them all for thousands of years. They've slaughtered villages. They've slaughtered our brothers.

21968,"EDD: I will follow you anywhere, you know that. But they killed Grenn. And they killed Pyp. (Men mumble in agreement). They killed 50 of our brothers. I can't forget that. I can't forgive it."
21969,"JON: You were at the Fist of the First Men. If we abandon them, you know what they become. We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead. Whatever they are now, they're better than that."

21974,"OLLY: You don't mean it, do you? Telling the wildlings you want to make peace. You're just doing it to trick them."
21975,JON: It's not a trick.
21976,"OLLY: They burned my village. They put an arrow through my father's head right in front of me. They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew."
21977,JON: I know what it's like to lose the people you love. I know this is hard for you. But winter is coming. We know what's coming with it. We can't face it alone.

You're not going anywhere. Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy. Jealousy bores me. You remember what happens to people who bore me. You're not going to bore me, are you, Myranda?"

So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying. She fought me the whole time. She was lucky I didn't hang her, too. A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms. A baby she claimed was mine. I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river. (Stands up). But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now. You are my son. (After a moment). Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black. But he won't stay for long.

22233,JORAH: I think you'll be plenty.
22234,TYRION: You know what they say. The Doom still rules Valyria. What about the demons and the flames? Aren't you afraid of the Doom?

The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies; The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned; Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes. A fly upon a wall, the waves the sea wind whipped and churned -"""

22246,TYRION: What was that?
22247,NARRATOR:The boat passes into a tunnel. A Stone Man jumps down into the boat from the ceiling.
22248,JORAH: Stone Men! Don't let them touch you!
22249,NARRATOR:Jorah hits the stone man from behind before he gets to Tyrion. They begin fighting. Another stone man jumps into the water and begins trying to get on the boat. Tyrion tries to keep him off. Jorah manages to push the first man into the water. He then begins fighting the other one.
22250,JORAH: Get behind!
22251,"TYRION: Mormont, cut me free! (Jorah falls into the water). Mormont!"
22252,NARRATOR:Jorah climbs back onto the boat and fights off the stone man. He manages to get his sword and cuts the stone man. The other stone man inches his way towards Tyrion.
22253,TYRION: Mormont! Mormont!
22254,"NARRATOR:Jorah cuts through the stone man he was fighting and pushes him into the water. Tyrion rolls into the water to avoid the other one. He desperately tries to remove the rope around his hands. A stone man grabs his ankle and begins attempting to pull him down. The screen fades to black. After a few moments, we see Tyrion’s perspective. Jorah stands over him as his eyes slowly blink open."

22258,JORAH: You're heavier than you look. Did any of them touch you?
22259,"TYRION: (Shakes his head). You? (Jorah shakes his head). I've seen greyscale before, but nothing like that."
22260,JORAH: I suppose that's why they send them there.
22261,"TYRION: It'd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it. (Jorah spits). Thank you for saving me. Of course, I wouldn't have needed saving if you hadn't kidnapped me in the first place. (Jorah gets up). So what now?"
22262,"JORAH: We walk, up the coast. With luck, we'll find a fishing village. Maybe another boat."
22263,TYRION: Without luck?
22264,"JORAH: We've got a long walk ahead of us. I'll get some wood for a fire. Try to get some rest, huh?"
22265,TYRION: That's the best idea you've had all day.

My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl. My stepmother didn’t want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison. I found out, sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again. I’ve been serving them ever since."

22301,JAQEN: A lie.
22302,ARYA: I stabbed him in the gut. I tried to find my mother and brother. I never did. They were murdered by Walder Frey. An outlaw kidnapped me. A man called Polliver.
22303,NARRATOR:Jaqen hits her.
22304,JAQEN: A lie.
22305,"ARYA: A man called the Hound. Sandor Clegane. He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight. He begged me to kill him but I wouldn’t. I left him in the mountains to die. I wanted him to suffer, I hated him."

22323,JORAH: Of course I’m hungry.
22324,"TYRION: You’re an awful travelling companion, do you know that? Possibly the least charming man I have ever met."
22325,JORAH: I am not your travelling companion.
22326,TYRION: We are travelling together. In each other’s company. Therefore…
22327,JORAH: Do you ever shut up?

22329,NARRATOR:Jorah sits down next to Tyrion.
22330,JORAH: Why?
22331,TYRION: Never occurred to you to ask why until now? You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis.
22332,JORAH: I’m sure you’ve visited many brothels in many cities.
22333,TYRION: I killed my father. He wanted to execute me for a crime I didn’t commit. And he was fucking the woman I loved.
22334,NARRATOR:Jorah gets up.
22335,"TYRION: As miserable as you are, Mormont, at least your father was a good man."
22336,JORAH: What do you know about my father?
22337,"TYRION: I met him. I visited the Wall. When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories, every one of them. He actually cared about the people in his command. How did they put it in the Watch? “We shall never see his like again.”"
22338,NARRATOR:Jorah looks stunned.
22339,TYRION: You didn’t know. I’m sorry. I am.
22340,JORAH: How?
22341,TYRION: I only know what I heard
22342,JORAH (stronger): How?

22350,MAN: I have nowhere else to go. I’ve taken her to every healer in Braavos. I’ve spent every penny I had. She suffers every day of her life. I just want it to end.
22351,NARRATOR:Arya looks the man in the eyes then walks over to the girl.
22352,GIRL: It hurts.
22353,"ARYA: I know. Don’t be afraid. I used to be like you. I was sick. I was dying. But my father never gave up on me. He loved me. More than anything in the world, just like your father loves you. So he brought me here. My father prayed to the many faced god. And I drank the water from this fountain. It healed me."

22364,TYRION: I believe in many things.
22365,"JORAH: In something greater than ourselves, I mean. The Gods. Destiny. Do you believe there's a plan for this world?"
22366,TYRION: No.
22367,"JORAH: Neither did I. I was a cynic, just like you. Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs. When the fire burned out I thought I’d find her blackened bones. Instead I found her. Daenerys. Alive and unhurt. Holding her baby dragons. Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?"
22368,TYRION: No.
22369,JORAH: It's hard to be a cynic after that.
22370,TYRION: Doesn’t mean she’s going to be a great queen.
22371,JORAH: No it doesn’t.
22372,"TYRION: The Targaryens are famously insane. What if she conquers the world? Then what? 1,000 years of peace and prosperity?"
22373,JORAH: First we have to conquer the world.
22374,"TYRION: We? Alright, let’s assume your dreams come true. She’s ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf. She hacks off my head and restores your position. You command her army, sail to Westeros, defeat all your enemies, then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne. Hurrah, long live the Queen. Then what?"
22375,JORAH: Then she rules.
22376,TYRION: So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros? That’s justice?
22377,JORAH: She is the rightful heir.
22378,"TYRION: Why, because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king?"

22394,MALKO: And then chop off his cock. We can sell it for a fortune. A dwarf’s cock has magic powers.
22395,NARRATOR:The slaver puts his sword to Tyrion’s throat.
22396,"TYRION: Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can’t just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it. He has to know it came from a dwarf. And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf?"
22397,SLAVER: It will be a dwarf-sized cock.
22398,TYRION: Guess again.
22399,NARRATOR:Tyrion looks to Malko.

22425,BAELISH: That’s quite a family to abandon.

22427,BAELISH: Well done.

22438,BAELISH: House Tyrell won’t tolerate these insults.
22439,"CERSEI: House Tyrell won’t tolerate it? I’m the insulted party, Lord Baelish. Ser Loras was promised to me, instead he chose the company of boys."
22440,BAELISH: One’s choice of companion is a curious thing.
22441,NARRATOR:Cersei is silent for a moment.
22442,CERSEI: Most curious. Lysa Arryn for instance. A sorrily repellent woman. Forgive me. I know you’re still in mourning.
22443,BAELISH: Lysa was a good woman. A kind woman.
22444,"CERSEI: She was neither of those things, we both know it. Still, I pity her son. How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him."
22445,BAELISH: I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age.
22446,CERSEI: If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king?
22447,BAELISH: Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice. And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne.
22448,CERSEI: Good. (Cersei gets up) If there’s nothing else.
22449,"BAELISH: There is another matter, your Grace. Something so urgent I couldn’t trust the words to a raven. You once charged me with finding Arya Stark. To my shame I failed you. But I have found Sansa Stark. Alive, and well, and home again. In Winterfell."
22450,CERSEI: That’s not possible.
22451,"BAELISH: My sources are well placed. They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son, Ramsay, a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen."
22452,CERSEI: Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father.
22453,BAELISH: Indeed. As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart.
22454,CERSEI: We were fools to trust a turncloak.
22455,BAELISH: Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house.
22456,CERSEI: I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil.
22457,"BAELISH: I would counsel patience, your grace."
22458,"CERSEI: Patience? Sansa helped murder my son, Roose Bolton is a traitor."
22459,"BAELISH: Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor, marching with his army on Winterfell. Let Stannis and Roose battle, let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when they’re done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives."
22460,"CERSEI: Winterfell is 1,000 miles away from here. The weather has already begun to turn."
22461,"BAELISH: That is why it is critical to strike soon, while the victor still licks his wounds. Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force."
22462,CERSEI: My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse.
22463,"BAELISH: Ser Jaime, then."
22464,CERSEI: Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission. I’ve no idea when he’ll be back.
22465,"BAELISH: Perhaps I can help. The Knights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros, trained to battle in the ice and the snow."
22466,"CERSEI: Forgive me Lord Baelish, you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper, not a military man."
22467,"BAELISH: You wouldn’t risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury. What do you have to lose, a brothel keeper?"
22468,CERSEI: And if you succeed?
22469,BAELISH: Name me Warden of the North.
22470,CERSEI: I’ll speak to the king this evening. Have him issue a royal decree.
22471,BAELISH: I’ll not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell.
22472,CERSEI: And I’ll l know you’re a man of your word when I see Sansa Stark’s head on a spike.

22523,"NARRATOR:Trystane inspects Bronn’s armor, looking for a sigil."
22524,BRONN: Let’s not do something stupid.
22525,"NARRATOR:Trystane reaches for his sword and Bronn punches him across the face, knocking him out."
22526,MYRCELLA: No!
22527,BRONN: That was something stupid.
22528,"JAIME: We have to go, Myrcella, now."
22529,MYRCELLA: You hurt him!
22530,"JAIME: You’ll be fine, I promise, but we have to--"
22531,NARRATOR:A whip wraps around Jaime’s wrist. The Sand Snakes are here.
22532,BRONN: Oh for fuck’s sake.
22533,"NARRATOR:The Sand Snakes attack Jaime and Bronn, one wielding a spear, one wielding a whip, and one wielding a pair of daggers. They occupy Bronn and Jaime long enough for Obara to get to Myrcella."
22534,OBARA: You’re coming with me.
22535,MYRCELLA: I don’t want to!
22536,"OBARA: I wasn’t asking, princess."
22537,NARRATOR:Obara starts taking Myrcella out of the gardens. A Sand Snake cuts Bronn’s arm open. Areo and his men meet Obara as she escapes.

22544,"NARRATOR:Jaime drops the sword, Areo’s men grab him. Bronn drops his sword."
22545,BRONN (to Snake): You fight pretty good for a little girl.

22547,NARRATOR:EXT. THE KINGSROAD
22548,NARRATOR:A carriage rides on the outskirts of King’s Landing.
22549,RIDER: Halt!
22550,NARRATOR:Cut to inside the carriage.
22551,"OLENNA: Oh! You can smell the shit from 5 miles away. Well, why are we stopped, go on."
22552,"OLENNA: Rumors and gossip, that’s all they got. It’s theater, nothing more. If they arrested all the pillow biters in King’s Landing there’d be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else."
22553,MARGAERY: Everyone knew about him and Renly.
22554,OLENNA: Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms. Everyone knew. No one cared.
22555,MARGAERY: But he was the king’s brother.
22556,"OLENNA: And Loras is the queen’s brother. No, no, no, no, this is unacceptable."
22557,MARGAERY: Cersei is behind this.
22558,"OLENNA: Of course she is. She wants to drag our names through the dirt. Put us in our place. Get some rest, dear, you look appalling. Let me deal with Cersei Lannister."
22559,NARRATOR:INT. CERSEI’S ROOM
22560,NARRATOR:Cersei writes at her desk without acknowledging Olenna.
22561,"OLENNA: Your Grace, I have travelled a long way."
22562,CERSEI: You must be exhausted.
22563,"OLENNA: Put the pen down, dear, we all know you aren’t writing anything."
22564,"CERSEI: Ah, yes, the famously tart-tongued queen of thorns."
22565,OLENNA: And the famous tart Queen Cersei.
22566,CERSEI: Beg your pardon.
22567,OLENNA: I know you’re behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson.
22568,CERSEI: If you apologize for that comment perhaps--
22569,OLENNA: You’ll get your apology when I get Loras.
22570,CERSEI: I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras. I have no love for these fanatics. But what can the queen mother do?
22571,"OLENNA: Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops, gold, and wheat my house supplies?"
22572,CERSEI: I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains--
22573,OLENNA: Do you expect the alliance to continue after you’ve thrown our future into prison?
22574,"CERSEI: As I said, i didn’t imprison anyone. As for your veiled threats--"
22575,OLENNA: What veil?
22576,CERSEI: The Lannister-Tyrell alliance brought peace to a war-torn country. Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare?
22577,OLENNA: I didn’t trust your father. I didn’t particularly like him. But I respected him. He was no fool. He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them.
22578,"CERSEI: House Lannister has no rival. The High Septon has called for an inquest, not a trial. Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit, which I’m sure they don’t. Loras will be freed, our happy alliance will continue, and we’ll forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened. Good day, Lady Olenna."
22579,NARRATOR:INT. HIGH SEPTON’S ROOM
22580,HIGH SPARROW: You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly?
22581,LORAS: I don’t pay attention to rumors.
22582,"SPARROW: You were said to be despondent when he died. Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside, even as Stannis’ army closed in"
22583,LORAS: He was my friend. He was my king.
22584,"SPARROW: Wasn’t Joffrey your king? He was anointed by the 7, not Renly."
22585,LORAS: I was wrong to support Renly’s claim. I know that. But I was forgiven by Joffrey. I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater.
22586,SPARROW: Wearing Renly’s armor.
22587,LORAS: Why does it matter what I wore?
22588,"SPARROW: Do you deny all of the charges against you? Fornication, buggery, blasphemy."
22589,LORAS: Of course I deny them.
22590,SPARROW: You never lay with Renly Baratheon.
22591,LORAS: Never.
22592,SPARROW: Nor any other man.
22593,LORAS: Never.
22594,SPARROW: That will be all Ser Loras.
22595,NARRATOR:Loras walks back to his seat.
22596,OLENNA: Well I think that’s quite enough of that.
22597,SPARROW: Faith calls Queen Margaery forward.
22598,MARGAERY: You call me forward?
22599,SPARROW: Yes. We have some questions for you.
22600,MARGAERY: I am the queen.
22601,"SPARROW: You are. And according to Law of the Seven, neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest."
22602,NARRATOR:Margaery walks to the stand.
22603,SPARROW: How do you respond to these charges against your brother?
22604,MARGAERY: They are lies.
22605,SPARROW: All of them?
22606,MARGAERY: All of them.
22607,"SPARROW: Queen Margaery, in the presence of the gods, do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him, to the best of your knowledge?"
22608,"MARGAERY: Yes, I swear it."
22609,"SPARROW: Thank you, your grace."
22610,NARRATOR:The Faith brings Olyvar in. Loras looks shocked. Cersei gives a thin smile.
22611,SPARROW: Do you know this man?
22612,"OLYVAR: Yes, very well. He is Ser Loras Tyrell, heir to Highgarden."
22613,SPARROW: How did you come to meet?
22614,OLYVAR: I squired for him. He took a liking to me. He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met.
22615,SPARROW: And what occurred in his chamber?
22616,OLYVAR: We engaged in intimate relations.
22617,SPARROW: You laid with him?
22618,OLYVAR: That night and many others.
22619,LORAS: Liar! He’s a liar!
22620,SPARROW: Is there anyone else who can support your claim?
22621,"OLYVAR: Yes, yes, Queen Margaery. She walked in on us once not long ago. She didn’t seem surprised."
22622,CERSEI: This testimony is an insult to a great house. Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden?
22623,"OLYVAR: He has a birthmark, your grace. Quite high on his thigh, wine-colored, and roughly the shape of Dorne."
22624,NARRATOR:Loras jumps at Olyvar and The Faith restrains him. Margaery and Olenna get up to leave and The Faith blocks their way.
22625,LORAS: Liar!
22626,OLENNA: What are you doing? Let us pass.
22627,SPARROW: The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras... and Queen Margaery.
22628,MARGAERY: What?
22629,SPARROW: Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any. Take her.
22630,NARRATOR:The Faith grabs her and carries her out of the room.
22631,MARGAERY: Tommen! Tommen!
22632,"NARRATOR:King Tommen looks around the room, unsure of what to do."
22633,"MARGAERY: You can’t do this, I am the queen! Tommen, Tommen! I am your queen, how dare you!"
22634,NARRATOR:Olenna glares at Cersei. Cersei smiles back.
22635,NARRATOR:Sansa looks at herself in the mirror. She hears a knock and opens the door. It's Myranda.
22636,SANSA: What do you want?
22637,"MYRANDA: Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath, my lady. You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband don’t you?"
22638,NARRATOR:Cut to Sansa in the bath. Myranda washes the black dye out of Sansa’s hair.
22639,"MYRANDA: You’re so beautiful. But if you need to keep him happy. Ramsay gets bored easily. You dont want to end up like... Well, like the others."
22640,SANSA: What others?
22641,MYRANDA: I shouldn’t gossip. It’s good to see the red again. No point in hiding anymore.
22642,SANSA: What others?
22643,"MYRANDA: Let’s see. There was Kiera. The blacksmith’s daughter. She was tall. Like you. Lovely figure. But she talked and talked and talked and… Ramsay got tired of that. Then there was Violet. She had gorgeous blond hair. But she got pregnant and, well, that was boring. Then Tamsay. Such a sweet girl. Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while, don’t they? Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt."
22644,SANSA: Hunt?
22645,"MYRANDA: Mm. Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it? Not so pretty. But it’s your wedding day, why am I talking about such things?"
22646,SANSA: What was your name again?
22647,MYRANDA: Myranda.
22648,"SANSA: And how long have you loved him, Myranda. Did you imagine that he would be with you forever, is that it? Then I came along and ruined it. I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell. This is my home and you can’t frighten me."
22649,"MYRANDA: Are you done with your bath, my lady?"
22650,SANSA: Go. I can finish on my own.

22680,"SANSA: Lord Tyrion was kind, he was gentle, he never touched me."
22681,RAMSAY: You’re not lying to me?
22682,"SANSA: No, my lord."
22683,"RAMSAY: Lying to your husband on his wedding night, that would be a very bad way to start a marriage. We are man and wife now, we should be honest with each other, don’t you think?"

22816,STANNIS: We don’t have Robert’s bastard here.
22817,"MELISANDRE: No, we have someone better, and your blood runs through her veins."
22818,STANNIS: Have you lost your mind?
22819,MELISANDRE: Do you doubt me still? After all that you’ve seen?
22820,STANNIS: There must be another way. Leeches or something.
22821,MELISANDRE: There is only one way. You must become king before the Long Night begins. Only you can lead the living against the dead. All your life has led us to this moment. To this decision.
22822,STANNIS: She’s my daughter.
22823,NARRATOR:Melisandre embraces him.

22828,"BRAND: Where are you going, huh? Aren’t we better looking than the fat man?"
22829,"DERRYK: The question is, is she pretty down south in the real world, or is she pretty because she’s the only girl here?"
22830,"BRAND: Even in White Harbor, I’d want a kiss."
22831,"DERRYK: Come on love, give us a kiss."
22832,GILLY: Leave me alone.
22833,DERRYK: If you were my girl I wouldn’t leave you alone.

22841,SAM: Get your hands off her. Brother Derryk. Brother Brand. I believe you both have guard duty tonight.
22842,BRAND: Sam the Slayer. Are you gonna slay me with that sword?
22843,DERRYK: Look at his hands shaking.
22844,"SAM: Gilly go on, Get back to your room and lock the door."
22845,NARRATOR:Derryk throws her to the floor.
22846,SAM: I’m warning you.
22847,DERRYK: Come on! Come on!
22848,NARRATOR:Sam swings the sword. It is deflected and he is subdued. Derryk punches him in the gut then starts kicking him.
22849,"DERRYK: You lying sack of shit! Killed a White Walker, eh? You fatass fuck. Come on, get up. (to Gilly) He’s your hero. He’s a hog!"

22866,SAMMY: Just a bit woozy.
22867,NARRATOR:Sam collapses onto his side.
22868,NARRATOR:Gilly washes out Sam’s wounds with a wash cloth.
22869,GILLY: The next time you see something like that you leave it alone.
22870,SAM: I will not. They would’ve… I don’t know what they would have done
22871,GILLY: I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadn’t come.
22872,SAM: No. They were tiring out. I had them in the palm of my hand.
22873,"GILLY: Don’t be stupid Sam, you’re not a fighter."
22874,SAM: What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you?
22875,GILLY: Just promise me that whatever happens you’ll take care of little Sam.
22876,"SAM: Of course I will. And I’ll take care of you, too."

22886,NARRATOR:The slaves are carried up to the auction stage. One of Malko’s men whips Tyrion.
22887,"MALKO: A rare find for the fighting pits, my friends. Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate. This one’s a Westerosi knight from an ancient house, trained in sword and lance. he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea. He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke, slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword. He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat. Betrayed by his woman, he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts. Bidding begins at 12 gold honors."
22888,NARRATOR:A hand goes up.
22889,MALKO: 13. Do I have 14?

22896,TYRION: Wait! You have to buy me as well.
22897,BUYER: Why?
22898,"TYRION: We’re a team. I’m a great fighter, too."
22899,NARRATOR:The crowd laughs.
22900,MALKO: He’s funny. You have to give him that.
22901,"NARRATOR:The man holding Tyrion’s chains laughs at him. Tyrion yanks his chains, pulling the man to the ground, and starts beating on him with the chains as the crowd roars. Tyrion kicks him in the head then looks to the buyer."

22903,NARRATOR:He hands Malko coins.
22904,TYRION: Thank you my Lord. Thank you.
22905,BUYER: Yes.
22906,"TYRION: My Lord, if I may. I’ve heard Mereen’s become a free city. You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits. Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage…"
22907,NARRATOR:The buyer hits Tyrion in the mouth then tosses him a few coins.
22908,"BUER: Here’s your wages, funny man. It’ll last the rest of your life."
22909,DAARIO: How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow?
22910,DAENERYS: Don’t be ridiculous. My marriage to Hizdahr is political. I think he’s smart enough to understand that.
22911,DAARIO: I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.
22912,DAENERYS: Are you jealous?
22913,DAARIO: Do you think I’m petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?
22914,DAENERYS: I do.
22915,NARRATOR:Daario laughs.
22916,DAARIO: You’re right. My motivations are entirely impure.
22917,NARRATOR:They start kissing.
22918,DAARIO: Doesn’t make me wrong.
22919,"DAENERYS: You told me yourself, I can’t fight enemies within and without. So when enemies from without come knocking, I need the city of Mereen behind me. I have no choice."
22920,DAARIO: Everyone has a choice. Even slaves have a choice. Death or slavery.
22921,DAENERYS: So what else can I do?
22922,DAARIO: Marry me instead.
22923,"DAENERYS: Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing, I couldn’t."
22924,"DAARIO: Why not? You’re our queen, you can do as you like."
22925,DAENERYS: No. I can’t
22926,DAARIO: Then you are the only person in Mereen who’s not free.
22927,NARRATOR:Daenerys sits up in bed.
22928,"DAARIO: I know I’m here to serve my queen and not to give advice, but can I make one more suggestion?"
22929,DAENERYS: Of course
22930,"DAARIO: On the day of the Great Games, gather all the great masters, and wise masters, and worthy masters you can find, and slaughter them all."
22931,DAENERYS: I am a queen. Not a butcher.
22932,DAARIO: All rulers are either butchers or meat.
22933,"OLENNA: You there! Where would I find the High Septon, or High Sparrow, or whatever bloody fool name he’s got."
22934,"HIGH SPARROW: It’s not as good a name as Queen of Thorns, I’ll admit."
22935,OLENNA: You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady.
22936,SPARROW: You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
22937,OLENNA: Don’t spar with me little fellow.
22938,NARRATOR:The High Septon gets up.
22939,"SPARROW: For me, it’s the knees. You?"
22940,OLENNA: Hips.
22941,SPARROW: Huh.
22942,"OLENNA: A man of the people, is that your game? It’s an old game. dull and unconvincing. A man of the people who does Cersei’s dirty work for her."
22943,SPARROW: The people always do the dirty work.
22944,"OLENNA: Spare me the homilies, I can smell a fraud from a mile away."
22945,SPARROW: A useful talent.
22946,OLENNA: I’m here for my grandson and granddaughter.
22947,"SPARROW: Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied. The Father judges us all. Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen. If you break his laws you will be punished."
22948,NARRATOR:The High Sparrow heads for the door.
22949,OLENNA: Don’t you walk away from me.
22950,"SPARROW: You don’t give commands here, Lady Olenna."
22951,OLENNA: What is it you want? Gold? I’ll make you the richest septon who ever lived.
22952,NARRATOR:The High Sparrow laughs.
22953,OLENNA: What then?
22954,"SPARROW: I imagine this is strange for you. Everyone you meet has a hidden motive, and you pride yourself on slitting in and out. But I’m telling you a simple truth: I serve the gods. The gods demand justice."
22955,OLENNA: How do they communicate their demands? By raven or horse?
22956,SPARROW: By the holy text. The seven pointed star. If you don’t have one in your library I’ll give you my own.
22957,OLENNA (with contempt): I’ve read the seven pointed star.
22958,SPARROW: Then you’ll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury. Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws.
22959,"OLENNA: Half the men, women, and children in this foul city break the sacred laws. You live among murderers, thieves, and rapists. And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother?"
22960,SPARROW: Yes. The Gods’ laws must be applied to all equally.
22961,"OLENNA: If it’s equality you want then so be it. When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital, everyone here will starve. And I’ll make sure the hungry know who to blame,"
22962,"SPARROW: Have you ever served the field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. You are the few. We are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few…"

22969,NARRATOR:Tommen walks to the window. Cersei joins him.
22970,"CERSEI: No matter who you are, no matter how strong you are, sooner or later, you'll face circumstances beyond your control."
22971,TOMMEN: I’ll call in the army. I’ll take back the sept and kill every last one of them. I’ll start a war if I have to.
22972,CERSEI: You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be.
22973,TOMMEN: I love her. I love her. I can’t help her.
22974,CERSEI: We must be strong for those we love. We cannot give in to despair.
22975,TOMMEN: I will speak to the high sparrow. There must be something--
22976,CERSEI: Let me speak to him on your behalf. The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.
22977,CERSEI: Your happiness is all I want in this world
22978,TOMMEN: I know.
22979,"CERSEI: No you don’t. You can’t possibly. Not until you have children of your own. I would do anything for you. Anything to keep you from harm. I would burn cities to the ground. That is all that matters. You and your sister. From the moment you came into this world, my boy. My only boy."

22986,JAIME: And more hands. How’s Trystane?
22987,MYRCELLA: He’ll be alright.
22988,JAIME: I’m sorry for that. It wasn’t supposed to happen that way.
22989,MYRCELLA: Why is it happening at all?
22990,JAIME: Your mother’s worried about you. Threats have been made. Dorne is too dangerous for you. I’ve come to take you home.
22991,"MYRCELLA: This is my home, this has been my home for years. I didn’t want to come here but she told me to. I did what she said, I did my duty and now she’s forcing me to go back?"
22992,JAIME: It's for your own good. These are complicated matters.
22993,"MYRCELLA: It’s not complicated at all, it’s simple. I love Trystane, I’m going to marry him, and we’re staying right here."
22994,JAIME: I don’t understand.
22995,MYRCELLA: Of course you don’t! You don’t know me!
22996,NARRATOR:Myrcella leaves the room.
22997,"BRONN (singing): Brothers oh brothers, my days here are done, the Dornishman’s taken my life. Bur what does it matter, for all men must die, and I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife! Yes I’ve tasted the Dornishman’s wife!"

22999,TYENE: He’s got a good voice.
23000,OBARA: We’re lucky he’s a singer. If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble.
23001,BRONN: It’s against my code to hurt a woman.
23002,OBARA: It’s amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code.
23003,BRONN: I wouldn’t say you beat me.
23004,TYENE: How’s your arm?
23005,BRONN: Wonderful. Wouldn’t feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar.
23006,TYENE: You think you’re leaving Dorne?
23007,BRONN: No great hurry. Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world.
23008,TYENE: Thank you.
23009,BRONN: I said Dornish women. I didn’t say you.
23010,TYENE: I’m not the most beautiful woman you’ve ever seen?
23011,BRONN: I’ve seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms.
23012,TYENE: Name one more beautiful than I am.

23022,NARRATOR:Tyene undoes the rest of her tunic.
23023,TYENE: And how about your head?
23024,BRONN: My head… You don’t even wanna know what’s going on in…
23025,"NARRATOR:As Bronn scans her naked body, his vision starts to blur and he collapses to the ground."
23026,TYENE: Your nose is bleeding.
23027,BRONN: It’s nothing. It’s the dry air.
23028,"TYENE: My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei. They call it the Long Farewell. It takes time to work, but if a single drop makes contact with the skin, death."
23029,NARRATOR:She holds a tiny blue cap up to Bronn from her cell.
23030,TYENE: The only antidote. Who’s the most beautiful woman in the world?
23031,NARRATOR:Bronn gasps for breath.
23032,TYENE: Sorry? Who?
23033,BRONN (finally): You.

23040,BAELISH: It felt like the safest place.
23041,"OLENNA: Not for your clientele, clearly."
23042,"BAELISH: It was an establishment like no other. The sheer range of appetites catered to, desires that didn’t exist until we invented them."
23043,"OLENNA: You’ve always been rather impressed with yourself, haven’t you?"
23044,BAELISH: The past is the past. The future is all that’s worth discussing. The future of House Tyrell.
23045,"OLENNA: Don’t pretend to have any concern for my house, my grandchildren, or me. I should have known you’d return to the capital once things started going wrong."
23046,BAELISH: I promise you..
23047,"OLENNA: I promise you, Lord Baelish, that our fates are joined. Together we murdered a king. And if my house should fall, I would have nothing to hide. And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market, they’ll never even find what’s left of you. So do you deny a part in all of this?"
23048,BAELISH: Cersei summoned me to King’s Landing. I dared not refuse her.
23049,OLENNA: And what did she want?
23050,"BAELISH: A piece of info that she know that I had. Neither silence nor lies were an option. But I have other information of which she is unaware. And as you say, our interests are aligned. I have a gift for you."
23051,OLENNA: What kind of gift?
23052,BAELISH: The same kind I gave Cersei. A handsome young man.

We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother. Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow, but I fear The Faith has left reason behind."
23098,MARGAERY: I know you did this.
23099,CERSEI: We are making every effort on your behalf. I swear to you by all the seven gods.
23100,"MARGAERY: Lies come easily to you. Everyone knows that. But innocence, decency, concern? You’re not very good at those, I’m afraid. Perhaps that’s why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me."
23101,CERSEI: You’re upset. You’re not thinking clearly. I’ll visit again when you’ve had a chance to calm down.
23102,MARGAERY: I don’t want to see you again.
23103,"CERSEI: I do hope you change your mind about that. I’ve been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep, but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins."

23107,MARGAERY: Get out you hateful bitch!
23108,"CERSEI: Sleep well, sister."
23109,NARRATOR:Cersei walks out smiling. She is taken to High Septon’s room by a Sparrow.
23110,HIGH SPARROW (to Sparrow): Thank you. (to Cersei) You saw her?
23111,CERSEI: Yes.
23112,SPARROW: And?
23113,CERSEI: Her accommodations seem sufficient. What happens to her now?
23114,SPARROW: Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion. A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith.
23115,CERSEI: Who will stand judge?
23116,SPARROW: Seven septons. As it was in all trials before the Targaryens.
23117,CERSEI: Will you be one of them?
23118,SPARROW: I will.
23119,CERSEI: If one or both of them were to confess before the trial…
23120,SPARROW: Then they will be at The Mother’s mercy.
23121,CERSEI: What does The Mother’s mercy entail?
23122,"SPARROW: It depends on the situation. The acts themselves, the degree of contrition."
23123,CERSEI: Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.
23124,SPARROW: Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King’s Landing?
23125,CERSEI: I think I may have heard at one point.
23126,SPARROW: Baelor built his sept around it. But men worshipped here long before him.
23127,NARRATOR:The High Septon gestures to a stone altar with seven-pointed stars engraved into it.
23128,SPARROW: Who carved this altar do you know?
23129,CERSEI: I’m afraid i don’t.
23130,SPARROW: No one does. There’s no name on it. Or anywhere else in the chapel. The people who built this place didn’t inflict their vanity on the people who came after them. The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there. Their faith was clean.
23131,"NARRATOR:Strip away the gold and the ornaments, knock down the statues and the pillars, and this is what remains. Something simple, solid, and true. The Tyrell’s finery will be stripped away. Their lives knocked down, their true hearts laid bare for all to see. And so it will be for all of us, high and low alike. What will we find when we strip away your finery?"
23132,NARRATOR:The High Septon stares intently at Cersei.
23133,"SPARROW: A young man came to us not long ago, broken in body and spirit. He had so much to strip away, so much weighing him down. But piece by piece he unburdened himself. Let go of vanity, pride, sin, now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird."
23134,NARRATOR:Cersei gives a faint laugh.
23135,SPARROW: And he has much to say about you.
23136,NARRATOR:Lancell enters the room and stands next to the High Septon. Cersei goes for the door and is blocked.
23137,CERSEI: Move. Let me go immediately.
23138,NARRATOR:Cersei is grabbed and carried away from the room.
23139,CERSEI (O.S.): You will order her to let me go! I am the queen! I am the queen! Have you lost your mind? Let me go! You filthy… I am the queen! Let me go!

23144,NARRATOR:END EPISODE
23145,"JORAH: Your Grace, I want to say--"
23146,DAENERYS: You will not speak. How do I know you are who you say you are?
23147,TYRION: If only I were otherwise.
23148,DAENERYS: If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldn’t I kill you? To pay your family back for what it did to mine
23149,TYRION: You want revenge against the Lannisters? I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born. I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart. I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time.
23150,DAENERYS: So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family?
23151,TYRION: Into your service? Your Grace we have only just met. It’s too soon to know if you deserve my service.
23152,DAENERYS: If you’d rather return to the fighting pits just say the word.
23153,"TYRION: When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory. She had no wealth, no lands, no army, only a name and a handful of supporters, most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves. They kept her alive, moving her from place to place, often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her. She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that. And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth, lands, or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time, along with three dragons. He thought she was our best, last chance to build a better world. I thought you were worth meeting at the very least."
23154,DAENERYS: And why are you worth meeting? Why should I spend my time listening to you?
23155,TYRION: Because you can not build a better world on your own. You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule. The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you.
23156,DAENERYS: I have a very large army and very large dragons.
23157,TYRION: Killing and politics aren’t always the same thing. When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people. I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name.
23158,DAENERYS: So you want to advise me. Very well. (looks to Jorah) What would you have me do with him? I swore I would kill him if he ever returned.
23159,TYRION: I know.
23160,DAENERYS: Why should the people trust a queen who can’t keep her promises?
23161,"TYRION: Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you, he is no longer that man. I can’t remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you. He claims he would kill for you and die for you, and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him. And yet he did betray you."
23162,NARRATOR:Tyrion approaches Daenerys and Missandei. Her guards raise their spears to her. Daenerys waves them off.
23163,TYRION: Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals?
23164,"DAENERYS: Yes, many opportunities."
23165,TYRION: And did he?
23166,DAENERYS: No. Not until forced to do so.
23167,DAENERYS: So I should kill him?
23168,"TYRION: A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion. And you’re going to need to inspire devotion, and lots of it, if you’re ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea. But you cannot have him by your side when you do."
23169,DAENERYS: Remove Ser Jorah from the city.
23170,NARRATOR:Daenerys and Jorah hold back tears. Jorah is escorted out of the Pyramid. Jorah checks his Greyscale and walks away.

23176,SEPTA: Confess. I meant it.

23180,"ARYA: My name is Lana. I’m an orphan. When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters, and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more."
23181,NARRATOR:Arya pushes an oyster cart through a crowded market.
23182,"ARYA (V.O.): Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart. Now every morning I make my way down to the canals. I pass the fish mongers and the bakers. I usually see Lhara, my first customer of the day on my way home. Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane--"
23183,CUT TO: INT. HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
23184,NARRATOR:Jaqen slaps her.
23185,"ARYA: Left onto Ragman Lane, where I do most of my trade."
23186,JAQEN: Lana is very impressive. Very industrious. She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God.
23187,ARYA: How will she serve him?
23188,JAQEN: She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane. She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor.
23189,ARYA: What will she do there?
23190,JAQEN: She will see.
23191,ARYA: See what?
23192,"JAQEN: How can a man tell a girl this. If he knew what she would see, there would be no reason to send her."
23193,"ARYA: Oysters, clams and cockles!"

23195,ARYA: Oysters clams and cockles! Oysters clams and cockles!
23196,THIN MAN: Your oysters fresh?
23197,ARYA: Best in the city.
23198,THIN MAN: You wouldn’t lie to an old man would you?
23199,NARRATOR:Arya cracks an oyster and hands him one he slurps it.
23200,THIN MAN: Very nice. Give me 4. With vinegar.

23205,CUT TO: INT. THE HOUSE OF BLACK AND WHITE
23206,JAQEN: The man is a gambler. He wages that his sailor's ship will make it to its destination. It is a strange wager for the captain. He only wins if he loses his life.
23207,ARYA: So why would a captain make the wager in the first place?
23208,JAQEN: A girl tells a man that she has seen.
23209,"ARYA: If the captain dies, the thin man pays his family a lot of money."
23210,"JAQEN: But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesn’t have to pay after all. A destitute woman and her small child, what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself? To whom can they turn for recourse?"
23211,NARRATOR:Arya looks to see a man praying on the floor.
23212,ARYA: The Many Faced God. You said you didn’t know what I would see at the docks.
23213,JAQEN: A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not. A girl named Lana will return to the docks. She will watch the gambler. She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself.
23214,ARYA: And then what?
23215,JAQEN: A gift for the Thin Man.
23216,"NARRATOR:He holds up a clear vile. Arya takes the vile, smiling."
23217,WAIF: She is not ready.
23218,"JAQEN: Perhaps she is, perhaps she’s not."

23224,CERSEI: The charges?
23225,"QYBURN: Fornication, treason, incest, the murder of King Robert."
23226,CERSEI: All lies.
23227,"QYBURN: Of course, Your Grace. My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown. And I hope you’ll excuse me for saying it, but belief is so often the death of reason."
23228,CERSEI: I wish you’d said it sooner. Any word from Jaime?
23229,"QYBURN: I’m afraid not. Your Grace, Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King. He now presides over the small council."
23230,CERSEI: Tell him I need to speak to him.
23231,QYBURN: I implored him to visit you but he would not.
23232,"CERSEI: What about my son, the king? If you can visit me then surely the king--"
23233,"QYBURN: Your arrest, and Queen Margaery’s arrest, the king has not taken well. He remains in his chambers, his servants often find his food in the hall. Left untouched."
23234,"CERSEI: You need to talk to him, you need to talk to my son to come and see me, come and see his mother."
23235,"QYBURN: I tried my grace, he wouldn’t see me. He wouldn’t see anyone."
23236,CERSEI: I can’t stay here.
23237,"QYBURN: There is a way, Your Grace. A way out."

23244,THEON: Not Theon. There is no Theon. Reek.
23245,"SANSA: Reek. Why did you tell him, Reek?"
23246,"THEON: I was helping you. You were trying to escape, there is no escape. Not ever. Theon Greyjoy tried to escape. The master knew. He knows everything. He hunted him, he caught him, he strapped him to a cross, and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left."
23247,"SANSA: Good. If it weren’t for you I’d still have a family. If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here, right now, I would."
23248,THEON: I deserved everything. I deserve to be Reek. I did terrible things. Turned on Robb. Captured Winterfell. Killed those boys.
23249,"THEON: They weren’t “those boys”, they were Bran and Rickon. They were your brothers, you’d know them since they were born."
23250,THEON: They weren’t. They were only--
23251,SANSA: Only what?
23252,THEON: I can’t..
23253,SANSA: Tell me!
23254,"THEON: I can’t, not unless the master says..."
23255,"SANSA: Tell me, they weren’t what?!"
23256,THEON: They weren’t...
23257,"NARRATOR:SANSA Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air. Tell me to my face Theon, tell me that they weren’t your brothers!"
23258,THEON: They weren’t Bran and Rickon! I couldn’t find them. It was two farm boys. I killed them and burned them so no one would know.
23259,SANSA: You didn’t…?
23260,NARRATOR:Theon shakes his head no.
23261,"SANSA: Do you know where they went, Bran and Rickon?"
23262,THEON: I can’t talk to you anymore.

23267,"ROOSE: And how high can Stannis’ horses jump? Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced. We have enough food for six months. We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been. All we have to do is wait for them to freeze, starve, and mutiny."
23268,NARRATOR:Ramsay gives a disagreeing look.
23269,ROOSE: You disagree?
23270,"RAMSAY: Stannis isn’t from the North. You are, father. I think you’re missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders."
23271,ROOSE: And what do you recommend?
23272,"RAMSAY: That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be. That we hit first, and hit hard, and leave a feast for the crows."
23273,ROOSE: A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage. As long as we stay behind these walls they can’t touch us. Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldn’t get an army through if we wanted to.
23274,RAMSAY: I don’t need an army. I need 20 good men.

23276,DAENERYS: So have you decided yet? Whether I’m worthy of your service?
23277,TYRION: Have you decided yet whether you’re going to have me killed?
23278,DAENERYS: It’s probably my safest option.
23279,TYRION: I can see why you would think so. It’s what your father would have done.
23280,DAENERYS: And what would your father do?
23281,TYRION: My father? Who publicly sentenced me to death? I’d say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.
23282,DAENERYS: Is that why you killed him?
23283,"TYRION: Some day if you decide not to execute me, I’ll tell you all about why I killed my father. And on that day, should it ever come, we’ll need more wine than this."
23284,DAENERYS: I know what my father was. What he did. I know the Mad King earned his name.
23285,"TYRION: So here we sit, two terrible children of two terrible fathers."
23286,DAENERYS: I’m terrible?
23287,TYRION: I’ve heard stories.
23288,DANERYS: Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible?
23289,TYRION: To see if you were the right kind of terrible.
23290,DAENERYS: Which kind is that?
23291,TYRION: The kind that prevents your people from being even more so.
23292,DAENERYS: I did reopen the fighting pits. Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment.
23293,"TYRION:  Yes, that was wise. And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good. Very impressive. My own sister married someone she loathed as well, though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good, Gods forbid. She ended up having him killed."
23294,DAENERYS: Perhaps it won’t come to that.
23295,TYRION: It’s not impossible that Varys was right about you after all.
23296,DAENERYS: Varys? King Robert’s spy master?
23297,TYRION: Yes. He was the one who convinced me to come find you. He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself.
23298,DAENERYS: Jorah sent my secrets to Varys. For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me.
23299,TYRION: He did what he had to do to survive. He did a lot of other things that he didn’t have to do. I suspect he’s the main reason you weren’t slaughtered in your crib.
23300,DAENERYS: But you trust him?
23301,"TYRION: Yes, oddly. He might be the only person in the world that I trust. Besides my brother."
23302,DAENERYS: The brother who killed my father.
23303,TYRION: That’s the one.
23304,DAENERYS: Perhaps I will have you killed after all.
23305,"TYRION: Your queenly prerogative. I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for. You chop off my head? Well, my final days were interesting."
23306,DAENERYS: I’m not going to kill you.
23307,TYRION: No? Banish me?
23308,DAENERYS: No.
23309,"TYRION: So if I’m not going to be murdered, and I’m not going to be banished..."
23310,DAENERYS: You’re going to advise me. (takes his wine cup) While you can still speak in complete sentences.
23311,TYRION: Advise you on what?
23312,DAENERYS: How to get what I want.
23313,TYRION: The Iron Throne. Perhaps you should try wanting something else.
23314,DAENERYS: If I want jokes I’ll get myself a proper fool.
23315,TYRION: I’m not entirely joking. There’s more to the world than Westeros after all. How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here? Perhaps this is where you belong. Where you can do the most good.
23316,DAENERYS: I fought so that no child born into Slaver’s Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold. I will continue that fight here and beyond. But this is not my home.
23317,"TYRION: And when you get back to your home, who supports you?"
23318,DAENERYS: The common people.
23319,"TYRION: Let’s be generous and assume that’s going to happen. Here in Slaver’s Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people. What was that like, ruling without the rich? House Targaryen is gone, not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you. The Starks are gone as well, our two terrible fathers saw to that. The remaining Lannisters won’t back you, not ever. Stannis Baratheon won’t back you either, his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours. That leaves the Tyrells. Not impossible, but not enough."
23320,"DAENERYS: Lannister, Targaryen, Baratheon, Stark, Tyrell. They’re all just spokes on a wheel. This one's on top, then that ones on top and on and on it spins, crushing the people on the ground."
23321,TYRION: It’s a beautiful dream. Stopping the wheel. You’re not the first person to have dreamt it.
23322,DAENERYS: I’m not going to stop the wheel. I’m going to break the wheel.

23379,TORMUND: You trust me Jon Snow?
23380,JON: Does that make me a fool?
23381,TORMUND: We are fools together now.
23382,"NARRATOR:They walk to meet the men and women of Hardhome, lead by the Lord of Bones."
23383,TORMUND: Lord of Bones. Been a long time.
23384,LORD OF BONES: Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner. The other way around now. What happened?
23385,TORMUND: War.
23386,LORD OF BONES: You call that a war? The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king.
23387,TORMUND: We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk.
23388,LORD OF BONES: You don’t give the orders here.
23389,TORMUND: I’m not giving an order.
23390,LORD OF BONES: Why aren’t you in chains?
23391,JON: He’s not my prisoner.
23392,LORD OF BONES: What is he?
23393,JON: We’re allies.
23394,NARRATOR:The Hardhome wildlings complain loudly.
23395,LORD OF BONES: You fucking traitor! You fight for the crows now.
23396,TORMUND: I don’t fight for the crows.
23397,JON: We’re not here to fight. We’re here to talk.
23398,"LORD OF BONES: Is that right? You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund. And when you’re done talking, do you get down on your knees and suck his cock--"
23399,NARRATOR:Tormund grabs the Lord of Bones’ staff from him and beats him to death with it.
23400,TORMUND: Gather the elders and let’s talk.
23401,"NARRATOR:Jon is surrounded by Karsi, a Wildling chieftess, Loboda, a Thenn, a Wildling elder, and various other Wildlings."
23402,JON: My name’s Jon Snow. I’m Lord Commander of the Night’s Watch. We’re not friends. We’ve never been friends. We won’t become friends today. This isn’t about friendship. This is about survival. This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and what’s out there.
23403,KARSI: You built that wall to keep us out.
23404,LOBODA: Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live?
23405,JON: In normal times we wouldn’t. But these aren’t normal times. The white walkers don’t care if a man’s Free Folk or Crow. We’re all the same to them. Meat to their army. But together we can beat them.
23406,"KARSI: Beat the white walkers? Good luck with that. Run from them, maybe."
23407,NARRATOR:Jon holds the bag full of Dragonstone to Karsi. She looks at it hesitantly.
23408,JON: It’s not a trick. It’s a gift for those who join us.
23409,NARRATOR:Karsi examine the glass in shock.
23410,JON: Dragonglass. A man of the Night’s Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker.
23411,LOBODA: You saw this?
23412,JON: No. But I trust the man.
23413,KARSI: There are old stories about Dragonglass.
23414,LOBODA: There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds.
23415,KARSI: And with the things we’ve seen you don’t believe them?
23416,JON: Come with me and I'll share these weapons.
23417,KARSI: Come with you where?
23418,JON: There are good lands south of the wall.  The Night's Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands.
23419,NARRATOR:There is hesitation.
23420,"JON: I knew Mance Rayder. He never wanted a war with the Night’s Watch, he wanted a new life for his people. For you. We’re prepared to give you that new life."
23421,KARSI: If…?
23422,JON: If you swear you join us when the real war begins.
23423,LOBODA: Where is Mance?
23424,JON: He died.
23425,LOBODA: How?
23426,JON (after a long pause): I put an arrow through his heart.
23427,NARRATOR:The wildlings in the cabin start to riot.
23428,LOBODA: I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.
23429,NARRATOR:Loboda brandishes his axe. Tormund steps forward.
23430,"TORMUND: None of you saw Mance die! I did. The Southern King who broke our army, Stannis, wanted to burn him alive to send him a message. Jon Snow defied that cunt’s orders. His arrow was mercy. What it did took courage, and that’s what we need today: the courage to make peace with men we’ve been fighting for generations."
23431,"KARSI: I lost my father, my uncle, and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows."
23432,"JON: I’m not asking you to forget your dead. I’ll never forget mine. I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall. But I’m asking you to think about your children now. They’ll never have children of their own if we don’t band together. The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it. No clan can stop them. The free folk can’t stop them. The Night’s Watch can’t stop them. And all the southern kings can’t stop them. Only together, all of us, and even then it might not be enough, but at least then we’ll give the fuckers a fight."
23433,NARRATOR:There are small nods of approval throughout the room.
23434,"KARSI: You vouch for this man, Tormund?"
23435,"TORMUND: He’s prettier than both my daughters, but he knows how to fight. He’s young, but he knows how to lead. He didn’t have to come to Hardhome. He came because he needs us. And we need him."
23436,LOBODA: My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow.
23437,"KARSI: So would mine, but fuck 'em, they’re dead."
23438,NARRATOR:Karsi walks in front of Jon.
23439,NARRATOR:I’ll never trust a man in black.
23440,NARRATOR:Karsi walks over to Tormund.
23441,"NARRATOR:But I trust you, Tormund. If you say this is the way, we’re with you."
23442,TORMUND: This is the way.
23443,WILDLING ELDER: I’m with Tormund. We stay here we’re dead men. At least with King Crow there’s a chance.
23444,GIANT: Tormund.
23445,"LOBODA: Keep that new life you want to give us. Keep your glass, King Crow. Soon as you get on his ships they’re gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea. That’s our enemy. That has always been our enemy."
23446,NARRATOR:Wildlings start leaving the cabin and head towards the boats.
23447,KARSI (to Tormund): I fucking hate Thenns.
23448,NARRATOR:Tormund nods.
23449,"NARRATOR:Jon, Tormund, and Karsi lead the Wildlings to the boats."
23450,JON: How many are with us? 5000?
23451,TORMUND: I’m not good at counting.
23452,JON: We’re leaving too many behind.
23453,TORMUND: The free folk are stubborn. You know how long it took Mance to band them together. 20 fucking years.
23454,JON: And he knew them better than I ever will.
23455,TORMUND: They’re running out of food and there’s nothing to hunt. They’ll come around.
23456,NARRATOR:Cut to Karsi loading two children onto a boat.
23457,"KARSI: Johnna is gonna look after you. She’s in charge, you listen to her."
23458,DAUGHTER: I wanna go with you.
23459,"KARSI: I need to get the old folks on the boats. I’m right behind you, I promise. (she kisses them on the forehead) Go on."
23460,NARRATOR:The Giant picks up a piece of Dragonglass and strokes it intently. Edd begins picking up the pieces of glass and looks at the giant with his piece of glass. Wun Wun turns to Edd and stares at him annoyed.
23461,WUN WUN: Lokh kif rukh?
23462,NARRATOR:Edd leaves. Dogs are barking outside.
23463,NARRATOR:Jon loads girls onto a boat then turns to hear the dogs barking. The wind starts whipping from a neighboring cliff and the dogs start whimpering. Every wildling and Crow slowly turns to the source of the noise.
23464,LOBODA: Shut the gate.
23465,NARRATOR:Men hurry towards the gate to board it up. More howling from the distance. The Wildlings on the other side of the gate begin charging the gate.
23466,LOBODA: Shut the gate!!
23467,NARRATOR:Men rush to put a board in place to hold the gate shut.
23468,SHOUTING: Wait! Open the gate! Let us in! Help us! Please open it!
23469,"NARRATOR:Loboda walks to the gate with his axe and peers through a small hole in the wall. There is a faint scream in the distance, then a wight charges at the hole in the wall."
23470,LOBODA: Ready your arrows!
23471,NARRATOR:The wights claw at the gate. Arrows are nocked and fired. A wight sticks his hand through the gate and Loboda chops it off.
23472,NARRATOR:There is a mad rush towards the boats with many people jumping in the water to catch one.
23473,JON: Get in line! Get in line!
23474,NARRATOR:A wight tries to climb the gate.
23475,NARRATOR:Wights crawl to the top of the cabin and jumps through the hole in the roof. The men prepare their weapons and the giant growls.
23476,"NARRATOR:One wight tries to climb under the gate. A barrage of arrows flies at the wights trying to get through the wall. Most of them land. The wight crawls even further under the gate. The wights start making holes in the gate. A sword sticks through the gate coming close to Loboda on the gate. Loboda dodges the sword, looks down to see the wight crawling under the gate, and stomps its head in."
23477,"NARRATOR:The people continue to rush onto the boats with Jon, Tormund, and Karsi leading them."
23478,JON: Hold the line! Hold the line!
23479,NIGHT’S WATCH BROTHER: Lord Commander!
23480,JON: Get them to the ship and come back for me!
23481,BROTHER: But you’ll never make it--
23482,JON: Now!
23483,NARRATOR:Karsi approaches Jon.
23484,JON: You should be on one of those boats.
23485,KARSI: So should you ! My little girl has gone on. They're gonna let them pass the wall even if you’re not there ?
23486,JON: You have my word. I’ve given orders.
23487,KARSI: Don’t think you’re gonna be there to enforce those orders !
23488,NARRATOR:Karsi heads back to helping people onto the boats.
23489,"TORMUND: If they get through, everyone dies !"
23490,JON: Night’s Watch with me! Move! Move! Move!
23491,"NARRATOR:Jon, Tormund, Karsi, and the Night’s Watch brothers charge from the shore to the gate."
23492,"NARRATOR:The wights have knocked a hole into the gate big enough to crawl out of. One breaks through, tears someone apart, and then is taken down. A group of wights storm through the same hole. Cut to an overhead that shows just how many wights are behind the gate."
23493,"NARRATOR:Jon arrives at the gate. He pins a wight to the gate with Longclaw as Tormund and Karsi kill the wights that have already gotten through. The archers take out the wight Jon pinned to the gate, and then the men cover the hole the wights had been escaping from with a sled."
23494,NARRATOR:Fighting continues. A group of wights tear into a Crow. Loboda and Karsi continue to kill the wights.
23495,NARRATOR:Jon looks up through the mist and sees 4 White Walkers on horseback on the top of the cliff.
23496,JON: The Dragonglass!
23497,"LOBODA: You’re with me, lad! Now!"
23498,"NARRATOR:Jon and Loboda charge towards the cabin. Jon cuts a wight in half then kills another. The giant breaks through a wall in the cabin as the cabin starts to go down in flames. He shakes the wights off of his back, snapping some in half and stomping others into pieces. Jon and Loboda storm the cabin."
23499,NARRATOR:The entire cabin is on fire. A White Walker wielding a staff walks towards them through the fire.
23500,LOBODA: Get the glass.
23501,"NARRATOR:Loboda walks towards the White Walker as Jon scrambles towards the Dragonglass. Loboda misses with his axe twice, getting it caught in the wall. He pulls it out to parry in time, but the Walker’s spear shatters his axe. The Walker plunges his spear through Loboda's stomach."
23502,"NARRATOR:Jon reaches the glass but is thrown across the room by the Walker before he can pick it up, causing Longclaw to fly out of the cabin. Jon ducks from the Walker’s swings with his spear, and runs out to grab another sword. The Walker swings and shatters the sword. He knocks Jon down again. Jon struggles, then gets up again, running to pick up Longclaw. He stumbles and drops the sword. The White Walker staggers towards him. Jon picks up Longclaw just in time to match the White Walker, and to both of their surprises, Longclaw stops the Walker’s spear. The Walker deflects one blow from Jon, but then he swings and shatters the Walker into pieces."
23503,NARRATOR:Jon falls to the ground after the struggle. The Night’s King watches him alone from the top of the cliff.
23504,"NARRATOR:Tormund and Karsi continue to tear through wights. Karsi looks up, and sees a group of blue-eyed wight children staring at her. They do nothing for a moment, then charge at her, chewing and clawing her to death."
23505,"NARRATOR:Cut to Jon crawling across the snow, coughing up blood. A man grabs him and Jon puts Longclaw to his neck. The man turns out to be Edd and they lower their weapons."
23506,JON: The Dragonglass!
23507,EDD: Fuck the glass! We’re gonna die here.
23508,"NARRATOR:A screech comes from the top of the cliff. Hundreds of wights dive from the top of the cliff. They appear to have died for a brief moment after landing, but then wake up and charge at Jon and Edd."
23509,NARRATOR:Cut to Tormund continuing to hold the gate. The gate starts creaking then comes down. Tormund runs to the boat.
23510,"NARRATOR:The giant starts roaring as the other gate comes down, swinging a fiery log. Jon, Tormund, and Edd sprint towards the boat with the giant clearing a path for them with the log. The Night’s King continues to watch them from the top of the cliff."
23511,"NARRATOR:Jon, Tormund, and the Crow jump off the dock onto the boat."
23512,JON: Go! Go! Go!
23513,"TORMUND: Wun Wun, to the sea."
23514,"NARRATOR:The giant stays back, continuing to take out loads of wights by swinging his flaming log. He begins to walk towards the boat, ripping the wights hanging onto him off of his back and throwing them into the water to die."

23516,"NARRATOR:Jon looks back to shore to see the Wights, along with a White Walker, killing the last surviving wildlings."
23517,"NARRATOR:Slowly, a figure walks to the end of the dock. The camera pans up to reveal the Night’s King. He stares at Jon and Jon stares back. The Night’s King turns his head to the carnage at the edge of the shore and then looks back to Jon. He slowly starts raising his arms.The dead wildlings twitch, then open their eyes to reveal blue. Karsii comes back to life, blue-eyed . They all start standing up, joining the army of the dead, and staring at Jon. Jon can do nothing but stare back at the Night’s King back as the boat drifts away."

23524,STANNIS: Horses?
23525,"DAVOS: We’re still getting a count, but hundreds are dead."
23526,STANNIS: 20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm?
23527,DAVOS: The northerners know more about their land than we ever will.
23528,"STANNIS: Put last night’s guards in chains, either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy. Find out the truth and then hang them."
23529,"DAVOS: Unless there’s a thaw, we can’t press forward to Winterfell, and we don’t have enough food to get us back to Castle Black."
23530,STANNIS: We’re not returning to Castle Black.
23531,"DAVOS: Forgive me, Your Grace, I never claimed to be an expert in military matters. But if we can’t march forward, and we won’t march back…"

23544,"SAM: You didn’t fail him, or him, or her. Every one of them is alive because of you, and no one else."
23545,JON: I don’t think that fact’s lost on them.
23546,"NARRATOR:Cut to many men of the Night’s Watch glaring at Jon, then Olly who exchanges a long look with Jon from the top of the stairs. Alliser walks down the steps to Jon."

Tell the Lord Commander to send food, supplies, fresh horses, in return when I take the throne I’ll make sure the Night’s Watch has all the men it requires. He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes."
23552,"DAVOS: Your Grace, you’ve named me your Hand."
23553,STANNIS: Yes.
23554,"DAVOS: The King’s Hand should never abandon the King, especially in a time of war."
23555,"STANNIS: You’re not abandoning me, you’re obeying a command."
23556,DAVOS: A boy with a scroll could deliver this message.
23557,"STANNIS: And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll, what does the boy say? I didn’t name you hand for your expertise in military matters, ride for Castle Black, don’t come back empty handed."
23558,"DAVOS: Your Grace, perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me."
23559,STANNIS: My family stays with me.
23560,DAVOS: At least let me take Shireen. A siege is no place for a little girl.

23568,DAVOS: Well that sounds like a proper story.
23569,"SHIREEN: Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar. He polished his shield for a week, til the steel was like a mirror. Then he crouched behind it, and crept forward, hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection."
23570,"DAVOS: But the dragon only saw a dumb man, holding a mirrored shield."
23571,SHIREEN: And burnt him to a crisp.

23581,DAVOS: Of course I will.
23582,SHIREEN: But why am I getting a present?
23583,"DAVOS: Because you deserve it. My son was always on me trying to teach me to read. Gods, I was stubborn about it. Made it this far without reading, seemed to me I could make it to the grave. I wish I had listened to them. This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up. (beat) I’ll be gone for a few days, Princess. I’ll want to hear all about the dance of dragons when I’m back."

23590,MYRCELLA: Uncle.
23591,JAIME: What a lovely dress.
23592,MYRCELLA: You don’t like it?
23593,JAIME: You must be cold.
23594,MYRCELLA: Not at all. The Dornish climate agrees with me.
23595,JAIME: Prince Trystane. How’s your jaw?
23596,TRYSTANE: A fleabite.
23597,ELLARIA: What are you doing in Dorne?
23598,"JAIME: Looking out for the safety of my niece, the princess Myrcella."
23599,DORAN: And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force.
23600,JAIME: We received a threatening message. The princess’s necklace in the jaws of a viper.
23601,NARRATOR:Jaime looks at Ellaria.
23602,MYRCELLA (surprised): That necklace was stolen from my room.
23603,NARRATOR:Doran looks at Ellaria. A servant sets down food and drink before Jaime.
23604,JAIME: Ah. Excellent. The last meal before the beheading.
23605,DORAN: We can’t behead you. Many in Dorne want war. But I’ve seen war. I’ve seen the bodies piled on the battlefields. I’ve seen the orphans starving in the cities. I don’t want to lead my people into that hell.
23606,"ELLARIA: No, you want to break bread with the Lannisters."
23607,"DORAN: And that is precisely what we are doing. (raises glass) Let us drink to Tommen, the first of his name, the King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms."
23608,NARRATOR:Everyone drinks. Ellaria dumps her cup out on the floor and looks at Doran.
23609,DORAN: King Tommen insists on his sister’s return to the capital?
23610,JAIME: I’m afraid he does.
23611,"DORAN: I cannot disobey my King’s command. (Ellaria glares at Doran) She will return with you to King’s Landing. And my son, Prince Trystane, will accompany you both. If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue, their engagement must stand."
23612,JAIME: I accept.
23613,"DORAN: One more thing. My brother was named to the small council before his death. Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop. With Oberyn gone, Trystane will take his place on the small council."
23614,JAIME: You have my word.
23615,ELLARIA: The word of a Kingslayer.
23616,NARRATOR:Ellaria gets up and walks to Doran.
23617,ELLARIA: No wonder you can’t stand. You have no spine.
23618,NARRATOR:Ellaria tries to leave the room. Doran grabs her wrist.
23619,"DORAN: You are mother to four of my nieces, girls I love very much. For their sake, I hope you live a long life. Talk to me that way again and you won’t."
23620,NARRATOR:Doran lets go. Ellaria leaves the room.
23621,JAIME: May I inquire into the fate of my man?
23622,"DORAN: Tell me, Ser Jaime, in King’s Landing, how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince?"
23623,JAIME: He said it was just a fleabite. The fault is mine. Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders. If anyone should be punished it’s me.
23624,DORAN: Prince Trystane must learn judgement if he’s to rule one day. I’ll let him decide.
23625,NARRATOR:Jaime looks to Trystane. Trystane considers.
23626,TRYSTANE: I have learned the value of mercy from my father. I will set your man free.
23627,JAIME: You’re a good man.
23628,TRYSTANE: On one condition.
23629,NARRATOR:Bronn is laying on the ground in his cell. Tyene and Nymeria are playing a game where one tries to slap the other’s hand before they pull their hands away. Nymeria slaps Tyene.
23630,TYENE: You’re going to miss.
23631,NYMERIA: I never miss.
23632,TYENE: You will. You’re thinking too much. Now you’re nervous. “What if she’s right?”
23633,NARRATOR:Nymeria slaps at Tyene and Tyene gets out of the way in time.
23634,NYMERIA: Luck.

23640,NARRATOR:Bronn starts leaving the prison.
23641,"TYENE: Say it one more time, handsome. Who am I?"
23642,BRONN: The most beautiful woman in the world.
23643,TYENE: And that’s the truth!
23644,NYMERIA: Slut.
23645,NARRATOR:Tyene laughs.
23646,NARRATOR:Areo escorts Bronn into Doran’s room.
23647,"JAIME: Prince Doran, Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
23648,DORAN: : I didn’t realize there were knights of the Blackwater.

23651,BRONN: Prince. Sorry about the other day.
23652,JAIME: Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy. He’s agreed to grant you your freedom.

23660,MAN: How much for your little clam?
23661,"NARRATOR:They laugh and walk away. Arya looks down the street and sees the Thin Man, looking over another sailor’s application."
23662,"ARYA: Oysters, clams, and cockels! Oysters, clams, and cockels!"
23663,"NARRATOR:Arya stops her cart, inspects the vile Jaqen gave to her, and tucks it back in her pouch. She starts pushing the cart again and makes eye contact with the Thin Man."
23664,THIN MAN (waving): Come on.
23665,NARRATOR:Arya stares off into the distance.
23666,"THIN MAN: Some oysters, girl! I’m talking to you! Girl?! Are you deaf? Girl?!"
23667,"NARRATOR:Arya looks to the dock, and sees Meryn Trant and Mace Tyrell being helped off the boat. A Iron Banker approaches him and Arya starts walking away from the Thin Man and towards them."
23668,"BANKER: Lord Tyrell! On behalf of the Iron Bank, may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos. I hope your journey was trouble free."
23669,MACE: Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful. Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor.
23670,BANKER: And how goes the harvest in the Reach?
23671,"MACE: Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century. If we come to a satisfactory arrangement, I’ll be sure to send the Arbor’s finest your way."
23672,BANKER: I’m afraid I don’t partake.
23673,"NARRATOR:Arya studies the group, focuses in on Meryn, and begins following them with her cart."
23674,"MACE: Some consider usury distasteful, dishonorable. Pure nonsense, of course."
23675,BANKER: I'm glad we see eye-to-eye on this matter.
23676,MACE: Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms? Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands.
23677,NARRATOR:Meryn and Arya exchange quick looks at each other.
23678,BANKER: Most unfortunate for the glovers.
23679,"MACE: If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose, so why charge him? Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble."
23680,"BANKER: We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank, Lord Tyrell."
23681,MACE: You are the world's best gamblers. And all those bets you won built this.
23682,NARRATOR:Mace gestures to the Iron Bank and the camera cuts to it.
23683,"NARRATOR:Arya is waiting on the steps of the building opposite the bank, eating her oysters. The men start walking out of the Bank."
23684,BANKER: I’m afraid I still have a good deal of work to do.
23685,"MACE: Oh, nonsense. Work's over. Do you sing?"
23686,BANKER: I don't have that gift.
23687,"MACE: It's not a gift, it’s a skill, anyone can learn it. “So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town, for we are going to die, tomorrow. The bareheaded beggar, the king with his crown…”"
23688,NARRATOR:Meryn Trant and his men walk through the doorway.
23689,MERYN: I thought that old shit would never stop singing.
23690,"MAN: It wasn’t bad, though."

23692,NARRATOR:They arrive at a door.
23693,"MERYN: This is the place, lads. The sleekest little minks in Braavos."
23694,MAN: You’re buying?

23701,NARRATOR:The brothel keeper gestures nods for Arya to go on. She walks to the prostitute and the man she’s with.

23714,MERYN: Too old.
23715,NARRATOR:The people in the room share uneasy glances as they realize what he’s asking for.

23720,NARRATOR:The man drags her into the room.
23721,MAN: Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters.
23722,MAN 2: I’ll have one.

23724,HEAD: Who let this girl in? Shoo shoo!

23733,"HEAD: I’ll have you whipped, girl! Go on!"

23739,JAQEN: And?
23740,ARYA: The Thin Man wasn’t hungry today.
23741,JAQEN: Perhaps that’s why the man is thin.
23742,"NARRATOR:The man drops to the ground, creating a thud off-screen."
23743,ARYA: Tomorrow.
23744,JAQEN: Tomorrow.
23745,JAQEN: A girl has work to do.
23746,NARRATOR:Arya walks towards the man who is now collapsed on the ground.
23747,NARRATOR:Doran is addressing Ellaria with Areo standing guard next to the three Sand Snakes.
23748,"DORAN: Your rebellion is over. You can swear your allegiance to me now, or you can die."
23749,"NARRATOR:She kneels and kisses his ring, crying. Nymeria and Obara look disgusted, Tyene’s face reveals less."
23750,DORAN: I believe in second chances. I don’t believe in third chances.
23751,NARRATOR:Jaime is writing a letter in his former cell that is now unlocked. Ellaria enters.
23752,ELLARIA: You write like a 7 year old.
23753,JAIME: Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me.
23754,ELLARIA: He didn’t try to make you pay?
23755,ELLARIA: Then maybe he’s changed. The Queen will be thrilled to know you’ll be bringing her daughter home
23756,JAIME: She will.
23757,"ELLARIA: You love her very much, don’t you?"
23758,"JAIME: Of course, she’s my niece."
23759,ELLARIA: I wasn’t talking about her.
23760,NARRATOR:Jaime looks up from his writing at Ellaria.
23761,"ELLARIA: You think I disapprove. Why? Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from? They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from. Here, no one blinked an eye. 100 years ago, no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen.  It’s always changing, who we’re supposed to love and who we’re not.The only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want."
23762,"NARRATOR:Ellaria pauses, taking a walks around the room."
23763,ELLARIA: I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved. Perhaps even you were innocent of that.

23765,NARRATOR:INT. SHIREEN’S TENT
23766,NARRATOR:Shireen plays with her stag figurine next to a fire and on top of her book. Stannis enters the tent.
23767,SHIREEN: Father. Aren’t you cold?
23768,STANNIS: No. What are you reading?
23769,SHIREEN: The Dance of Dragons.
23770,STANNIS: What’s it about?
23771,"SHIREEN: It’s the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms. Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne. When people started for declaring for one of them or the other, their fight divided the kingdom in two. Brothers fought brothers. Dragons fought dragons. By the time it was over, thousands were dead. And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well. They never truly recovered."
23772,STANNIS: “The dance of dragons”? Why is that a dance?
23773,SHIREEN: That’s just what they call it.
23774,STANNIS: Doesn’t make much sense.
23775,SHIREEN: I think it’s poetic.
23776,"STANNIS: If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon, who would you have chosen?"
23777,SHIREEN: I wouldn’t have chosen either. It’s all the choosing sides that made things so horrible.
23778,"STANNIS: Sometimes a person has to choose. Sometimes the world forces his hand. If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself, the choice is not choice at all. He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be. However much he may hate it."
23779,"SHIREEN: It’s alright, father."
23780,STANNIS: You don’t even know what I’m talking about.
23781,SHIREEN: It doesn’t matter. I want to help you. Is there any way I can help?
23782,STANNIS: Yes there is.
23783,"SHIREEN: Good, I want to. I’m the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and I’m your daughter."

23788,SHIREEN: Where’s my father? I want to see my father.
23789,"MELISANDRE: It will all be over soon, Princess."
23790,NARRATOR:The men drag her to the pyre and tie her up.
23791,"SHIREEN: Where’s my father? No you can’t do this, father where are you?!"
23792,NARRATOR:Stannis watches on from the crowd.
23793,"SHIREEN: Let me see my father! Where are you, please?!"
23794,SELYSE: It’s what the Lord wants. It’s a good thing. A great thing.
23795,"MELISANDRE: The year is now, my Lord. For you we offer up this girl, that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way."
23796,"SELYSE: If we don’t act then we’ll all starve here all of us, but if we make this sacrifice…"
23797,"MELISANDRE: Accept this token of our faith, my lord and lead us from the darkness. Lord of Light show us the way!"
23798,"SHIREEN: Mother, please mother! Mother, please mother!"
23799,SELYSE: I can’t.
23800,STANNIS: There’s no other way. She has King’s blood.
23801,"MELISANDRE: Lord of Light protect us, for the night is dark and full of terrors!"
23802,"SHIREEN: Mother, don’t do this please! Please help! Don’t do this! Please, father! Mother, help!"
23803,"NARRATOR:Melisandre lights the pyre. Selyse runs towards the pyre and is stopped by Stannis’ men. Shireen burns as Melisandre, Selyse, and Stannis look on, Melisandre pleased, Selyse horrified, and Stannis conflicted."
23804,SELYSE: No...
23805,"NARRATOR:Daenerys sits next to Missandei at the top of the pit, with an open seat between her and Tyrion at the end, and Daario standing behind them. Hizdahr takes the open seat."
23806,DAENERYS: Where have you been?
23807,HIZDAHR: Just making sure everything’s in order.
23808,NARRATOR:Camera pans through the fighting pit to reveal it is covered with House Targaryen sigils. An announcer steps to the middle of the pit and waves his arm to silence the crowd.
23809,"ANNOUNCER (Valyrian): Free citizens of Meereen! By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen, welcome to the Great Games!"
23810,"ANNOUNCER: My queen, our first contest. Who will triumph: the strong or the quick?"

23812,"STRONG: I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious queen."
23813,NARRATOR:They stand waiting in front of her. The crowd is silent.
23814,HIZDAHR: They’re waiting for you. Clap your hands.
23815,"NARRATOR:Daenerys looks down at the two men. After a moment, and with a look of disgust on her face, she claps her hands. The crowd roars and they start fighting. After some parries, the Quick man slices at the Strong man’s neck."
23816,"DAARIO: That one, the smaller man, no question, that’s where you should put your money."
23817,TYRION: The smaller man it is.
23818,DAENERYS: I’m not putting my money anywhere.
23819,HIZDAHR: Kings and queens never bet on the games. Perhaps you should go find someone who does.
23820,DAARIO: People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits. (looks at Hizdahr) He would have bet against me. Common novice mistake.
23821,"HIZDAHR: I have spent much of my life in Meereen, and in my experience, larger men do triumph over smaller man, far more often than not."
23822,"DAENERYS: Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting? You, yourself, have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you?"
23823,NARRATOR:Hizdahr is silent.
23824,"DAARIO: Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one, the crowd saw me, all skin and bone back then, then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me. They couldn’t get their money out fast enough. But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here (he puts a dagger to his neck) or here (he puts the dagger to Hizdahr’s neck). And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles weren’t. Yes, whenever I saw a beast like that one, standing across from me making his beast faces, I knew I could rest easy."
23825,NARRATOR:The Strong man decapitates the Quick man with one quick stroke. Hizdahr smiles and Daario looks turns away angrily. Tyrion says nothing.
23826,HIZDAHR: You don’t approve?
23827,TYRION: There’s always been more than enough death in the world for my taste. I can do without it in my leisure time.
23828,TYRION: It’s easy to confuse what is with what ought to be. Especially when what is has worked in your favor.
23829,HIZDAHR: I’m not talking about myself. I’m talking about the necessary conditions of greatness.
23830,"NARRATOR:Cut to pit workers carrying the decapitated head out of the pit, leaving a trail of blood behind."
23831,DAENERYS: That is greatness?
23832,HIZDAHR: That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen. Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt.
23833,TYRION: My father would have liked you.
23834,ANNOUNCER: We ask again: who will triumph?
23835,DAENERYS: One day your great city will return to the dirt as well.
23836,HIZDAHR: At your command?
23837,DAENERYS: If need be.
23838,ANNOUNCER: A Meereenese champion?
23839,NARRATOR:The crowd applauds.
23840,HIZDAHR: How many people will die to make this happen?
23841,DAENERYS: If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason.
23842,HIZDAHR (looks at pit): Those men think they’re dying for a good reason.
23843,DAENERYS: Someone else’s reason.
23844,"HIZDAHR: So your reasons are true, and theirs are false. They don’t know their own minds, but you do."
23845,"TYRION: Well said, you’re an eloquent man. Doesn’t mean you’re wrong. In my experience, eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles."
23846,ANNOUNCER: ...or a Westerosi Knight?!
23847,NARRATOR:Crowd jeers.
23848,"JORAH (O.S.): I fight and die for your glory, oh glorious Queen."
23849,NARRATOR:Daenerys stares at Jorah. They both hold back emotion.

23853,"NARRATOR:Jorah squares off against a flashy fighter that just brutally stabbed another fighter through the back. He slices Jorah in the cheek. The other two fighters square off, with a heavily armored fighter wielding a spear killing his opponent. The crowd cheers."
23854,"NARRATOR:Jorah’s opponent slices Jorah’s arm then knocks him over, knocking his sword out of his hand. He holds his blade to Jorah’s throat. Both he and Jorah look to Daenerys."
23855,TYRION: You can end this.
23856,HIZDAHR: She cannot.
23857,TYRION: You can!
23858,"NARRATOR:The fighter holds his blade to Jorah’s throat. He is about to make a move when the other fighter comes over and stabs Jorah’s opponent in the back, killing him. Jorah gets up and faces the final opponent. Jorah matches the spearman, is knocked over, but catches the spear before it reaches his throat. He gets back up and the two face off again. Jorah spins, somersaults, and stabs him through the stomach, killing him. He looks up to Daenerys."
23859,NARRATOR:Jorah reaches for his opponent’s spear. He picks it up and hurls it towards Daenerys’ seat. Daario rushes to protect Daenerys and everyone else gets out of the way. It connects with a Son of the Harpy.

23864,"NARRATOR:Two Sons of the Harpy come up on Hizdahr from behind and stab him to death. They run at Daenerys. Daario takes one out, and Jorah comes up from the pit to take Hizdahr’s spot and take out the other. He offers his hand to Daenerys and she takes it. He leads her down to the pit with Daario and the Unsullied, leaving Tyrion and Missandei."
23865,"NARRATOR:A Harpy comes towards Missandei. Tyrion comes from behind, pulls him to his knees, and slits his throat. He leads her down to the pit."
23866,TYRION: Stay close!
23867,"NARRATOR:Sons of the Harpy have began to rush the pit. Unsullied fight them off as Daenerys, Daario, and Jorah head towards a side exit."
23868,JORAH: This way!
23869,"NARRATOR:They run through the exit, but a door swings shut. A Son of the Harpy steps out and Jorah kills him."
23870,"DAARIO: The other side, follow me!"
23871,NARRATOR:They rush towards the other side and join up with Tyrion and Missandei.
23872,DAARIO: Protect your queen!
23873,"NARRATOR:Jorah, Daario, and the Unsullied form a ring around Missandei, Daenerys, and Tyrion in the center of the pit. Sons of the Harpy begin to rush from the other exit they were heading towards. They surround the ring, testing out the outer ring before they begin rushing. A few make it past the outer ring but are killed by Daario. Missandei and Daenerys join hands and Daenerys closes her eyes."
23874,"NARRATOR:A roar is heard in the distance. All of the Harpys look up. Drogon appears, breathing fire and circling the pit. The Sons run away from Daenerys to the edge of the pit. One charges at her and Drogon rips him apart. He breathes fire on 4-5 of them at a time before a spear hits his back. 2 more spears connect and he starts slowing down."
23875,DAENERYS: Drogon!
23876,"NARRATOR:She takes a spear from his neck. He roars at her, but then closes his mouth. She slowly reaches to touch his nose. More spears are thrown at him by Sons of the Harpy and he turns to them and roars. Daario continues to fight off every Harpy that comes near her."
23877,NARRATOR:Daenerys climbs onto Drogon’s back slowly.
23878,DAENERYS: Valahd..
23879,"NARRATOR:Drogon runs towards the Harpys, starts flapping and then takes off from the Pit. He flies past the Pyramid and into the sky as Tyrion, Jorah, Daario, and Missandei stare up at him."

23903,"NARRATOR:ALLISER THORNE pounds his fist three times on the high table, then stands. The room quiets."
23904,ALLISER THORNE: You all know why you’re here. Jon Snow is dead.

23907,NARRATOR:The Night’s Watch brothers resume shouting.
23908,ALLISER THORNE: And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle.
23909,NIGHT’S WATCHMEN #1: Murderers!
23910,NIGHT’S WATCHMAN #2: Traitors!
23911,NARRATOR:The shouting resumes. OLLIE walks up beside the high table. ALLISER THORNE pounds the high table again.
23912,ALLISER THORNE: You’re right!
23913,NARRATOR:The shouting stops.
23914,"ALLISER THORNE: We’ve committed treason, all of us. Jon Snow was my Lord Commander. I had no love for him. That was no secret. But I never once disobeyed an order. Loyalty is the foundation on which the Night’s Watch is built, and the Watch means everything to me. I have given my life, we have all given our lives to the Night’s Watch. Jon Snow was going to destroy the Night’s Watch. He let the wildlings through our gates, as no Lord Commander has ever done before. He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered. Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right, I’ve no doubt about that. And what he thought was right would have been the end of us. He thrust a terrible choice upon us, and we made it."
23915,NARRATOR:The men begin to murmur among themselves.
23916,NARRATOR:GHOST nudges JON SNOW’s hand and whimpers.
23917,DAVOS: He’ll have seen we didn’t come. Thorne will have made it official by now. Castle Black is his.
23918,"DOLOROUS EDD: I don’t care who’s sitting at the high table. Jon was my friend, and those fuckers butchered him. Now we return the favor."
23919,DAVOS: We don’t have the numbers.
23920,DOLOROUS EDD: We have a direwolf.
23921,"DAVOS: It’s not enough. I didn’t know Lord Commander Snow for long, but I have to believe he wouldn’t have wanted his friends to die for nothing."
23922,"DOLOROUS EDD: If you were planning to see tomorrow, you picked the wrong room. We all die today. I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go."
23923,"DAVOS: We need to fight, but we don’t need to die. Not if we have help."
23924,NIGHT’S WATCHMAN: Who’s gonna help us?
23925,DAVOS: You’re not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow.
23926,NARRATOR:DOLOROUS EDD’s washes over with realization. He turns to the Night’s Watchman at his side.
23927,DOLOROUS EDD: Bolt the door. Don’t let anyone in. I’ll be back as soon as I can.
23928,NARRATOR:DOLOROUS EDD leaves through the door.
23929,RAMSAY (V.O.): She was 11 the first time I saw her.
23930,NARRATOR:MYRANDA’s body lies on a table.
23931,"RAMSAY: The kennelmaster’s daughter. She smelled of dog. I wasn’t much older, but everybody was already afraid of me. You certainly were."
23932,"NARRATOR:RAMSAY turns and looks at MAESTER WOLKAN, then looks back at MYRANDA’s body.."
23933,"RAMSAY: Myranda wasn’t, though. What could I do to her that those hounds couldn’t? She was fearless. There was nothing she wouldn’t do."
23934,NARRATOR:RAMSAY stands and places his hand on MYRANDA’s forehead.
23935,RAMSAY: Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over. I wish you could be here to watch.
23936,NARRATOR:RAMSAY looks as though he is going to cry.
23937,"MAESTER WOLKAN: Shall I have a grave dug for her, my lord? Or would you rather the men build a pyre?"
23938,"RAMSAY: Buried, burned?"
23939,NARRATOR:RAMSAY walks past MAESTER WOLKAN as he exits the room.
23940,RAMSAY: This is good meat. Feed it to the hounds.
23941,NARRATOR:RAMSAY is walking with ROOSE.
23942,"ROOSE: Your command of the cavalry was impressive. Thanks to you, the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead. Do you know who struck the killing blow?"
23943,RAMSAY: No.
23944,"ROOSE: A shame.  I’d reward the man.  Still, a great victory. Do you feel like a victor?"
23945,NARRATOR:RAMSAY and ROOSE stop walking. RAMSAY looks back over his shoulder at ROOSE.
23946,"ROOSE: I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark. Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired, outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army?"
23947,RAMSAY: No.
23948,NARRATOR:ROOSE walks past RAMSAY into Winterfell’s great hall.
23949,ROOSE: A reckoning will come. We need the North to face it. The entire North. They won’t back us without Sansa Stark. We no longer have Sansa Stark. You played your games with her. You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now they’re both gone.
23950,RAMSAY: I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds. They won’t get far.
23951,"ROOSE: I’m glad to hear it. Without Sansa, you won’t be able to produce an heir. And without an heir, well…"
23952,"NARRATOR:ROOSE sits at the dinner table. RAMSAY stares at him, astonished."
23953,ROOSE: ...let’s hope the maesters are right and Lady Walder’s carrying a boy.
23954,NARRATOR:EXT. NORTHERN WILDERNESSSANSA and THEON are running through the woods frantically. The barking of dogs can be heard in the distance. SANSA tires. THEON runs back to hear and pulls her onward.

23956,"NARRATOR:The pair resume running. They happen upon a large, snowy river."
23957,THEON: We have to cross here.
23958,NARRATOR:SANSA steps on a patch of thin ice and gasps.
23959,SANSA: I can’t.
23960,THEON: It’s the only way to throw off the hounds.
23961,SANSA: But it’s too cold. I can’t. I won’t make it. I’ll die.
23962,THEON: I’ve seen what his hounds do to a person. This way is better.
23963,NARRATOR:THEON guides SANSA into the water. SANSA gasps at the cold. The both wade across.
23964,NARRATOR:THEON and SANSA are walking together. They are blue with cold. Barking can no longer be heard. THEON spots something off camera.

23969,THEON: Stay here. I’ll lure them away.
23970,"SANSA: No, I won’t make it without you."
23971,"THEON: You will. Go north, only north. Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black. He’ll help you."
23972,NARRATOR:THEON runs into the woods but is immediately confronted by House Bolton soldiers and hounds.
23973,BOLTON OFFICER: Where is Lady Bolton?
23974,THEON: Dead.
23975,BOLTON OFFICER: Liar.
23976,THEON: She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts. I left her to die in the snow.
23977,NARRATOR:The dogs catch SANSA’s scent and begin barking. They lead the soldiers to SANSA under the roots of the tree. SANSA cowers from them.
23978,BOLTON OFFICER: I can’t wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time.
23979,NARRATOR:One of the soldiers grabs SANSA and pulls her to her feet. A horse whinnies in the distance. The soldiers draw their weapons. BRIENNE and PODRICK ride towards the soldiers with their sword drawn.
23980,BOLTON OFFICER: It’s a bloody woman.
23981,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE cuts down BOLTON OFFICER as she rides past. PODRICK engages one of the soldiers in mounted combat. BRIENNE faces off with another mounted soldier. Their blades clash, but neither is hit. As BRIENNE rides past him, another soldier knocks her from her horse. She drops her blade but scrambles to retrieve it when she sees a soldier advancing towards her on foot. When she reaches the blade, the soldier kicks her. She retrieves the blade again and stands, engaging him in a swordfight. She cuts him down. A mounted soldier charges at BRIENNE. She jumps and strikes him, causing his horse to fall over, trapping him beneath it. While PODRICK continues his mounted sword fight, THEON grabs the blade of a fallen soldier off the ground. PODRICK cuts down the soldier he is fighting and they both fall from their horses. Another soldier advances on PODRICK, and they begin fighting. BRIENNE crawls over to the man trapped beneath his horse and slits his throat with a dagger. The soldier PODRICK is fighting knocks PODRICK’s sword out of his hand. PODRICK falls to the ground. Just before the soldier is about to strike PODRICK, THEON stabs the soldier from behind. PODRICK stands up. BRIENNE walks over to SANSA. SANSA stands up to confront her. BRIENNE places her blade on the ground in front of SANSA and kneels before her."
23982,"BRIENNE: Lady Sansa, I offer my services once again. I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be. I swear it by the old gods and the new."
23983,NARRATOR:SANSA turns at looks at THEON for confirmation. THEON nods his head.
23984,SANSA: And I vow...that you shall always have a place by my hearth and…
23985,PODRICK: Meat and mead at my table.
23986,SANSA: Meat and mead at my table. And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor. I swear it by the old gods and the new. Arise.
23987,NARRATOR:BRIENNE stands up. SANSA smiles at BRIENNE.
23988,NARRATOR:CERSEI is sitting in the dark by a table. The door to her chamber opens and a handmaiden enters.
23989,"HANDMAIDEN: Your Grace, I’m sorry to disturb you. A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor."
23990,NARRATOR:CERSEI smiles.
23991,CERSEI: Myrcella…
23992,"NARRATOR:CERSEI runs through the courtyard and out to the harbor. She descends the steps to the harbor where a small boat is coming to shore. Her smile fades. As the small boat gets closer to shore, it is revealed to be carrying JAIME and a casket. CERSEI begins to tear up."
23993,"NARRATOR:JAIME is standing on the balcony, looking out. A bell tolls in the background. JAIME turns and looks back into CERSEI’s room, then enters it."
23994,CERSEI: Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body?
23995,JAIME: Mother.
23996,"CERSEI: All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now. Every day, every night, what does Mama look like now? Has she started to bloat? Has her skin turned black? Have her lips peeled back from her teeth?"
23997,NARRATOR:CERSEI begins to tear up.
23998,CERSEI:  I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt.
23999,NARRATOR:JAIME walks over to CERSEI and kneels in front of her.
24000,CERSEI: I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse.
24001,"JAIME: Shh, shh. Don’t think about it."
24002,CERSEI: I have to. I have to. It’s not right she has to suffer alone.
24003,JAIME: She’s not suffering. She’s gone. No one can hurt her anymore.
24004,"CERSEI (crying): She was good. From her first breath, she was so sweet. I don’t know where she came from. She was nothing like me. No meanness, no jealous, just good."
24005,JAIME: I know.
24006,"CERSEI: I thought if I could make something so good, so pure...maybe I’m not a monster."
24007,"CERSEI: No, I knew this would happen. The witch told me years ago. She promised me three children. She promised me they’d die. “And gold their shrouds.” Everything she said came true. You couldn’t have stopped it. It’s prophecy. It’s fate."
24008,JAIME: You don’t believe that.
24009,"CERSEI: Of course I do. You told me yourself when Father died. You said we had to stay together. You said people would try to tear us apart, take what’s ours. That was a prophecy, too. I didn’t listen to you, and everything you said came true."
24010,NARRATOR:JAIME places his hand on CERSEI’s cheek..
24011,"JAIME: Fuck prophecy. Fuck fate. Fuck everyone who isn’t us. We’re the only ones who matter, the only ones in this world. And everything they’ve taken from us, we’re going to take back and more."
24012,NARRATOR:JAIME embraces CERSEI.
24013,JAIME: We’re going to take everything there is.
24014,"SEPTA UNELLA: “The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men. They scream in agony and their shame is so great, they do not feel the flames, for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed, they were saved.”"
24015,MARGAERY: I’d like to see my brother.
24016,SEPTA UNELLA: Confess.
24017,MARGAERY: Please. How is he? At least tell me that.
24018,SEPTA UNELLA: Confess.
24019,MARGAERY: I am the queen and I demand to see my brother.
24020,SEPTA UNELLA: Sinners don’t make commands. They make confessions.
24021,NARRATOR:SEPTA UNELLA slams the scripture book closed and approaches MARGAERY aggressively.
24022,NARRATOR:The door opens and HIGH SPARROW enters.
24023,HIGH SPARROW: Septa Unella.
24024,NARRATOR:HIGH SPARROW sighs.
24025,HIGH SPARROW: Our other guests need you.
24026,NARRATOR:SEPTA UNELLA exits. HIGH SPARROW walks over to MARGAERY and gently pulls her hair away from her face.
24027,HIGH SPARROW (whispering): There.
24028,NARRATOR:MARGAERY looks up at HIGH SPARROW.
24029,HIGH SPARROW: Septa Unella can be overzealous at times. I’ll speak with her.
24030,"MARGAERY: My brother, can you tell me how he is?"
24031,NARRATOR:HIGH SPARROW sits on a stool beside MARGAERY.
24032,HIGH SPARROW: It isn’t Ser Loras that brings me here. Your husband misses you dearly. The love between a man and wife is sacred. It reflects the love the gods have for all of us. But sin leads us away from the sacred. And only confession can purge sin.
24033,MARGAERY: I have nothing to confess.
24034,HIGH SPARROW: So you believe you are pure? Perfect? Wholly without sin?
24035,MARGAERY: None of us are.
24036,HIGH SPARROW: You have started down the path. But you have many miles to go..
24037,NARRATOR:HIGH SPARROW exits. MARGAERY hugs her knees.
24038,DORAN: I always envied Oberyn. He lived. He truly lived. Sailed around the world. Fought men from every country. Lay with the most beautiful women alive.
24039,ELLARIA: And men.
24040,"DORAN: And men. He experienced everything, while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed. But that is life. We each have our roles."
24041,NARRATOR:DORAN sits in his wheelchair. ELLARIA places a pillow behind him.
24042,DORAN: Oberyn was born to be an adventurer. And I was born to rule.
24043,"ELLARIA: The gods are not fools. You would have been a lousy adventurer. And Oberyn, pfft, he would have been a terrible ruler."
24044,NARRATOR:A maester approaches.
24045,"DORAN (to TYENE): Your mother is a brilliant woman, you know that?"
24046,MAESTER: Prince Doran.
24047,NARRATOR:The maester bows and hands DORAN a scroll. DORAN unravels and reads it.
24048,DORAN: The Princess Myrcella…
24049,"NARRATOR:TYENE produces  a dagger from her boot and stabs AREO in the back, killing him. ELLARIA produces a dagger of her own and stabs DORAN in the chest. The maester tries to run away, but TYENE retrieves her dagger from AREO’s body and throws it into the back of the maester’s neck, killing him. ELLARIA removes her dagger from DORAN’s chest and pushes him to the ground. The remaining guards do nothing."
24050,"ELLARIA: When was the last time you left this palace? You don’t know your own people. Their disgust for you. Elia Martell raped and murdered, and you did nothing. Oberyn martell butchered, and you did nothing. You’re not a Dornishman. You’re not our prince."
24051,NARRATOR:DORAN is bleeding out on the ground. He gasps for air.
24052,DORAN: My son Trystane…
24053,NARRATOR:ELLARIA scoffs.
24054,ELLARIA: Your son is weak just like you. And weak men will never rule Dorne again.
24055,NARRATOR:DORAN dies.
24056,NARRATOR:TRYSTANE is painting an eye on a stone. OBARA and NYMERIA enter. TRYSTANE does not look at them.
24057,TRYSTANE: I told you I’m not hungry.
24058,OBARA: We’re not here to feed you.
24059,NARRATOR:TRYSTANE stands and turns around to look at them.
24060,OBARA: We’re here to kill you.
24061,NARRATOR:OBARA walks to the opposite side of the room. NYMERIA remains by the door. TRYSTANE reaches for his sword.
24062,NYMERIA: You want her to do it or me?
24063,TRYSTANE: We are family. I don’t want to hurt you.
24064,NYMERIA: Her or me?
24065,NARRATOR:TRYSTANE draws his blade and points it at NYMERIA.
24066,NYMERIA: Good.
24067,OBARA: Smart boy.

24071,TYRION: We’re never going to fix what’s wrong with this city from the top of an 800-foot pyramid.
24072,NARRATOR:VARYS looks over his shoulder at a passing commoner.
24073,TYRION: We’ll be fine. We’re dressed like common merchants.
24074,VARYS: You walk like a rich person.
24075,TYRION: You’ve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk?
24076,VARYS: You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property. I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy.
24077,TYRION: It’s a good thing you’re not a boy anymore...because you have no cock.
24078,NARRATOR:A woman is lying in the street holding a baby. TYRION and VARYS approach.
24079,TYRION (speaking Valyrian): For your baby. To eat.
24080,NARRATOR:The woman cowers away from TYRION.
24081,VARYS (to TYRION): She thinks you want to eat her baby.
24082,NARRATOR:VARYS kneels.
24083,"VARYS (speaking Valyrian): His Valyrian is terrible. He only wants to give you money, so your baby can eat."
24084,"NARRATOR:VARYS hands the woman money. She gestures at them to thank them, and they walk on. They walk into a courtyard where “KILL THE MASTERS” is written in red on a wall. Beneath it, “MHYSA IS A MASTER,” is written."
24085,VARYS: Mhysa means mother in Valyrian.
24086,TYRION: I know what mhysa means.
24087,VARYS: Who wrote it?
24088,TYRION: Hard to know. Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be.
24089,VARYS: The Sons of the Harpy?
24090,"TYRION: Very possibly. Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property, told them human beings weren’t even property to begin with. You can see why they’re unhappy. Of course, it could also be the freed men."
24091,NARRATOR:TYRION and VARYS enter a chamber where a red priest is preaching to a group of listeners.
24092,LISTENERS (speaking Valyrian): For the night is dark and full of terrors.
24093,"RED PRIEST: The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you, and those who love the darkness chased her away."
24094,TYRION: Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them.
24095,VARYS: She did fly away on a dragon and not come back.
24096,"RED PRIEST: How will you respond? Will you wring your hands, while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return? Or will you  you take up her flames yourselves? Will you fight for your own salvation, now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you?"
24097,TYRION: It’s a problem.
24098,NARRATOR:TYRION and VARYS proceed in a much larger courtyard.
24099,"TYRION: Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill. Whoever you are, wherever you go, someone in this city wants to murder you. We can’t fight an enemy we don’t know."
24100,"VARYS: The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully, which means they take orders from someone."
24101,TYRION: And have you started looking for that someone?
24102,"VARYS: My little birds have already taken wing. Soon they’ll return, singing songs of men in gold masks."
24103,"NARRATOR:Men are shouting in the distance. A bell begins to toll. A flood of people run through an archway on the opposite side of the courtyard toward TYRION and VARYS, then run past them. TYRION and VARYS proceed through the archway and into the harbor. Smoke pours from the burning wreckage of all the ships in the harbor."
24104,"TYRION: Well, we won’t be sailing to Westeros anytime soon."
24105,DAARIO: Goat?
24106,JORAH: Ram.
24107,DAARIO: You think our friend got him?
24108,JORAH: Don’t know anything else that can melt a ram’s horn.
24109,"DAARIO: We’re on the right path, then."
24110,NARRATOR:JORAH and DAARIO return to their horses. They proceed across the countryside.
24111,DAARIO: Perhaps she’s tired of being queen. I don’t think she likes it very much.
24112,JORAH: She’s too smart to like it.
24113,"DAARIO: Maybe she’s flown somewhere else, somewhere far away from men like us."
24114,JORAH: I’ve been all over the world. There’s no escaping men like us.
24115,"DAARIO: There’s no escaping her, eh? You keep coming back. Why?"
24116,JORAH: You know why.
24117,DAARIO: isn’t it frustrating wanting someone who doesn’t want you back?
24118,JORAH: Of course it is.
24119,"DAARIO: You’re a romantic. I admire that. Sometimes I look at you and I think, “So that’s what I’ll be like when I grow old.”"
24120,JORAH: If you grow old.
24121,DAARIO: If I grow old. I hope I do. I want to see what the world looks like when she’s done conquering it.
24122,JORAH: So do I.
24123,NARRATOR:JORAH stops his horse. DAARIO proceeds ahead. JORAH pulls back his sleeve and looks at the growing patch of Greyscale on his forearm. The men resume riding in unison. They pull up on a circular swathe of horse tracks. There is a smaller circle of untouched grass in the center of the swathe.
24124,"DAARIO: Huh, an army?"
24125,JORAH: Not an army. A horde.
24126,NARRATOR:JORAH dismounts his horse and walks to the circle of untouched grass.
24127,DAARIO: Dothraki?
24128,NARRATOR:JORAH looks down and sees something in the grass. He bends down and retrieves a ring.
24129,JORAH: They have her.
24130,BLOODRIDER #1: Maybe she saw a ghost. My friend’s mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white.
24131,BLOODRIDER #2: Pink people are afraid of the sun. It burns their skin. This one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white.
24132,BLOODRIDER #1: You think she’s got white pussy hair too? You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair?
24133,BLOODRIDER #2: Only when I was fucking your grandma.
24134,NARRATOR:BLOODRIDER #1 chuckles and makes a kissing sound at DAENERYS.
24135,BLOODRIDER #1 (to DAENERYS): I’ll ask Khal Moro for a night with you. What do you think?
24136,"BLOODRIDER #2: Pretty eyes, but she’s an idiot."
24137,BLOODRIDER #1: She doesn’t have to be smart to get fucked in the ass.
24138,"BLOODRIDER #2: I like to talk when I’m finished. Otherwise, we might as well be dogs."
24139,NARRATOR:The Dothraki folk are tending to their affairs. BLOODRIDER #1 and BLOODRIDER #2 escort DAENERYS to KHAL MORO’s tent. KHAL MORO is sitting with his wives and other bloodriders.
24140,"BLOODRIDER #2: For you, my Khal. The white-haired girl we found in the hills."
24141,NARRATOR:BLOODRIDER #1 pushes DAENERYS towards KHAL MORO. KHAL MORO considers her. The attendants speak in Dothraki.
24142,"BLOODRIDER #3: Look at those lips, blood of my blood."
24143,WIFE #1: Blue-eyed women are witches.
24144,WIFE #2: It is known.
24145,"WIFE#1: Cut off her head, before she casts a spell on you."
24146,NARRATOR:KHAL MORO stands and walks around DAENERYS.
24147,"KHAL MORO: Even if I was blind, I’d hear my wives say, “Cut off her head” and I’d know this woman was beautiful. I’m glad I’m not blind. Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time, what is better than that?"
24148,BLOODRIDER #3: Killing another Khal?
24149,"KHAL MORO: Yes, killing another Khal."
24150,"BLOODRIDER #4: Conquering a city and taking her people as slaves, and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak."

I do things because they feel good. I drink because it feels good. I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him. I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me.

24413,"NARRATOR:SAM holds up a letter. The maester puts down his spectacles and opens his palm. SAM reaches across the table with the letter, offering it to the maester. The maester does not retrieve it. SAM presses himself against the desk, leans further in, and places the letter directly in the maester’s hand. The maester takes the letter, breaks the seal, and reads it."
24414,NARRATOR:The maester looks at SAM and then opens a large book. He flips a few pages.
24415,MAESTER: Oh.
24416,NARRATOR:The maester points his finger to a line of text on the open page.
24417,"MAESTER: According to our records, Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander."
24418,SAM: He died.
24419,MAESTER: We received no report from the maester at Castle Black.
24420,SAM: Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election. He’s since passed away. Which is why I’m here.
24421,MAESTER: This is irregular.
24422,"SAM: Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular."
24423,"NARRATOR:The maester stares blankly at SAM, then picks up a quill and crosses off two lines of text in the open book."
24424,"MAESTER: The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you. In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library. Follow me."
24425,NARRATOR:The maester stands and begins walking away. SAM and GILLY start to follow him. He turns back and looks at GILLY.
24426,MAESTER:  No women or children!
24427,"NARRATOR:The maester turns and walks away. SAM makes several baffled gestures to GILLY and then follows the maester. They enter a small hallway full of books. The maester stops in front of a dark side passage and gestures towards it. SAM starts down the passage. The maester leaves. On his way through, SAM touches several of the books lining the shelves. SAM emerges onto the other side of the passage. The passage opens onto an enormous library with a chandelier dangling from the ceiling that reflects light. SAM gets teary and smiles."
24428,"NARRATOR:JON SNOW is standing behind the high table, staring across the hall. MELISANDRE stands by his side."
24429,"JON SNOW: When we had feasts, our family would sit up here… and I’d sit down there."
24430,NARRATOR:JON SNOW points to the other end of the hall.
24431,"MELISANDRE: Could have been worse, Jon Snow. You had a family. You had feasts."
24432,NARRATOR:JON SNOW chuckles.
24433,"JON SNOW: Aye, you’re right. I was luckier than most."
24434,NARRATOR:DAVOS enters the hall and tosses the charred stag statuette at MELISANDRE. MELISANDRE catches it.
24435,JON SNOW: What is that?
24436,DAVOS: Tell him. Tell him who it belonged to.
24437,MELISANDRE: The Princess Shireen.
24438,DAVOS: Tell him what you did to her. Tell him!
24439,MELISANDRE: We burned her at the stake.
24440,DAVOS: Why?
24441,MELISANDRE: The army was trapped. The horses were dying. It was the only way.
24442,DAVOS: You burned a little girl alive!
24443,MELISANDRE: I only do what my Lord commands!
24444,"DAVOS: If he commands you to burn children, your Lord is evil!"
24445,MELISANDRE: We are standing here because of him. Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it.
24446,DAVOS: I loved that girl like she was my own. She was good. She was kind. And you killed her!
24447,MELISANDRE: So did her father. So did her mother. Her own blood knew it was the only way.
24448,"DAVOS: The only way for what? They all died anyway! You told everyone Stannis was the one. You had him believing it, all of them fooled. And you lied."
24449,MELISANDRE: I didn’t lie. I was wrong.
24450,"DAVOS: Aye, you were wrong. How many died because you were wrong?"
24451,NARRATOR:DAVOS and MELISANDRE stare at each other in silence.
24452,DAVOS (to JON SNOW): I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder. She admits to the crime.
24453,JON SNOW (to MELISANDRE): Do you have anything to say for yourself?
24454,"MELISANDRE: I’ve been ready to die for many years. If the Lord was done with me, so be it, but he’s not. You’ve seen the Night King, Jon Snow. You know the great war is still to come. You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon. And you know I can help you win that war."
24455,NARRATOR:JON SNOW approaches MELISANDRE.
24456,"JON SNOW: Ride south today. If you return to the North, I’ll have you hanged as a murderer."
24457,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE puts the stag statuette down on the high table and begins to walk away. DAVOS moves in her way.
24458,"DAVOS: If you ever come back this way, I will execute you myself."
24459,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE moves past DAVOS and exits.
24460,NARRATOR:JON SNOW stands atop the outer wall watching MELISANDRE ride south on her horse. SANSA appears.
24461,JON SNOW: I’m having the lord’s chamber prepared for you.
24462,SANSA: Mother and Father’s room? You should take it.
24463,JON SNOW: I’m not a Stark.
24464,SANSA: You are to me.
24465,JON SNOW: You’re the Lady of Winterfell. You deserve it. We’re standing here because of you. The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in. They came because of you. You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons.
24466,SANSA: He did.
24467,JON SNOW: And you trust him?
24468,"SANSA: Only a fool would trust Littlefinger. I should have told you about him, about the Knights of the Vale. I’m sorry."
24469,NARRATOR:JON SNOW approaches SANSA.
24470,JON SNOW: We need to trust each other. We can’t fight a war amongst ourselves. We have so many enemies now.
24471,"NARRATOR:JON SNOW touches SANSA’s face and kisses her on the forehead, then turns to walk away."
24472,SANSA: Jon.
24473,NARRATOR:JON SNOW turns back to face SANSA.
24474,SANSA: A raven came from the Citadel. A white raven. Winter is here.
24475,NARRATOR:JON SNOW smiles and looks up at the sky.
24476,"JON SNOW: Well, Father always promised, didn’t he?"
24477,NARRATOR:JON SNOW exits. SANSA looks out at the wilderness.
24478,"OLENNA: The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne, he was assassinated. 100 red scorpions, was it?"
24479,"ELLARIA: You have nothing to fear from us, Lady Olenna."
24480,"OLENNA: You murder your own prince, but you expect me to trust you?"
24481,OBARA: We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help. You came to Dorne because you needed our help?
24482,OLENNA: What is your name again? Barbaro?
24483,OBARA: Obara.
24484,OLENNA: Obara. You look like an angry little boy. Don’t presume to tell me what I need.
24485,"NYMERIA: Forgive my sister. What she lacks in diplomacy, she makes--"
24486,"OLENNA: Do shut up, dear."
24487,NARRATOR:OLENNA looks at TYENE.
24488,OLENNA: Anything from you?
24489,NARRATOR:TYENE opens her mouth to speak.
24490,OLENNA: No? Good. Let the grown women speak.
24491,ELLARIA: The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell. They have declared war on Dorne. We must be allies now if we wish to survive.
24492,OLENNA: Cersei stole the future from me. She killed my son. She killed my grandson. She killed my granddaughter. Survival is not what I’m after now.
24493,ELLARIA: You’re absolutely right. I chose the wrong words. It is not survival I offer. It is your heart’s desire.
24494,NARRATOR:ELLARIA rings a bell.
24495,OLENNA: And what is my heart’s desire?
24496,ELLARIA: Vengeance. Justice.
24497,NARRATOR:VARYS emerges from a hallway.
24498,VARYS: Fire and blood.
24499,DAARIO: Your ships are nearly ready. I saw them painting the sails.
24500,NARRATOR:DAARIO pours himself a glass of wine.
24501,DAARIO: I’m curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water.
24502,DAENERYS: You’re not coming with us.
24503,"DAARIO: New strategy? You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast? If we take Casterly Rock, the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit King’s Landing."
24504,NARRATOR:DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and stands in front of her.
24505,DAENERYS: You’re not going to Westeros. You’re staying here with the Second Sons. There’s finally peace in Meereen. You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders.
24506,NARRATOR:DAARIO sets his glass of wine down on a table.
24507,"DAARIO: Fuck Meereen. Fuck the people. I’m here for you, not them."
24508,"DAENERYS: You promised me. “My sword is yours. My life is yours.” This is what I command. If I’m going to rule in Westeros, I’ll need to make alliances. The best way to make alliances is with marriage."
24509,NARRATOR:DAARIO sits down.
24510,DAARIO: Who are you marrying this time?
24511,DAENERYS: I don’t know. Maybe no one.
24512,DAARIO: But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table? Are you a queen or fish bait?
24513,DAENERYS: I can’t bring a lover to Westeros.
24514,DAARIO: A king wouldn’t think twice about it.
24515,DAENERYS: So that’s what you want? To be my mistress?
24516,DAARIO: I’m not proud. I don’t care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room. I don’t want a crown. I want you.
24517,NARRATOR:DAARIO approaches DAENERYS and kneels in front of her.
24518,DAARIO: I love you. And I make you happy. You know I do. Bring me with you. Let me fight for you.
24519,NARRATOR:DAENERYS touches DAARIO’s face.
24520,DAENERYS: I can’t.
24521,NARRATOR:DAARIO stands.
24522,DAARIO: The dwarf told you to do this.
24523,DAENERYS: No one tells me to do anything.
24524,DAARIO: Clever fellow. Can’t argue with his logic. I’m no use to you over there.
24525,DAENERYS: Don’t get angry.
24526,"DAARIO: I’m not angry. I’m full of self-pity. Who comes after you? Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn, the Mother of Dragons?"
24527,"DAENERYS: A great number of women, I imagine. Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons."
24528,NARRATOR:DAENERYS stands.
24529,DAARIO: Bay of Dragons?
24530,"DAENERYS: We can’t call it Slaver’s Bay anymore, can we?"
24531,"DAARIO: You’ll get that throne you want so badly, I’m sure of it. I hope it brings you happiness."
24532,NARRATOR:DAARIO sips his wine.
24533,DAARIO: I pity the lord of Westeros. They have no idea what’s coming for them.
24534,"DAENERYS: Farewell, Daario Naharis."
24535,NARRATOR:DAARIO nods and exits.
24536,"NARRATOR:TYRION is sitting off to the side of the room on a bench. DAENERYS enters, walking down the steps from the throne."
24537,TYRION: How did he take it?
24538,DAENERYS: No tears.
24539,"TYRION: I know it was hard for you. You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms. That’s the kind of self-sacrifice that makes for a good ruler, if it’s any consolation."
24540,NARRATOR:DAENERYS reaches the bottom of the steps and approaches TYRION.
24541,DAENERYS: It’s not.
24542,"TYRION: No, I suppose not. I’m terrible at consoling."
24543,NARRATOR:DAENERYS sits down on the bench next to TYRION.
24544,"DAENERYS: Yes, you really are."
24545,"TYRION: All right, how about the fact that this is actually happening? You have your armies, you have your ships, you have your dragons. Everything you’ve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything. It’s all yours for the taking. Are you afraid?"
24546,NARRATOR:DAENERYS nods.
24547,TYRION: Good. You’re in the great game now. And the great game’s terrifying. The only people who aren’t afraid of failure are madmen like your father.
24548,DAENERYS: Do you know what frightens me? I said farewell to a man who loves me. A man I thought I cared for. And I felt nothing. Just impatient to get on with it.
24549,TYRION: He wasn’t the first to love you and he won’t be the last.
24550,"DAENERYS: Well, you have completely failed to console me."
24551,NARRATOR:DAENERYS stands and turns to face TYRION.
24552,NARRATOR:TYRION stands on the bench.
24553,"TYRION: I believe in you. It’s embarrassing, really. I’d swear you my sword, but I don’t actually own a sword."
24554,DAENERYS: It’s your counsel I need.
24555,TYRION: It’s yours. Now and always.
24556,"DAENERYS: Good. I, um… I had something made for you. I’m not sure if it’s right."
24557,NARRATOR:DAENERYS pins a Hand of the King’s brooch on TYRION’s chest.
24558,"DAENERYS: Tyrion Lannister, I name you Hand of the Queen."
24559,"NARRATOR:TYRION holds back tears, then kneels."
24560,"NARRATOR:INT. THE TWINSWALDER FREY is sitting at the high table, eating and drinking. The rest of the dining hall is empty. A handmaiden approaches and sets down a platter of pie on the table in front of him."
24561,"WALDER: You’re not one of mine, are you?"
24562,"HANDMAIDEN: No, my lord."
24563,WALDER: Didn’t think so. Too pretty.
24564,NARRATOR:WALDER slaps the handmaiden on the buttocks and smiles.
24565,WALDER: Where are my damn moron sons? Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday.
24566,"HANDMAIDEN: They’re here, my lord."
24567,"WALDER: Well, what are they doing, trimming their cunt hairs? Tell them to come here now."
24568,"HANDMAIDEN: But they’re already here, my lord."
24569,NARRATOR:WALDER looks around the hall. The handmaiden points to the pie.
24570,"HANDMAIDEN: Here, my lord."
24571,NARRATOR:WALDER pulls back the top layer of the pie. A finger protrudes from the center of the slice.
24572,HANDMAIDEN: They weren’t easy to carve. Especially Black Walder.
24573,NARRATOR:WALDER breathes heavily.
24574,WALDER: What…
24575,"NARRATOR:The handmaiden reaches up to her face and pulls it away, revealing her true identity is ARYA."
24576,ARYA: My name is Arya Stark. I want you to know that. The last thing you’re ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die.
24577,"NARRATOR:ARYA brandishes a knife. WALDER gets up to run, but ARYA grabs him and pulls him back down. She grabs him by the forehead and slits his throat. He convulses and groans as he dies. ARYA smiles and stares at him."
24578,"PETYR: Forgive me, my lady… if you’re at prayer."
24579,"SANSA: I’m done with all that. I came here every day when I was a girl. I prayed to be somewhere else. Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted, never about what I had."
24580,NARRATOR:SANSA stands and walks towards PETYR.
24581,SANSA: I was a stupid girl.
24582,PETYR: You were a child.
24583,SANSA: What do you want?
24584,PETYR: I thought you knew what I wanted.
24585,SANSA: I was wrong.
24586,"PETYR: No, you weren’t. Every time I’m faced with a decision, I close my eyes and see the same picture. Whenever I consider an action, I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality? Pull it out of my mind and into the world? And I only act if the answer is yes. A picture of me on the Iron Throne… and you by my side."
24587,"NARRATOR:PETYR leans in to kiss SANSA, but SANSA puts her hand on his chest to stop him."
24588,SANSA: It’s a pretty picture.
24589,NARRATOR:SANSA walks past PETYR.
24590,PETYR: News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms. I’ve declared for House Stark for all to hear.
24591,"SANSA: You’ve declared for other houses before, Lord Baelish. It’s never stopped you from serving yourself."
24592,"PETYR: The past is gone for good. You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future. You, my love, are the future of House Stark. Who should the North rally behind? A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south?"
24593,NARRATOR:SANSA exits.
24594,NARRATOR:EXT. BEYOND THE WALLBENJEN stares up at The Wall. BRAN and MEERA wait nearby.
24595,BENJEN: This is where I leave you.
24596,MEERA: You’re not coming with us?
24597,"BENJEN: The Wall is not just ice and stone. Ancient spells were carved into its foundations. Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond. And while it stands, the dead cannot pass. I cannot pass."
24598,"NARRATOR:BENJEN approaches his horse and lifts BRAN off of it. He carries BRAN to the foot of a nearby weirwood, then walks back to his horse."
24599,MEERA: Where will you go?
24600,BENJEN: The great war is coming and I still fight for the living. I’ll do what I can… as long as I can.
24601,NARRATOR:BENJEN mounts his horse.
24602,"BRAN: Thank you, Uncle Benjen."
24603,BENJEN: I wish you both good fortune.
24604,NARRATOR:BENJEN rides away. BRAN looks at the weirwood and then starts to crawl towards it. MEERA helps him. BRAN reaches out to the weirwood but MEERA grabs his wrist.

24625,NED: Get her some water!

24627,NED: Is there a maester?
24628,"LYANNA: Please. Listen to me, Ned."
24629,NARRATOR:LYANNA whispers in NED’s ear.

24637,NARRATOR:JON SNOW stands.
24638,"JON SNOW: The free folk, the northerners, and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely, fought together, and we won. My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield."
24639,NARRATOR:One of the houses’ representatives stands.
24640,"MAN: The Boltons are defeated. The war is over. Winter has come. If the maesters are right, it’ll be the coldest one in a thousand years. We should ride home and wait out the coming storms."
24641,"JON SNOW: The war is not over. And I promise you, friend, the true enemy won’t wait out the storm. He brings the storm."
24642,NARRATOR:The men begin to murmur. LYANNA MORMONT stands.
24643,"LYANNA: Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding, Lord Manderly. But you refused the call. You swore allegiance to House Stark, Lord Glover, but in their hour of greatest need, you refused the call. And you, Lord Cerwyn, your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton. Still you refuse the call. But House Mormont remembers. The North remembers. We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark. I don’t care if he’s a bastard. Ned Stark’s blood runs through his veins. He’s my king from this day until his last day."
24644,NARRATOR:The men resume murmuring. LORD MANDERLY stands.
24645,"MANDERLY: Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly. My son died for Robb Stark, the Young Wolf. I didn’t think we’d find another king in my lifetime. I didn’t commit my men to your cause ‘cause I didn’t want more Manderlys dying for nothing. But I was wrong. Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding. He is the White Wolf. The King in the North."
24646,"NARRATOR:MANDERLY draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels. LORD GLOVER stands."
24647,GLOVER: I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day. A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness.
24648,"JON SNOW: There’s nothing to forgive, my lord."
24649,GLOVER: There will be more fights to come. House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years. And I will stand behind Jon Snow… the King in the North!
24650,"NARRATOR:GLOVER draws his blade, then rests it point-down on the ground and kneels."

24958,THEON: We shouldn’t be lighting fires. It’s not safe. He won’t stop hunting us.
24959,"SANSA: We just have to make it to Castle Black. Once we’re with Jon, Ramsay won’t be able to touch us."
24960,THEON: Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate.
24961,SANSA: I won’t let him. I’ll tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon.
24962,"THEON: And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place? The truth about Ser Rodrik, who I beheaded?"
24963,NARRATOR:SANSA looks to the ground.
24964,"THEON: And the truth about Rob, who I betrayed?"
24965,"SANSA: When you take the black, all your crimes are forgiven."
24966,THEON: I don’t want to be forgiven. I can never make amends to your family for all the things that I’ve done. They’ll keep you safer than I ever could.
24967,SANSA: You’re not coming with us?
24968,THEON: I would have taken you all the way to the Wall. I would have died to get you there.
24969,NARRATOR:SANSA hugs THEON. They both cry.

24976,BALON: And the Ironborn who held it?
24977,YARA: They died fighting to a man.
24978,BALON: What is dead may never die.
24979,YARA: What is dead may never die.
24980,NARRATOR:YARA places the piece of paper she was reading from on a table.
24981,YARA: But they did and our invasion died with them. Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland.

24983,YARA: Why? For more pinecones and rocks?
24984,NARRATOR:BALON turns around to face YARA.

24986,"YARA: We can defeat anyone at sea, but we’ll never hold lands and castles against mainland armies."
24987,NARRATOR:BALON walks to YARA.
24988,"BALON: Not if our captains defy my orders, abandon their posts, and sacrifice our men on foolish mission."
24989,YARA: I won’t apologize for trying to rescue Theon.
24990,BALON: Then where is he?
24991,"YARA: Where is your kingdom? We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war. That war is over. The last time we provoked them too far, I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers. I lost two brothers that day."
24992,"BALON: And I lost three sons. The War of the Five Kings, they call it. Well, the other four are dead. When you rule the Iron Islands, you can wage all the peace you wan. But for now, shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will."
24993,NARRATOR:BALON exits the hall.
24994,"NARRATOR:Rain is pouring down. BALON begins to cross the unsteady bridge. He leans on the ropes and looks down at the ocean, then sees a cloaked figure on the other side of the bridge."
24995,"BALON: Let me pass. You fool, move aside for your king."
24996,"HOODED FIGURE: Haven’t I always, brother?"
24997,"NARRATOR:The hooded figure takes off his hood, revealing his identity. He is EURON GREYJOY. BALON walks a few steps closer."
24998,BALON: I thought you’d be rotting under some foreign sea by now.
24999,EURON: What is dead may never die.
25000,NARRATOR:BALON does not respond.
25001,EURON: Has the custom changed since I’ve been gone? Aren’t you supposed to repeat the words?
25002,BALON: You can mock our god without my help.
25003,"EURON: I don’t mock the Drowned God. I am the Drowned God. From Oldtown to Qarth, when men see my sails, they pray."
25004,NARRATOR:The wind buffets the bridge back and forth. BALON tries to hold his balance. EURON chuckles.
25005,"EURON: You’re old, brother. You've had your time. Now let another rule."
25006,NARRATOR:BALON walks towards his brother.
25007,BALON: I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea. They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.
25008,EURON: They did.
25009,"BALON: And when the storm passed, you cut out their tongues."
25010,EURON: I needed silence.
25011,BALON: What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm?
25012,"EURON: I am the storm, brother. The first storm and the last. And you’re in my way."
25013,NARRATOR:BALON draws a knife and slashes EURON across the face. EURON throws BALON off the bridge. BALON falls to his death.
25014,"NARRATOR:Many Ironborn are in attendance for BALON's funeral. AERON GREYJOY and several Drowned Men are gathered around BALON's body.

25015,"AERON: Lord, take your servant Balon back beneath the waves. Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh. Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children."
25016,ALL: What is dead may never die.
25017,YARA: I’m going to find out who did this. I’m going to feed them to the sharks while they live. I swear it by the Salt Throne.
25018,"AERON: The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon, not unless the kingsmoot chooses you."
25019,YARA: My father would’ve wanted me to rule.
25020,AERON: Your father does not get to choose. The law is clear. Perhaps you'll win. Perhaps you’ll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn. And perhaps not.
25021,MELISANDRE: Come in.
25022,NARRATOR:DAVOS enters.

25031,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.
25032,MELISANDRE: What are you asking?
25033,DAVOS: Do you know of any magic...that could help him? Bring him back?
25034,"MELISANDRE: If you want to help him, leave him be."
25035,DAVOS: Can it be done?
25036,MELISANDRE: There are some with his power.
25037,DAVOS: How?
25038,MELISANDRE: I don’t know.
25039,DAVOS: Have you seen it done?
25040,DAVOS: But it was. It could be now.
25041,MELISANDRE: Not for me.
25042,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE stands and walks away from her chair. DAVOS walks towards her.
25043,DAVOS: Not for you? I saw you drink poison that should’ve killed you. I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows.
25044,"MELISANDRE: Everything I believed, the great victory I saw in the flames, all of it was a lie."
25045,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE looks at DAVOS.
25046,MELISANDRE: You were right all along. The Lord never spoke to me.
25047,"DAVOS: Fuck him, then. Fuck all of them. I’m not a devout man, obviously. Seven Gods, drowned gods, tree gods, it's all the same."
25048,NARRATOR:DAVOS comes a step closer to MELISANDRE
25049,DAVOS: I’m not asking the Lord of Light for help.I’m asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist.
25050,MELISANDRE: I never had this gift.
25051,DAVOS: Have you ever tried?
25052,"NARRATOR:DAVOS, TORMUND, DOLOROUS EDD, and MELISANDRE are gathered around JON SNOW's body. GHOST is sleeping on the floor. MELISANDRE is performing a ritual on JON SNOW's body. She wrings out a wet cloth with which she cleans out the wounds of JON SNOW. She cuts his hair and beard and throws the hairs in a firepit. Then she places her hands on JON SNOW's chest and utters an incantation in Valyrian. She sighs."

25063,"MELISANDRE: Afterwards, after they stabbed you, after you died, where did you go? What did you see?"
25064,JON SNOW: Nothing. There was nothing at all.
25065,"MELISANDRE: The Lord let you come back for a reason. Stannis was not the prince who was promised, but someone has to be."
25066,DAVOS (to MELISANDRE): Could you give us a moment?
25067,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE rises and exits the room. DAVOS closes the door behind her, grabs a stool, and sits down in front of JON SNOW."
25068,"DAVOS: You were dead. And now you’re not. That’s completely fucking mad, seems to me. I can only imagine how it seems to you."
25069,JON SNOW: I did what I thought was right. And I got murdered for it. And now I’m back. Why?
25070,DAVOS: I don’t know. Maybe we’ll never know. What does it matter? You go on. You fight for as long as you can. You clean up as much of the shit as you can.
25071,"JON SNOW: I don’t know how to do that. I thought I did, but...I failed."
25072,DAVOS: Good. Now go fail again.

The men on either side part to let him pass. TORMUND walks up the middle to confront JON SNOW."
25074,TORMUND: They think you’re some kind of god. The man who returned from the dead.
25075,JON SNOW: I’m not a god.
25076,TORMUND: I know that.
25077,NARRATOR:TORMUND moves closer to JON SNOW and whispers in his ear.
25078,TORMUND: I saw your pecker. What kind of god would have a pecker that small?
25079,"NARRATOR:JON SNOW and TORMUND both chuckle and embrace. JON SNOW winces, then spies DOLOROUS EDD and begins walking towards him. They embrace, and JON SNOW winces again."
25080,DOLOROUS EDD: Your eyes are still brown. Is that still you in there?

25086,GILLY: You all right?
25087,"SAMWELL: Yes. Yes, I’m fine."
25088,GILLY: Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see?
25089,SAMWELL: I don’t think so.
25090,"GILLY: Sea, see. They’re spelled different, but they sound the same."

25096,GILLY: Won’t be long. We’ll be in the south soon. I’m excited to see Oldtown. Captain says it’s the most beautiful city in Westeros. Are you going to vomit again?
25097,"SAMWELL: No. No, no, no. The Citadel doesn’t admit women. There won’t be a place for you there or for Little Sam."
25098,GILLY: I stayed at Castle Black. There’s no women allowed there.
25099,SAMWELL: The Citadel isn’t Castle Black. I don’t have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules.

25107,"SAMWELL: I don’t care about them. Well, no, I do, but I don’t really. I care about you and him."
25108,"GILLY: I know that, Sam. And he does, too. You're the only one who ever has."
25109,NARRATOR:GILLY places her hand on SAMWELL’s back.
25110,"GILLY: If you think it’s for the best, we trust you."
25111,SAMWELL: I’d feel better if you threw something at me and stormed off.
25112,GILLY: I’d never do that to the father of my son.

25155,BRAN: What’s in that tower? I want to go back there.
25156,"THREE-EYED RAVEN: I’ve told you many times, stay too long where you don’t belong and you will never return."
25157,BRAN: Why do I want to return? So I can be a cripple again? So I can talk to an old man in a tree?
25158,"THREE-EYED RAVEN: You think I wanted to sit here for 1,000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me?"
25159,BRAN: So why did you?
25160,THREE-EYED RAVEN: I was waiting for you.

25173,DAENERYS: You have made a mistake. One you will regret. I am the wife of the Great Khal.
25174,DOTHRAKI MATRON: We know who you are. I remember you eating the stallion’s heart. Why didn’t you come to us after Khal Drogo died?
25175,"DAENERYS: Because I am Daenerys Stormborn, the Breaker of Chains, the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons. My place is not here with you."
25176,"DOTHRAKI MATRON: You were the wife of the Great Khal. You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side. He didn’t. I was the wife of the Great Khal. Khal Savo. I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side. You’re young. We were all young once. But we all understand the way things are. You will learn as well, if you are fortunate enough to stay with us."
25177,DAENERYS: Where else would I go? Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen.
25178,"DOTHRAKI MATRON: Yes. Immediately after the death of their khal. But you went out into the world. That is forbidden. All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven. They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved. And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogo’s silver-haired widow. With luck, your place will be here with us, Mother of Dragons. It is the best you can hope for, now."

25189,NARRATOR:VARYS approaches the woman.
25190,"VARYS: And it does provide answers. But they’re usually the wrong answers. My job is to find the right answers. Do you know how I do that? I do it by making people happy. I’d like to make you happy, Vala. That’s your name, isn’t it, Vala?"
25191,NARRATOR:VALA looks away. VARYS chuckles.
25192,"VARYS: That’s all right. I know who you are and what you’ve done. You’ve done a lot. You’ve sacrificed your body for a cause, which is more than most people do. And you’ve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons."
25193,VALA: The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history.
25194,"VALA: Yes, you’re a true liberator, aren’t you? You won’t torture me, you’ll just threaten my son."
25195,"VARYS: Children are blameless. I have never hurt them. Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you. But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen’s soldiers. We both know the penalty for that crime. How will poor Dom get on without his mother? And with his breathing problem."
25196,"VALA: If I tell you anything, they’ll kill me. So either you kill me or they do."
25197,"VARYS: Yes, from your perspective, this is a problem. There is a third option, though. A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos. I’ve already booked passage for a woman and her young son. I’ll even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again."
25198,NARRATOR:VARYS kicks a large brown bag at his feet.
25199,VARYS: Though I’m afraid we’ll have to ask one of our leather-clad friends back in to carry it. Far too heavy for me. The boat sails at dawn. You need to decide now. A new life for you and Dom or…

25205,"TYRION: You two, you spend a great deal of time together. What would you be talking about if I weren’t here?"
25206,GREY WORM: Patrol. When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied. What we see on patrol. Who we captured on patrol.
25207,TYRION: That’s good. That’s very good.
25208,NARRATOR:TYRION stands and carries his wine glass over to the decanter to refill it.
25209,TYRION: But that’s a report. I was thinking more of a conversation. A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms.
25210,MISSANDEI: Who said this?
25211,"TYRION: Me. Just now. All right, no conversations. Let’s play a game."
25212,NARRATOR:TYRION returns to the table. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI say nothing.
25213,"TYRION: You don’t play games, either one of you, ever?"
25214,GREY WORM: Games are for children.
25215,MISSANDEI: My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games.
25216,"TYRION: There, that’s a start."
25217,MISSANDEI: Only the girls.
25218,"TYRION: Oh no, no, no. Not that, of course not that. Innocent games, fun games, drinking games."
25219,MISSANDEI: We do not drink.
25220,TYRION: Until you do.
25221,NARRATOR:GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look interrogatively at TYRION.
25222,NARRATOR:VARYS enters the room.
25223,"TYRION: Oh, you took your time."
25224,VARYS: Sorry. I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy. Some things you can’t rush.
25225,MISSANDEI: You found out?
25226,VARYS: The good masters of Astapor. And the wise masters of Yunkai. With help from their friends in Volantis.
25227,TYRION: You see? You don’t even have to worry about the local rebellion. We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it.
25228,GREY WORM: We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once. We will do it again and execute the Masters.
25229,"TYRION: If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai, who remain to defend the free people of Meereen?"
25230,"GREY WORM: If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?"
25231,"MISSANDEI: We cannot. The Masters only speak one language. They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue. If we want them to hear us, we must speak it back to them. May it be the last thing they ever hear."
25232,NARRATOR:TYRION nods.
25233,TYRION: You may be right.
25234,GREY WORM: So we will fight them?
25235,TYRION: Possibly.
25236,MISSANDEI: Possibly?
25237,TYRION: It’s a conversation.
25238,NARRATOR:TYRION turns to VARYS.
25239,"TYRION: Tell me, can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor, the wise Masters of Yunkai, the benevolent enslavers of Volantis?"
25240,"VARYS: Of course. Man can be fickle, but birds always trust."
25241,NARRATOR:A group of Varys' child spies are gathered together. One LITTLE BIRD picks up a model of a planet. Another child plays with an hourglass.
25242,"QYBURN: Your eye looks much better, Arthur. How’s your mother’s jaw?"
25243,ARTHUR: Better.
25244,QYBURN: And your father?
25245,ARTHUR: No one’s seen him.
25246,QYBURN: And no one will. That worked out rather nicely.
25247,LITTLE BIRD: Will Lord Varys ever come back?
25248,QYBURN: I don’t think so. Do you miss him?
25249,LITTLE BIRD: He was nice.
25250,ARTHUR: He called us his little birds. He gave us sweets.
25251,NARRATOR:QYBURN stands up and walks to a table.
25252,QYBURN: It’s funny you should mention that. Guess what I happened to find today. Candied plums from Dorne.
25253,NARRATOR:He nods at the boxes. Eeach child picks one. They nibble at the plums.
25254,"QYBURN: Now remember, if any of your friends like sweets or need help, they can always come to me. All I need in return are whispers."

25259,NARRATOR:The children run up the stairs.
25260,CERSEI: Varys's little birds?
25261,"QYBURN: Your little birds now, your Grace."
25262,NARRATOR:JAIME is admiring GREGOR.
25263,JAIME: What did you do to him exactly? I haven't been able to get a clear answer.
25264,"QYBURN: Oh, a number of things."
25265,"JAIME: Does he understand what we’re saying? I mean, to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place."
25266,NARRATOR:GREGOR turns his head to JAIME. JAIME recoils.
25267,QYBURNS: He understands well enough.
25268,JAIME: So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrow’s head like a melon.
25269,CERSEI: The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him. Ser Gregor will can’t face them all. And he won’t have to. He’ll only have to face one.
25270,JAIME: Has the Faith leveled official charges yet?
25271,CERSEI: Not yet.
25272,JAIME: That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching.
25273,"CERSEI (to QYBURN): Don’t stop at the city. I want little birds in Dorne, in Highgarden, in the North. If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it. If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit, I want to hear. I want to know who they are. I want to where they are."
25274,NARRATOR:QYBURN bows his head to CERSEI.

25276,"MAESTER PYCELLE: As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was, Qyburn is worse. I told them all. I told them. He’s arrogant, dangerous. You don’t get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason. And no one listened to my advice, so here we are."
25277,"NARRATOR:JAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR enter the room."
25278,"MAESTER PYCELLE: And what he's done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination. We never sanctioned this, this experiment. And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest --"
25279,NARRATOR:MAESTER PYCELLE notices the new guests. He farts.
25280,KEVAN: Can I help you?
25281,CERSEI (to LADY OLENNA): Why are you here?
25282,MACE TYRELL: My mother...
25283,"LADY OLENNA: I was invited, my dear, o help deal with several troublesome issues, such as the queen’s imprisonment."
25284,CERSEI: Thank you for bringing it up. It’s well past time we addressed the abuses I endured.
25285,LADY OLENNA: Margaery is the queen. You are not the queen because you’re not married to the king. I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family.
25286,KEVAN (to CERSEI & company): This is a Small Council meeting. You have no position on the Small Council.
25287,JAIME: I’m Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council.
25288,"CERSEI: Grand Maester Pycelle, would you sanction that statement?"
25289,"MAESTER PYCELLE: Well, um...I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad King’s council. Of course, that was the Mad King. King Robert saw things differently."

25291,"CERSEI (to KEVAN): What about Myrcella’s death, Uncle? Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?"
25292,JAIME: The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne. We've got a lot to discuss. All of us together.
25293,"CERSEI: And seeing as you cannot make us leave, we best get on with it."
25294,"KEVAN: No, we cannot make you leave. And you cannot make us stay. Not unless you're gonna have that thing murder us all."
25295,"NARRATOR:One by one, KEVAN LANNISTER, LADY OLENNA and MACE TYRELL leave the room. MAESTER PYCELLE picks up his paperwork and shuffles slowly. He then runs out of the door when SER GREGOR looks at him threateningly. JAIME, CERSEI and SER GREGOR are left alone in the room."

25299,"HIGH SPARROW: Oh, I'm, sorry, your Grace. That’s not possible. Not yet."
25300,TOMMEN: When will it be possible?
25301,HIGH SPARROW: When she's fully atoned for her sins.
25302,TOMMEN: You’ve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city. That wasn’t a full atonement?
25303,"HIGH SPARROW: No. She must stand trial before seven septons, so we can learn the true extant of her sins."
25304,TOMMEN: I want you to let her see Myrcella’s resting place.
25305,NARRATOR:Several Faith Militant gather behind the HIGH SPARROW.
25306,TOMMEN: I am the king.
25307,HIGH SPARROW: You are.
25308,TOMMEN: And what does that mean to you?
25309,HIGH SPARROW: It means a great deal to me. The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world. Do you know who told me that? Your mother.
25310,NARRATOR:TOMMEN walks closer to the HIGH SPARROW. He guards tense.
25311,TOMMEN: My mother who is unclean? My mother who still needs to atone after all you’ve put her through?
25312,NARRATOR:The HIGH SPARROW signs that his guards need to leave. They leave. TOMMEN puts his hand in the air and points to his guards. They leave. HIGH SPARROW closes the book lying on the table behind him.
25313,"HIGH SPARROW: How do you think the Mother Above first came to us? How did men and women first come to feel the Mother’s presence? It was through their own mothers. There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei, you know that. But when she speaks of you, the Mother’s love outshines it all. Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world. Because it doesn’t come from this world. But you know that. You’ve felt it. You’ve seen her when she talks to you."
25314,TOMMEN: Yes.
25315,HIGH SPARROW: It’s a great gift. One I never had. Envy. One more thing for me to atone for.
25316,NARRATOR:HIGH SPARROW points to a bench in the room.
25317,"HIGH SPARROW: You Grace, may I? Do you mind? It's my knees."
25318,TOMMEN: Of course.
25319,NARRATOR:HIGH SPARROW sighs and sits down.
25320,"HIGH SPARROW: When your mother made her walk of atonement, she did it to get back to you."
25321,TOMMEN: I still don’t understand why you want to put her through any more than she's already endured.
25322,HIGH SPARROW: It’s not what I want. It’s what the gods want. They make their will known to us and it’s up to us to either accept or reject it.
25323,NARRATOR:The HIGH SPARROW palms the seat next to him.
25324,HIGH SPARROW: Please.
25325,NARRATOR:TOMMEN sits down next to him.
25326,"HIGH SPARROW: If we’re to be just and good, then we accept it, all of us, even kings. A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can. And no one is wiser than the gods."
25327,TOMMEN: My grandfather once said something similar. Except for the part about the gods.
25328,HIGH SPARROW: The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not. As they work through your mother. There’s so much good in all of us. The best we can do is to help each other bring it out.

25390,SMALLJON: Mmm.
25391,"RAMSAY: Why have you come to Winterfell, Lord Umber?"
25392,"SMALLJON: The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall.  We’re farther north than any of you fuckers. Wildlings come down, we always have to fight them first.  I like fighting wildlings, been doing it all my life.  But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone."
25393,RAMSAY: So now you’ve come seeking help?

25476,SANSA: Where will we go?
25477,"JON SNOW: I can’t stay here, not after what happened."
25478,SANSA: There’s only one place we can go. Home.
25479,JON SNOW: Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave?
25480,SANSA: We’ll take it back from them.
25481,JON SNOW: I don’t have an army.
25482,SANSA: How many wildlings did you save?
25483,JON SNOW: They didn’t come here to serve me.
25484,SANSA: They owe you their lives.
25485,NARRATOR:SANSA stands and walks to a table. She places her bowl down on it.
25486,SANSA: You think they’ll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?
25487,JON SNOW: Sansa.
25488,"SANSA: Winterfell is our home. It’s ours and Arya’s and Bran’s and Rickon’s. Wherever they are, it belongs to our family. We have to fight for it."
25489,JON SNOW: I’m tired of fighting.
25490,NARRATOR:JON SNOW stands and turns to face SANSA.
25491,JON SNOW: It’s all I’ve done since I left home. I’ve killed brothers of the Night’s Watch. I’ve killed wildlings. I’ve killed men that I admire. I hanged a boy younger than Bran. I fought and I lost.
25492,"SANSA: If we don’t take back the North, we’ll never be safe. I want you to help me. But I’ll do it myself if I have to."
25493,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE is looking out over the edge of the balcony. DAVOS approaches her.
25494,DAVOS: My lady.
25495,MELISANDRE: Ser Davos.
25496,DAVOS: Will you stay here at Castle Black?
25497,MELISANDRE: I will do as Jon Snow commands.
25498,DAVOS: You serve Jon Snow now?
25499,MELISANDRE: He’s the prince that was promised.
25500,"DAVOS: Forgive me, my lady, I thought that was Stannis."
25501,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE walks away from DAVOS and down into the courtyard. DAVOS follows her.
25502,DAVOS: What happened down there?
25503,MELISANDRE: There was a battle. Stannis was defeated.
25504,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE continues to walk away, but DAVOS grabs her arm to stop her."
25505,DAVOS: And Shireen? What happened to the princess?
25506,NARRATOR:BRIENNE approaches.
25507,BRIENNE:  I saw what happened. I saw Stannis’ forces defeated in the field.
25508,"DAVOS: My lady, I’m Ser Davos Seaworth."
25509,BRIENNE: We’ve met before. I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon. Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic.
25510,NARRATOR:BRIENNE stares at MELISANDRE.
25511,DAVOS: That’s in the past now.
25512,"BRIENNE: Yes, it’s in the past. It doesn’t mean I forget. Or forgive. He admitted it, you know."
25513,DAVOS: Who did?
25514,BRIENNE: Stannis. Just before I executed him.
25515,NARRATOR:BRIENNE walks away. MELISANDRE walks in the opposite direction. DAVOS stares at BRIENNE.
25516,LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): The Defender of the Vale!
25517,ROBIN: Uncle Petyr!
25518,NARRATOR:ROBIN drops the bow and arrow and runs to LITTLEFINGER. They embrace.
25519,LITTLEFINGER: My lord. Come and see.
25520,NARRATOR:LITTLEFINGER ushers ROBIN to the rear of the carriage.
25521,LITTLEFINGER: I missed your name day. Go on.
25522,"NARRATOR:ROBIN and LITTLEFINGER pull a sheet from the back of the carriage, revealing a cage with a falcon inside. The falcon squawks. ROBIN gasps."
25523,ROBIN: A falcon!
25524,LITTLEFINGER: A gyrfalcon. The greatest and rarest of birds.
25525,"YOHN ROYCE: Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers."
25526,LITTLEFINGER: Indeed I was.
25527,"YOHN ROYCE: And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell."
25528,"LITTLEFINGER: On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting."
25529,YOHN ROYCE: Do you take me for a fool?
25530,"LITTLEFINGER: Tell me, Lord Royce, how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark? I shared my intentions with you and no one else."
25531,NARRATOR:The ensuing conversation momentarily distracts ROBIN from admiring the falcon. YOHN ROYCE approaches LITTLEFINGER slowly.
25532,"YOHN ROYCE: Slander a man in his own home, you might find yourself crossing swords with him."
25533,LITTLEFINGER: Your home is the Vale. The Lord of the Vale stands before us. And only his judgment concerns me.
25534,NARRATOR:YOHN ROYCE looks to ROBIN.
25535,ROBIN: Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?
25536,NARRATOR:The surrounding knights begin to approach YOHN ROYCE. YOHN ROYCE walks closer to ROBIN.
25537,"YOHN ROYCE: My lord. My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn. To your father, to your mother, and now to you."
25538,"ROBIN: Do you believe him, Uncle Petyr?"
25539,NARRATOR:YOHN ROYCE turns back to look at LITTLEFINGER.
25540,"LITTLEFINGER: Lord Royce has served the Vale well. He;s enjoyed a distinguished military career. If we could trust his absolute loyalty, he would make a capable commander in the wars to come."
25541,NARRATOR:YOHN ROYCE turns back to ROBIN.
25542,"YOHN ROYCE: You can trust my absolute loyalty, my lord."
25543,LITTLEFINGER: I think he deserves one more chance. What do you say?
25544,ROBIN: Fine.
25545,NARRATOR:YOHN ROYCE bows and walks a few feet away from the engagement.
25546,"LITTLEFINGER (to ROBIN): I bring good news. My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell. I expect she’s headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander. But she won’t be safe there, not with the Boltons after her."
25547,ROBIN: She’s my cousin. We should help her.
25548,LITTLEFINGER: That was my instinct as well.
25549,NARRATOR:LITTLEFINGER turns and walks towards YOHN ROYCE.
25550,LITTLEFINGER: Our lord has spoken. Gather the Knights of the Vale. The time has come to join the fray.
25551,GREY WORM: You invite the enemy into our city?
25552,"TYRION: I did. As a clever man once told me, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”"
25553,NARRATOR:TYRION begins walking away. The others follow.
25554,GREY WORM: I don’t make peace with the queen’s enemies. I kill the queen’s enemies.
25555,"TYRION: Yes, that’s the military approach. And how has that worked here in Meereen? I represent the diplomatic approach."
25556,NARRATOR:TYRION and VARYS begin ascending the stairs to the Great Pyramid.
25557,MISSANDEI: Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her.
25558,NARRATOR:TYRION and VARYS turn back to face MISSANDEI and GREY WORM.
25559,NARRATOR:TYRION We enter these negotiations with open eyes. Trust me. My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution.
25560,MISSANDEI: How many days were you a slave?
25561,NARRATOR:TYRION stammers.
25562,TYRION: Long enough to know.
25563,MISSANDEI: Not long enough to understand.
25564,NARRATOR:TYRION and VARYS proceed up the steps. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.
25565,"NARRATOR:TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM are sitting in attendance to three masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION."
25566,YEZZAN: I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor. And somehow you’ve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen. It’s most impressive.
25567,TYRION: And now you speak for the Good Masters of Astapor.Here’s to reversals of fortune.
25568,RAZDAL: We came here to meet the queen and instead we’re greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch.
25569,"TYRION: Let’s make this simple, shall we? Tell me what you want."
25570,BELICHO: We want you to leave Slaver’s Bay. Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go.
25571,TYRION: Queen Daenerys won’t stay in Meereen forever. Her path takes her westward.
25572,"RAZDAL: When we last met, I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs. She refused them."
25573,"MISSANDEI: She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children still lived in chains."
25574,RAZDAL: As they have since the dawn of time.
25575,GREY WORM: Not anymore.
25576,YEZZAN: You think you’re a free man now? You still follow orders. Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesn’t mean she’s not a master.
25577,"TYRION: Friends, friends, friends, please."
25578,NARRATOR:GREY WORM stares intently at YEZZAN.
25579,TYRION: There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing. That is the way of the world. I’m not here to change the way of the world.
25580,YEZZAN: Slavery is the way of our world.
25581,TYRION: You don’t need slaves to make money. There haven’t been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you. But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it. So here is the queen’s proposal. Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slaver’s Bay time to adjust to the new order.
25582,YEZZAN: What does that mean?
25583,"TYRION: Instead of abolishing slavery overnight, we will give you seven years to end the practice."
25584,NARRATOR:The masters look at each others.
25585,"TYRION: Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses, of course, at fair prices. In exchange, you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy."
25586,YEZZAN: We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.
25587,"TYRION: Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same. I do hope you accept, my friends. You will not receive a better offer."
25588,NARRATOR:TYRION picks up a bell from the table beside him and rings it.
25589,TYRION: Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it. And as a parting gift to our honored guests…
25590,NARRATOR:Three women enter. Each one sits in the lap of one of the masters.
25591,TYRION: Give freedom a chance. See if it doesn’t taste every bit as good as what came before.
25592,"NARRATOR:TYRION exits. VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM follow."
25593,"NARRATOR:A group of commoner representatives are gathered together at the foot of the throne, whispering in Valyrian. TYRION, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM enter on the throne platform."
25594,TYRION (speaking Valyrian): My friends! Large sorry...you wait so fat time.
25595,MISSANDEI (to TYRION): Perhaps I should translate for you.
25596,MAN #1: We speak the Common Tongue.
25597,TYRION: Excellent.
25598,MAN #2: You met with the slavers today.
25599,TYRION: I did.
25600,MAN #1: Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum. Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them.
25601,TYRION: I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled.
25602,NARRATOR:TYRION begins to descend the steps towards the men. MISSANDEI and GREY WORM follow.
25603,TYRION: But I am not your ruler. I’m not the Breaker of Chains. I’m not the Unburnt. And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons.
25604,NARRATOR:TYRION and company reach the bottom of the steps so they are face to face with the men.
25605,MAN #1: You are a stranger here. So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies?
25606,TYRION: Because our queen chose me as her advisor. Until she returns from her travels --
25607,MAN #2: When does she return?
25608,TYRION: Soon. You have my word.
25609,MAN #1: We don’t know you. We don’t trust you. We know Torgo Nudho. We fight with him against the Masters. We trust him.
25610,"TYRION: And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations. As commander of the Unsullied, he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace."
25611,MAN #2: You have made peace with the slavers?
25612,TYRION: We offered terms.
25613,"MAN #1 (speaking Valyrian): And you, Grey Worm? You want to drink wine with these men? The men who tore us from our mothers’ arms and sold us at auction like cattle?"
25614,"MAN #2 (speaking Valyrian): Missandei, you know what these men are. How can you trust them?"
25615,MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): I do not trust them. I will never trust them.
25616,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI pauses and looks at TYRION.
25617,"MISSANDEI (speaking Valyrian): But as a wise man once said, “We make peace with our enemies, not our friends.”"
25618,NARRATOR:TYRION smiles.
25619,"NARRATOR:TYRION, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI are walking together."
25620,GREY WORM: Do not use me for your lies.
25621,TYRION: Those men respect you.
25622,GREY WORM: They respect me because they know who I am. They know I am loyal.
25623,TYRION: As do I.
25624,"GREY WORM: I am loyal to my queen, not you. If you betray her work, you are my enemy."
25625,TYRION: I am not betraying her work. I am trying to save her city.
25626,MISSANDEI: You promised the slavers they could keep slavery.
25627,TYRION: For a short time.
25628,MISSANDEI: Seven years is not a short time for a slave.
25629,TYRION: You’re right. Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once. War is a horror that should be ended at once. I can’t do both today.
25630,GREY WORM: You are wrong to trust these men.
25631,TYRION: I don’t trust the Masters. I trust their self-interest. They’re trustworthy if they’re convinced that working with me is in their self-interest.
25632,GREY WORM: You don’t know them. You don’t understand them. We are not human in their eyes. They look at me and see a weapon. They look at her and see a whore.
25633,TYRION: They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast. Their contempt is their weakness. They’ll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage.
25634,GREY WORM: You will not use them. They will use you. That is what they do.
25635,NARRATOR:JORAH and DAARIO are walking to the top of a mountain crag. JORAH lags behind and stops to catch his breath. DAARIO turns back to him.
25636,DAARIO: You all right? Why don’t you sit and catch your breath?
25637,JORAH: I’m fine.
25638,NARRATOR:DAARIO chuckles.
25639,"DAARIO: I don’t think you could ride the dragon. 20 years ago, maybe."
25640,JORAH: What?
25641,"DAARIO: Our queen. She’s wild, you know. Don’t let her size fool you. It’s hard enough for me and I’m a young man. You, I don’t think your heart could take it."
25642,NARRATOR:JORAH stares at DAARIO for a few moments and then continues along the path.
25643,DAARIO: Must make you angry that our queen chose me.
25644,JORAH: Makes me sad. You’ll disappoint her before long. She’ll move on.
25645,DAARIO: We’ll all disappoint her before long.
25646,NARRATOR:JORAH turns back to face DAARIO.
25647,JORAH: We need each other right now. After we’re done needing each other --
25648,"DAARIO: Oh, I don’t want to fight you, Jorah the Andal. What do I have to gain? If I win, I’m the shit who killed an old man. If I lose, I’m the shit who was killed by an old man."
25649,"JORAH: You didn’t get much discipline as a child, did you?"
25650,DAARIO: None.
25651,NARRATOR:JORAH and DAARIO crawl to the edge of the ridge and look below. Vaes Dothrak sprawls across the valley floor.
25652,"JORAH: The road running through the Horse Gate, they call that the godsway."
25653,"NARRATOR:JORAH points to the eastern division of Vaes Dothrak, and then to the western division."
25654,"JORAH: Eastern Market, Western Market. When Khal Drogo died, she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen, the widows of the dead khals. That’s where they would have taken her, the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen."
25655,NARRATOR:JORAH stands and walks off to the side. He begins undoing his sword belt.
25656,DAARIO: What are you doing?
25657,JORAH: It’s forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city.
25658,DAARIO: Isn’t it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi?
25659,"JORAH: If they spot us and we’re unarmed, we’ll say we’re traders heading for the Western Market. But if they see weapons…"
25660,DAARIO: You’re asking a dog to hand over his teeth.
25661,"JORAH: There’s 100,000 of them down there. We can’t fight our way out. We wait till dark, and then we’ll find her."
25662,"NARRATOR:DAARIO hands over his weapons, except for his dagger. JORAH holds his hand out for the dagger."
25663,DARRIO: Uh…
25664,NARRATOR:DAARIO flips the knife around in his hand.
25665,DAARIO: I’m very attached to this knife.
25666,"NARRATOR:DAARIO kisses and strokes the knife, then motions to hand it to JORAH. He spots the patch of greyscale on JORAH’s arm through a hole in his sleeve. JORAH pinches the fabric of his sleeve together to cover up the greyscale."
25667,JORAH: Don’t worry. it didn’t touch you.
25668,DAARIO: You know what happens?
25669,JORAH: I know what happens.
25670,NARRATOR:DAARIO gestures with the dagger.
25671,DAARIO: I’ll do it myself.
25672,NARRATOR:JORAH walks to the side and stares into space.
25673,NARRATOR:Dothraki men and women are celebrating in the streets. JORAH and DAARIO are sneaking through the stables. They crouch down in front of a railing and see a Dothraki man and woman fornicating.
25674,DAARIO: I should have been born a Dothraki.
25675,"NARRATOR:JORAH and DAARIO sneak into an alleyway. They move through the alley, but spot two Dothraki men coming their way. JORAH grabs DAARIO."
25676,JORAH: Come on.
25677,NARRATOR:JORAN and DAARIO walk out to greet the Dothraki men. They proceed to speak in Dothraki.
25678,JORAH: My friends...We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost. Could you show us the way back?
25679,DOTHRAKI #1: What do you sell?
25680,"JORAH: Wine. Come down to my stall tomorrow, I’ll give you a cask of the Arbor’s finest."
25681,DOTHRAKI #1: You’re not merchants.
25682,NARRATOR:The Dothraki man inclines his head towards his fellow man.
25683,DOTHRAKI #1: Get the others.
25684,"NARRATOR:The second Dothraki man runs down the alleyway. DAARIO darts after him. JORAH swings at the first Dothraki man, but misses. The Dothraki man knees him in the face, knocking him to the ground. DAARIO continues to pursue the other Dothraki man. JORAH strikes his foe twice, but both are blocked. The Dothraki man strikes back with a punch to the face that sends JORAH sprawling. In the alley, just before the other Dothraki man reaches the common area, DAARIO grabs him from behind, places his hand over his mouth, and then snaps his neck. JORAH is rebuffed by his foe a third time. He attempts to throw sand in the Dothraki man’s face, but he dodges out of the way. JORAH climbs to his knees, but the Dothraki man grabs him by the throat and begins choking him. DAARIO stabs the Dothraki man from behind, killing him."
25685,"DAARIO: Told you, I’m very attached to this knife."
25686,NARRATOR:DAARIO tucks the dagger away in his shirt. JORAH climbs to his feet.
25687,DAARIO: You all right?
25688,"JORAH: If they find a body with a stab wound, the whole city will be looking for us."
25689,NARRATOR:DAARIO grabs a large rock and smashes the dead Dothraki man with it several times.
25690,DAARIO: Huh.
25691,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS is sitting among the Dosh Khaleen. The women whisper among themselves, but the leader sits beside DAENERYS. They begin to speak in Dothraki."
25692,LEADER: Some of them don’t think Dothraki should breed with foreigners. They are stupid old women. They don’t realize that we have always diluted our blood. This one is Lhazareen. Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village. How old were you?
25693,LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Twelve.
25694,"LEADER: A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter. How did he show his happiness?"
25695,LHAZAREEN WOMAN: He broke my ribs.
25696,"LEADER: We are not queens here, but the khals depend on us for our wisdom. Our lives have meaning."
25697,DAENERYS: That is more than most have.
25698,"LEADER: When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night, I hope they let you live out your days with us. The other possibilities are not so pleasant."
25699,DAENERYS: I need to make water.
25700,LEADER: You can’t run from Dothraki. You know this.
25701,DAENERYS: I will never run from Dothraki.
25702,"LEADER (to LHAZAREEN WOMAN): Go, show her."
25703,NARRATOR:The Lhazareen woman takes DAENERYS outside the temple. They walk together.
25704,DAENERYS: I needed fresh air. The old women stink.
25705,LHAZAREEN WOMAN: They do stink.
25706,DAENERYS: You must have been very young when your Khal died.
25707,LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Sixteen.
25708,DAENERYS: Too bad he didn’t die sooner.
25709,NARRATOR:DAENERYS and the Lhazareen woman smile at each other.
25710,"LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Yes, too bad."
25711,NARRATOR:The pair round a bend to a secluded desert outcropping.
25712,LHAZAREEN WOMAN: Is it true you have three dragons?
25713,DAENERYS: Mm-hmm.
25714,LHAZAREEN WOMAN: And they breathe fire?
25715,DAENERYS: They do. Would you like to see them one day?
25716,"LHAZAREEN WOMAN: I am Dosh Khaleen. I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die."
25717,"NARRATOR:DAARIO grabs the Lhazareen woman from behind, covers her mouth, and places his dagger against her neck. JORAH is standing behind DAARIO."
25718,"DAENERYS: No, don’t hurt her."
25719,DAARIO: She’ll give us away.
25720,JORAH: We have to go now.
25721,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS grabs DAARIO’s dagger-carrying hand, and he drops it away from the Lhazareen woman’s neck."
25722,DAENERYS: We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive.
25723,JORAH: All we can do is try.
25724,DAENERYS: No. We can do more than that. And you’re going to help me.
25725,NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks at the Lhazareen woman.
25726,"DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): And you...Have faith in me, Khaleesi. Do not betray me."
25727,NARRATOR:The Lhazareen woman nods. DAENERYS looks at DAARIO. DAARIO slowly removes his hand from her mouth.
25728,"NARRATOR:INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELOR CELLMARGAERY is sitting in the corner of her cell. SEPTA UNELLA enters, then guides MARGAERY out into the prayer room where the HIGH SPARROW waits. MARGAERY walks into the room and shields her eyes from the sunlight. SEPTA UNELLA pushes MARGAERY to her knees, then exits."
25729,"HIGH SPARROW: If I were to let you leave right now, where would you go? What would you seek out?"
25730,"MARGAERY: I’d go to my brother, my husband, my family."
25731,"HIGH SPARROW: Of course, but for you, that means seeking out money, finery, power. Seeking out your family means seeking out sin. I’m not maligning you. I sought those things out, too. To the exclusion of all else. My father was a cobbler. He died with I was young and I took over his shop. He was a simple man and he made simple shoes. But I found that the more work I put into my shoes, the more people wanted them. Fine leather, ornamentation, detailing, and time. Time most of all. Dozens of hours spent on a single pair."
25732,MARGAERY: Quality takes time.
25733,"HIGH SPARROW: Yes. I imagine you’ve worn a year of someone’s life on your back. The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege. I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself. Each time I indulged, I felt myself ascending to something better."
25734,"MARGAERY: And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness. Book of the Stranger, verse 25."
25735,HIGH SPARROW: You know The Seven-Pointed Star.
25736,MARGAERY: Septa Unella reads it to me. At me.
25737,"HIGH SPARROW: Yes, yes, she does enjoy reading at people. You’re close. But it wasn’t a graveyard. It was a feast. I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all. We passed around the wine, passed around the women, and soon we fell into a stupor. I woke before dawn. I could barely stand. Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor, lying in heaps next to their fine clothes. The truth of their bodies laid bare. I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn. And I saw it with perfect clarity. I saw what my sins were. The gold I had, the wine I drank, the women I used, my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position. It was all part of a story. A story I was telling myself about who I was. A collection of lies that would disappear in the light. The people I was trying to climb away from, the beggars in the street, the poor, they were closer to the truth than I ever was."
25738,MARGAERY: So what did you do?
25739,HIGH SPARROW: I left to go and find them. I didn’t even put on my shoes. I walked out the door and never went back.
25740,NARRATOR:The HIGH SPARROW stands and extends his hand out to MARGAERY.

25748,MARGAERY: Listen to me. You need to stay strong.
25749,LORAS: I can’t stay strong. I never was strong.
25750,"MARGAERY: You are strong. You are the future of our house, the future of our family."
25751,LORAS: I don’t care about that.
25752,LORAS: I just want it to stop. Help me.
25753,"MARGAERY: They want me to help you. They want me told help tear you down. That’s why he’s letting me see you, I know it is. And if either of us give in to what they want, then they win."
25754,LORAS: Let them win. Just make it stop. Please.
25755,NARRATOR:LORAS begins sobbing. MARGAERY embraces him.
25756,MARGAERY: All right.
25757,CUT TO: RED KEEP – TOMMEN'S CHAMBER
25758,NARRATOR:CERSEI is walking down the hall to TOMMEN’s chamber. She hears MAESTER PYCELLE talking.
25759,"MAESTER PYCELLE: And now, how to avert disaster with our current predicament. This High Sparrow. I have dealt with fanatics of every description, Your Grace. Not setting them off, that’s the most important thing. You are beset with enemies both within and without."
25760,NARRATOR:CERSEI enters the room
25761,CERSEI: What are you doing here?
25762,MAESTER PYCELLE: I am advising the king on our current predicament.
25763,CERSEi: Leave.
25764,MAESTER PYCELL: I am a member of the Small Council. The king’s small --
25765,CERSEI: Is this a Small Council meeting?
25766,MAESTER PYCELL: Obviously not. I’m here to lend my wisdom and my support.
25767,"TOMMEN: Thank you for your counsel, Grand Maester. That will be all for now."
25768,MAESTER PYCELL: Your Grace.
25769,"NARRATOR:MAESTER PYCELLE hobbles towards the door. As he leaves, he flashes CERSEI a smile. CERSEI closes the door."
25770,"CERSEI: Since I’ve missed the past several Small Coucil meetings, I wanted to speak to you about a few things."
25771,TOMMEN: I’ve been thinking about the High Sparrow.
25772,"CERSEI: As have we all, unfortunately."
25773,TOMMEN: We need to be careful in dealing with such a man. To prevent things from escalating any further. We have to be careful not to antagonize him. He has Margaery. We can’t put her at risk. He’s dangerous.
25774,NARRATOR:CERSEI takes TOMMEN by the chin.
25775,CERSEI: Look at me. What did they do to me? To the king’s own mother?
25776,NARRATOR:TOMMEN looks down.
25777,CERSEI: It’s all right. It's done. It’s in the past. And of course Margaery’s safety is paramount.
25778,"TOMMEN: You don’t like Margaery, do you?"
25779,"CERSEI: Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant. Margaery is the queen. Queens must command respect. Kings even more so. Not just for their own sake, but for everyone’s. The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens. No respect for anything in this world. He has no use for the things of this world. He want to knock them down and replace them with what? With fantasies. With beggars in the street. With nothing."
25780,TOMMEN: Mother...there’s something I want to tell you. Something the High Sparrow told me.
25781,CERSEI: You’ve spoken with him?
25782,TOMMEN: I promised him I wouldn’t tell anyone. If he found out I told --
25783,"CERSEI: It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly, given his constant prattling about the truth. I am your mother. You can always trust me."
25784,CUT TO: RED KEEP – SMALL COUNCIL CHAMBER
25785,NARRATOR:KEVAN and LADY OLENNA are waiting in the Small Council chamber for the meeting to start. CERSEI and JAIME enter.
25786,CERSEI: The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the king’s orders.
25787,NARRATOR:KEVIN and LADY OLENNA stand up.
25788,LADY OLENNA: I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time. You’re not welcome.
25789,CERSEI: You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with one’s rivals.
25790,"LADY OLENNA: My dear, you have been stripped of your dignity and authority, publicly shamed, and confined to the Red Keep. What’s left to work with?"
25791,JAIME: Cersei is the mother of the king. She has the king’s ear and his trust. And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.
25792,"CERSEI: The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back. Here we are. Well done to us. Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty, peasant hands. In a few days, he’ll have a trial for me. But before that, Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement. Yes, Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city."
25793,"LADY OLENNA: Oh, no. That cannot happen. That will not happen."
25794,CERSEi: I agree.
25795,"JAIME (to KEVAN): You’ve got the second largest army in Westeros. You'll bring them into the city, stop queen Margaery’s humiliation before it starts, and take her back into Crown custody."
25796,KEVAN:  The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queen’s safety.
25797,"JAIME:  You’ll take no action at all. When the Tyrell armies come, you will stand down. Are you expressly forbidden from standing down?"
25798,"KEVAN: No, but if the king should call on me --"
25799,"JAIME:  The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything. When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead, preferably, and Margaery's back at Tommen’s side, do you think the king will be angry at the outcome?"
25800,CERSEI: You hate these fanatics as much as we do. You hate what they’ve done to your son.  Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good?
25801,KEVAN: Of course I want him back.
25802,CERSEI: Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed.
25803,"KEVAN: If it doesn’t go as planned, the Sparrows have many friends in the city. We’ll have civil war. Many will die."
25804,LADY OLENNA: Many will die no matter what we do. Better them than us.

25816,THEON: I know. I know and I’m sorry.
25817,YARA: Stop saying that.
25818,THEON: He broke me. He broke me into a thousand pieces.
25819,YARA: I know.
25820,THEON: You don’t know.
25821,YARA: He send us one of those pieces. That’s why I came for you.
25822,NARRATOR:THEON sobs.
25823,YARA: Why did you come here?
25824,THEON: Where else could I go?
25825,YARA: You heard father was dead and thought you’d claim the crown?
25826,"THEON: No, no. I only heard he died after we docked."
25827,YARA: You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot?
25828,THEON: I didn’t know.
25829,YARA: You think any Ironborn wants you to be king? After what you’ve done?
25830,THEON: I don’t want to be king.
25831,YARA: What do you want?
25832,THEON: I should’ve listened to you. You’re the only one --
25833,YARA: That doesn’t matter anymore. Stop crying.  Look at me. Tell me what you want.
25834,THEON: You should rule the Iron Islands. Let me help you.

25981,"JAQEN: He was no one. The Many-Faced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift. The man taught others in exchange for their service. Many served, many more gifts were given. Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled."
25982,ARYA: Where did they go?
25983,"JAQEN: Here. They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house. These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others. The first Faceless Men. And now a girl is one of them, if a girl desires."

25998,"LADYC RANE: I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land. And our son alone on that cold, cold throne without a guiding hand. Who will teach him strength? Who will teach him grace? To whom will he turn when it’s time to learn to look darkness in the face?"
25999,IZEMBARO: Ned stark will do fine. Now bring me more wine.
26000,"NARRATOR:BOBONO, portraying TYRION, appears and fills his glass. CAMELLO, portraying NED, appears and adjusts his crotch."
26001,"CAMELLO: Ooh! Ooh, what’s happened here, then?"

26004,NARRATOR:CAMELLO gestures to IZEMBARO.
26005,"CAMELLO: I’d ask him for permission, but he smells too bloody awful."

26020,CAMELLO: What’s that mean?
26021,LADY CRANE: The lawful ascension.

26026,CAMELLO: But we had a deal all done and dusted.
26027,NARRATOR:Two prop men carrying spears lift CAMELLO to his feet.
26028,CAMELLO: I’m starting to think you can’t be trusted.

26030,BIANCA: Save my father.
26031,LADY CRANE: Truly you should. Killing the man will do you no good.

26047,NARRATOR:CAMELLO approaches ARYA and tosses her his costume cloak.
26048,"CAMELLO: Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me."
26049,"IZEMBARO (to BIANCA): You can do better, Bianca, dear. You must do."
26050,BIANCA: I had two lines.
26051,IZEMBARO: There are no small parts. You rang very false.

26069,ARYA: If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall…
26070,JAQEN: A girl is not ready.
26071,ARYA: She’s a good actress.
26072,JAQEN: So a man has heard.
26073,ARYA: Seems like a decent woman.
26074,JAQEN: Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind?
26075,ARYA: No. Who wants her dead?
26076,JAQEN: That does not matter. The price was paid.
26077,ARYA: The younger actress. She’s jealous because Lady Crane is better.
26078,JAQEN: A girl must decide if she wants to serve the Many-Faced God.

26085,BRAN: It was you. You made the White Walkers.
26086,LEAF: We were at war. We were being slaughtered. Our sacred trees cut down. We needed to defend ourselves.
26087,BRAN: From whom?
26088,LEAF: From you. From men.
26089,NARRATOR:LEAF exits. BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN stare at each other.
26090,AERON: We speak in the presence of the Drowned God. In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader. Who makes a claim?
26091,NARRATOR:YARA walks out into the open.
26092,"YARA: I am Yara Greyjoy, daughter of Balon Greyjoy, King of the Iron Islands. I claim the Salt Throne."
26093,MAN #1: We’ve never had a queen. Not once.
26094,"YARA: There are many things we’ve never done. We’ve never made our mark upon the world. The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance. Then they swat us down. They conquer us, humiliate us, and go right back to forgetting we exist."
26095,ALL: Aye!
26096,YARA: We are a sea people.
26097,ALL: Aye!
26098,YARA: Our god is a sea god.

26101,MAN #2: You shall not be queen!

26104,NARRATOR:The man looks at THEON. THEON emerges from the crowd and turns to face them.
26105,THEON: I am Theon Greyjoy...last living son of Balon Greyjoy.
26106,NARRATOR:THEON points at YARA.
26107,"THEON: And she is your rightful ruler. Those of you that have sailed under her, and there are many of you here, you know what she is."
26108,ALL: Aye!
26109,THEON: She is a reaver!
26110,ALL: Aye!
26111,THEON: She is a warrior!
26112,ALL: Aye!
26113,THEON: She is ironborn!
26114,ALL: Aye!

26116,NARRATOR:THEON and YARA stare at each other. The men cheer and chant YARA’s name.
26117,EURON: I’m Euron Greyjoy.
26118,NARRATOR:The men fall silent. EURON appears and walks through the crowd towards YARA and THEON.
26119,EURON: I claim the Salt Throne.
26120,NARRATOR:EURON emerges from the crowd and stands before YARA and THEON. He looks at YARA.
26121,EURON: Niece.
26122,NARRATOR:EURON looks at THEON and then walks up to him.
26123,EURON: Nephew. Little Theon.
26124,"NARRATOR:EURON pats THEON on the cheek, then turns to face the crowd."
26125,EURON: Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground. Captured a castle you couldn’t keep. Got yourself taken prisoner. Even heard you have no cock.
26126,NARRATOR:The Ironborn laugh. EURON points at YARA.
26127,EURON: Explains why you think a woman can be king.
26128,"YARA: When did you return, Uncle?"
26129,EURON: A few days ago. I had some things to take care of. Long overdue.
26130,YARA: I’m glad you’re here. Now I know what my first act as queen will be. To execute the man who killed my father.
26131,NARRATOR:The men murmur to each other.
26132,EURON: I did. I killed him. Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall. He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it weren’t for me. No one loved him. No one wanted to follow him. He led ius into two wars we couldn’t win. I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago.
26133,"THEON: That would have been hard to do. You weren’t here. Last I heard, you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time."
26134,EURON: Gallivanting? That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off?
26135,NARRATOR:The Ironborn laugh.
26136,EURON: Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that?
26137,THEON: You were gone. Yara was here. Being Ironborn. Leading Ironborn. Getting ready to bring us back to glory.
26138,EURON: And how will she do that?
26139,YARA: I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen.
26140,"EURON: Right idea, except I’m the one who’s going to build the Iron Fleet because I’m the one who knows how to use it. I’ve been all over the world. I’ve seen more of it than all of you combined. And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do. Someone with a large army, three large dragons, and no husband. I’m going to build that fleet and I’m going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock."
26141,NARRATOR:The Ironborn laugh.
26142,YARA: You’re going to seduce the Dragon Queen?
26143,EURON: I’m not going to seduce her. The Iron Fleet will seduce her. And together we’re going to take the Seven Kingdoms. I wasn’t born to be king. I paid the iron price and here I stand.
26144,NARRATOR:The Ironborn cheer and chant EURON’s name. THEON and YARA exchange a glance.
26145,"NARRATOR:Several Ironborn carrying flags stand on the shore. EURON is kneeling in the water. AERON pushes him underwater. Meanwhile, YARA, THEON, and some Ironborn run through a cave tunnel."
26146,"AERON: May Euron, your servant, be born again from the sea as you were. Bless him with salt. Bless him with stone. Bless him with steel."
26147,"NARRATOR:THEON, YARA, and the men with them run out onto a beach and into awaiting rowboats."
26148,AERSON: Listen to the waves. Listen to the god. He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy. Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away. Let the old Euron drown. Let his lungs fill with seawater.
26149,NARRATOR:EURON drowns.
26150,AERON: Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes.
26151,"NARRATOR:YARA, THEON, and the men board a large ship."
26152,"AERON: What is dead may never die, but rises again harder and stronger."
26153,"NARRATOR:AERON releases his grip on EURON. Two Ironborn carrying EURON onto shore. AERON and the other Ironborn gathered in attendance all stare at EURON. EURON does not move.One man begins to walk closer to him. EURON gags and coughs. He props himself up on his arms and legs, then spits up water and gasps for air. AERON retrieves a crown made of driftwood and places it on EURON’s head."
26154,AERON: What is dead may never die.
26155,ALL: What is dead may never die.
26156,NARRATOR:The Ironborn cheer. EURON rises to his feet and looks around at the crowd.
26157,EURON: Where are my niece and nephew? Let’s go murder them.
26158,NARRATOR:EURON leads AERON and the Ironborn up to a seaside cliff. They stare out at the ocean. A fleet of ships is sailing away from Pyke.
26159,AERON: They stole our best ships.
26160,EURON: Won’t be enough to save them.
26161,NARRATOR:EURON turns to face the Ironborn.
26162,EURON: Go back to your homes. Chop down every tree you can find. Quarter-saw the timber and start building. I want every man bending planks. I want every woman spinning flax for sails. Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world.
26163,DAENERYS (to JORAH): I banished you twice. You came back twice. And you saved my life. So I can’t take you back and I can’t send you away.
26164,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS approaches JORAH, but he recoils."
26165,JORAH: You must send me away.
26166,NARRATOR:JORAH rolls up his sleeve to reveal the greyscale covering his forearm.
26167,DAENERYS: Is there a cure?
26168,JORAH: I don’t know.
26169,DAENERYS: How long does it take?
26170,JORAH: I don’t know that either. But I’ve seen what happens when it goes far enough. I’ll end things before that.
26171,NARRATOR:DAENERYS begins to cry.
26172,DAENERYS: I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.
26173,"JORAH: Don’t be. All I’ve ever wanted was to serve you. Tyrion Lannister was right. I love you. I’ll always love you. Goodbye, Khaleesi."
26174,NARRATOR:JORAH begins to walk away.
26175,"DAENERYS: Do not walk away from your queen, Jorah the Andal."
26176,NARRATOR:JORAH turns back to face DAENERYS. She approaches him.
26177,DAENERYS: You have not been dismissed. You pledged yourself to me. You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life.
26178,NARRATOR:JORAH nods.
26179,"DAENERYS: Well, I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world. I command you to heal yourself and then return to me. When I take the Seven Kingdoms, I need you by my side."
26180,"NARRATOR:JORAH sits on a horse, watching DAENERYS and DAARIO lead the Dothraki horde out of Vaes Dothrak. He turns his horse around and starts off into the wilderness."
26181,"VARYS: In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters, how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy?"
26182,GREY WORM: None.
26183,VARYS: And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men.
26184,"GREY WORM: Two, but that was the day of the pact. Since then, nothing."
26185,VARYS: So it’s safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold.
26186,GREY WORM: For now.
26187,VARYS: For now is the best we get in our profession.
26188,TYRION: It’s not enough.
26189,"VARYS: Considering the city was on the brink of civil war, I’d say it’s a good start."
26190,"TYRION: It’s not enough for Meereen to have peace. They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it. The Sons of the Harpy have a good story. Resist the foreign invaders. Our queen has an even better story. Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains and...all that."
26191,MISSANDEI: The people know who brought them freedom.
26192,"TYRION: Yes, but do they know who brought them security? Who brought about an end to the violence? We need someone the people trust, someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced."
26193,VARYS: Sounds like quite the hero. Where would we find him?
26194,TYRION: Who said anything about “him”?
26195,"NARRATOR:TYRION and VARYS stand on the plateau above the audience chamber. A woman stans  at the bottom of the steps, and a man stand a few steps in front of her."
26196,"MAN (speaking Valyrian): You stand in the presence of Kinvara, High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis, the Flame of Truth, the Light of Wisdom, the First Servant of the Lord of Light."
26197,NARRATOR:The man steps aside. KINVARA walks up a few steps.
26198,TYRION (speaking Valyrian): Welcome to Meereen.
26199,NARRATOR:KINVARA stops on the middle plateau.
26200,TYRION: That’s about the extent of my Valyrian.
26201,NARRATOR:KINVARA says nothing.
26202,TYRION: Thank you for travelling all this way. I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be.
26203,NARRATOR:TYRION looks at VARYS. KINVARA says nothing.
26204,TYRION: The truth is we need your help. We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to --
26205,KINVARA: You don’t need to persuade me. I came to help.
26206,NARRATOR:KINVARA continues up the steps.
26207,KINVARA: Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised. From the fire she was reborn to remake the world.
26208,TYRION: Yes.
26209,KINVARA: She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.
26210,TYRION: She did indeed.
26211,"KINVARA: Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light. But you heard all this before, haven’t you? On the Long Bridge of Volantis. The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands, burning their sins and flesh away."
26212,TYRION: Ideally we’d avoid purifying too many nonbelievers. The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths.
26213,"KINVARA: You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed. And while she’s gone, you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed."
26214,TYRION: I’d settle for obeyed.
26215,KINVARA: I will summon my most eloquent priests. They will spread the word. Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come.
26216,TYRION: That sounds most excellent --
26217,"VARYS: A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses. He, too, had a glorious destiny. He attacked King’s Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me. Last I had heard, he’d been defeated again, this time at Winterfell and this time for good."
26218,TYRION: We’d be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen.
26219,VARYS: I suppose it’s hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake. Isn’t that the whole point of being a fanatic? You’re always right. Everything is the Lord’s will.
26220,KINVARA: Everything is the Lord’s will. But men and women make mistakes. Even honest servants of the Lord.
26221,"VARYS: And you, an honest servant of the lord, why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis?"
26222,"TYRION: My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion, but we are all loyal supporters of the queen."
26223,NARRATOR:VARYS nods. KINVARA takes two more steps. She is one step away from TYRION and VARYS.
26224,"KINVARA: Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason. Terrible things happen for a reason. Take what happened to you, Lord Varys, when you were a child. If not for your mutilation at the hand of a second-rate sorcerer, you wouldn’t be here helping the Lord’s Chosen bring his light into the world. Knowledge has made you powerful. But there’s still so much you don’t know. Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire? You heard a voice call out from the flames. Do you remember? Should I tell you what the voice said?"
26225,NARRATOR:KINVARA approaches VARYS and places her hand on his arm.
26226,KINVARA: Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke?
26227,NARRATOR:VARYS scrunches up his face and stares at KINVARA. KINVARA smiles.
26228,"KINVARA: We serve the same queen. If you are her true friend, you have nothing to fear from me."
26229,NARRATOR:KINVARA turns and walks back down the steps.
26230,"NARRATOR:BRAN walks among the spiraling stones surrounding the weirwood tree from before, only now everything is covered in snow. He stares at the tree, then turns around. The army of the undead stands in attendance."
26231,BRAN: What?
26232,"NARRATOR:BRAN walks towards them, and then among their ranks. They do not react. He inspects several of them as he walks by. On the other side of the army, he finds the Night King and four White Walkers on horseback. The Night King stares at him. BRAN turns around to find the entire army of the undead staring at him. When he turns back around, the Night King is standing right behind him. He recoils, but the Night King grabs his forearm. He screams."
26233,NARRATOR:BRAN screams as he releases the tree root and the vision ends. MEERA jumps to her feet.
26234,"BRAN: He saw me, the Night King! He saw me!"
26235,THREE-EYED RAVEN: He touched you.
26236,NARRATOR:LEAF and another Child of the Forest enter.
26237,"BRAN: I don’t know. He was close, but --"
26238,THREE-EYED RAVEN: He touched you.
26239,NARRATOR:BRAN pulls back his sleeve. There is a handprint on his forearm.
26240,THREE-EYED RAVEN: He knows you are here. He’ll come for you.
26241,BRAN: But he can’t get in.
26242,"THREE-EYED RAVEN: He can now. His mark is on you. You must leave, all of you."
26243,"MEERA: Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge."
26244,HODOR: Hodor.
26245,BRAN: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to.
26246,THREE-EYED RAVEN: The time has come.
26247,BRAN: The time for what?
26248,THREE-EYED RAVEN: For you to become me.
26249,BRAN: But am I ready?
26250,THREE-EYED RAVEN: No.
26251,NARRATOR:BRAN’s eyes turn white.
26252,"JON SNOW: We can’t defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons. If we want to survive, we need Winterfell, and to take Winterfell, we need more men."
26253,"DAVOS: Aside from the Starks and the Boltons, the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers, the Karstarks, and the Manderlys."
26254,NARRATOR:DAVOS stands and moves some of the tokens to Winterfell.
26255,"DAVOS: The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons, so we’re not doing so well there."
26256,SANSA: The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies. They can hang. But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice.
26257,"DAVOS: I beg your pardon, my lady, but they know that a Stark beheaded their father. I don’t think we can count on them either."
26258,"SANSA: How well do you know the North, Ser Davos?"
26259,"DAVOS: Precious little, my lady."
26260,"SANSA: My father always said Northerners are different. More loyal, more suspicious of outsiders."
26261,"DAVOS: They may well be loyal, but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family? I may not know the North, but I know men. They’re more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them don’t want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause. If Jon’s going to convince them to fight alongside him, they need to believe it’s a fight they can win."
26262,"SANSA: The North remembers. They remember the Stark name. People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay’s own door."
26263,DAVOS: I don’t doubt it. But Jon doesn’t have the Stark name.
26264,"SANSA: No, but I do."
26265,NARRATOR:JON SNOW stares at SANSA.
26266,"SANSA: Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark’s son as Ramsay is Roose Bolton’s. Ant there are also the Tullys. They’re not Northern, but they will back us against the Boltons without question."
26267,DAVOS: I didn’t know the Tullys still had an army.
26268,SANSA: My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun.
26269,JON SNOW: How do you know that?
26270,SANSA: Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell.
26271,"DAVOS: That’s good. The Blackfish is a legend. His support would mean a great deal. Stark, Tully, a few more houses, almost starts to look like a winning side."
26272,NARRATOR:SANSA smiles.
26273,NARRATOR:BRIENNE follows SANSA down the stairs and along a walkway.
26274,"BRIENNE: I’ve sworn to protect you, my lady."
26275,SANSA: You heard them. We need more men and my uncle has an army.
26276,BRIENNE: We can send the Blackfish a raven.
26277,SANSA: Can’t risk Ramsay intercepting it. It has to be you.
26278,NARRATOR:BRIENNE and SANSA enter SANSA’s chamber. BRIENNE closes the door behind them.
26279,SANSA: Ride for Riverrun. My uncle will talk to you and you’ll know how to talk to him.
26280,NARRATOR:SANSA sits down on her bed.
26281,SANSA: What is it?
26282,BRIENNE: I don’t like leaving you here alone.
26283,SANSA: With Jon?
26284,"BRIENNE: Not him. He seems trustworthy. A bit brooding, perhaps. I suppose that’s understandable, considering. The others, though. Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic. And when Stannis paid for his crime, where were they? Already out looking for a leader with better prospects. And that wildling fellow with the beard --"
26285,"SANSA: Jon isn’t Tormund. Jon isn’t Davos, the Red Woman, or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon. He’s my brother. He’ll keep me safe. I trust him."
26286,BRIENNE: Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun?
26287,"NARRATOR:Several men of the Night’s Watch are readying horses. JON SNOW stands beside them. MELISANDRE sits on her horse behind them. BRIENNE walks past. SANSA approaches JON SNOW, carrying a bundled cloak."
26288,JON SNOW: New dress?
26289,SANSA: I made it myself. Do you like it?
26290,"SANSA: Good, because I made this for you."
26291,NARRATOR:SANSA hands JON SNOW the cloak. JON SNOW looks at it. The direwolf sigil of House Stark is pressed into the leather straps.
26292,SANSA: I made it like the one Father used to wear. As near as I can remember.
26293,"JON SNOW: Thank you, Sansa."
26294,SANSA: You’re welcome.
26295,"NARRATOR:SANSA walks away. BRIENNE is sitting on horseback beside TORMUND. TORMUND stares at her. She catches him staring and looks away. He grins. DOLOROUS EDD approaches JON SNOW, who is donning his new cloak."
26296,JON SNOW: Don’t knock it down while I’m gone.
26297,DOLOROUS EDD: I’ll do my best.
26298,NARRATOR:They embrace.
26299,DOLOROUS EDD: Good luck.
26300,"NARRATOR:JON SNOW walks to his horse and climbs atop it. He leads SANSA, MELISANDRE, PODRICK, BRIENNE, TORMUND, and the rest of the party out through the southern gates. A man of the Night’s Watch approaches DOLOROUS EDD, who is watching them leave."
26301,"MAN: Should we close the gate, Lord Commander?"
26302,DOLOROUS EDD: I’m not the Lord Comman --
26303,NARRATOR:The men of the Night’s Watch gather around DOLOROUS EDD.
26304,"DOLOROUS EDD: Yeah, ahem, close the bloody gate."
26305,"MEERA: We can go home now, Hodor. Well, maybe not home home, but somewhere that isn’t a cave."
26306,NARRATOR:HODOR chuckles.
26307,HODOR: Hodor.
26308,MEERA: Eat something that isn’t moss. I want an egg. How do you like ‘em? Boiled? Fried up with some butter?
26309,NARRATOR:HODOR laughs.
26310,HODOR: Hodor.
26311,MEERA: With a rasher of bacon and some blood sausage.
26312,HODOR: Hodor.
26313,"NARRATOR:MEERA notices she can see her breath. She looks at BRAN and then runs to the entrance of the cave. LEAF and the other Children of the Forest are gathered outside. Across the field, the Night King, three White Walkers, and the army of the dead are gathered. The Night King steps forward, kneels, and places his hand on the ground. A rift cracks through the ice all across the field and into the Great Weirwood Tree."
26314,LEAF: Get Bran and run!
26315,"NARRATOR:MEERA runs back into the cave, retrieving a sword on the way back. The Night King unsheathes his blade and leads the White Walkers and the army of the dead towards the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA runs to BRAN and shakes him."
26316,"MEERA: Bran. Bran, wake up. Bran."
26317,"NARRATOR:HODOR sits in the corner, rocking back and forth."
26318,HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
26319,"MEERA: Bran, wake up."
26320,NARRATOR:BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN watch YOUNG NED and YOUNG BENJEN embrace. BRAN smiles.
26321,NARRATOR:MEERA hauls the sledge over to BRAN and tries to drag him onto it.
26322,MEERA: Hodor.
26323,HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
26324,MEERA: Help me!
26325,"NARRATOR:Outside, LEAF and the Children of the Forest throw magic spheres at the army of the undead. The spheres explode upon contact, killing some of the wights. With one of the last bombs, LEAF lights a half-circle of flame in front of the entrance to the cave. She and the Children of the Forest run inside. The Night King and the White Walkers approach the flame. The flame parts to let them pass, then reforms. The army of the dead cannot pass through the flame. They go around it and climb the crag to the top of the Great Weirwood. Inside, MEERA places BRAN on the sledge."
26326,NARRATOR:BRAN and the THREE-EYED RAVEN continue to watch.
26327,RICKARD (to YOUNG NED): Remember that you are a Stark. Comport yourself with dignity at the Vale and try to stay out of fights.
26328,NARRATOR:NAN walks over to YOUNG HODOR and takes his arm.
26329,"YOUNG NED: Yes, Father."
26330,NARRATOR:RICKARD takes YOUNG NED by the chin.
26331,"RICKARD: But if you have to fight, win."
26332,NARRATOR:MEERA continues shaking BRAN.
26333,"MEERA: Bran! Bran, wake up!"

26336,HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
26337,"NARRATOR:LEAF enters and runs up to BRAN and MEERA. A third wight falls from the ceiling, suspended upside down by its feet. LEAF rushes over to it and beheads it with her knife."

26343,"MEERA: Bran, we’re all going to die!"
26344,NARRATOR:BRAN hears MEERA shouting at him from the other side.
26345,"MEERA (V.O.): Bran, wake up! We’re all going to die! Bran! Bran!"
26346,"MEERA: Bran, you have to wake up! We need Hodor!"
26347,HODOR: Hodor. Hodor.
26348,MEERA: Warg into Hodor now!
26349,NARRATOR:BRAN looks at YOUNG HODOR and NAN.
26350,"MEERA (V.O.): Bran, wake up. We need Hodor. We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now! Now!"
26351,"THREE-EYED RAVEN: Listen to your friend, Brandon."
26352,HODOR (V.O.): Hodor. Hodor. Hodor. Hodor.
26353,"NARRATOR:HODOR’s eyes flash white. More wights enter the cave. One of them kills another Child of the Forest. MEERA cuts it down. Another Child of the Forest  jumps forward and stabs another wight with a spear. HODOR stands and walks over to BRAN.  A White Walker enters. The spear-bearing Child of the Forest lunges at it and stabs it in the chest, but the blow has no effect. The White Walker pushes the spear aside and stabs the Child of the Forest, killing her. HODOR lifts the sledge with BRAN atop it. MEERA grabs a dragonglass spear and launches it into the White Walker’s neck. The White Walker shatters and dies. MEERA and LEAF follow HODOR towards the back entrance. SUMMER growls and bares his teeth at the wights entering the cave."

BRAN is still engaged in a vision on the sledge. A slew of wights pursues them. Back in the cave, the Night King enters and approaches the THREE-EYED RAVEN."
26357,THREE-EYED RAVEN: The time has come. Leave me.
26358,"NARRATOR:Back in the Great Weirwood tree, the Night King slashes the THREE-EYED RAVEN. The THREE-EYED RAVEN dissolves into a black mist in front of BRAN."
26359,NARRATOR:The undead army is advancing. LEAF stops running.
26360,MEERA: What are you doing?
26361,LEAF: Go!
26362,"NARRATOR:LEAF turns to face the undead. She brandishes a magic bomb and primes it. The wights overtake her and knock her to the ground, stabbing her repeatedly. LEAF detonates the bomb, killing herself and the wights surrounding her. HODOR reaches the rear door. He puts down the sledge and begins ramming the door. More wights appear and begin advancing."
26363,"MEERA: Hodor, hurry!"
26364,"NARRATOR:HODOR heaves the door open and drags the sledge outside. He drops the sledge and returns to the door, holding it closed. MEERA lifts the sledge and begins dragging it away."
26365,MEERA: Hold the door!
26366,"NARRATOR:BRAN turns and stares at YOUNG HODOR, who stares back at him."
26367,MEERA (V.O.): Hold the door! Hold the door! Hold the door!
26368,NARRATOR:YOUNG HODOR’s eyes turn white. He falls to the ground and convulses.
26369,NARRATOR:HODOR puts his weight against the door.

26381,"NARRATOR:TITLE SEQUENCEEXT. BEYOND THE WALLHeavy snow is falling. MEERA is dragging BRAN’s sledge through the forest. BRAN’s eyes are glazed white. He experiences many visions of the past all at once. MEERA staggers and falls against the base of a tree. She puts all her weight into pulling the sledge, but it does not budge. She begins crying and goes to BRAN, cradling his head. BRAN continues to have rapid fire visions, then sees a group of wights running through the woods. He wakes up from the visions and looks at MEERA."
26382,BRAN: Meera. They found us.
26383,NARRATOR:MEERA looks out into the woods and sees the group of wights. She begins crying and embraces BRAN.
26384,MEERA: I’m so sorry.
26385,"NARRATOR:The wights converge on MEERA and BRAN. Moments before they reach them, a cloaked rider appears. The rider’s horse kicks one of the wights out of the way, then the rider extends a chain which lights on fire at the end. Two wights charge, and the rider hits them both with the chain, setting them on fire. A third wight tries to attack his horse, but the horse’s bulk rebuffs it into a tree and it crumbles. The rider plunges a chain-sickle into the chest of another wight, then rides forward, dragging the wight behind his horse. He sets another wight on fire with the chain, launching it into the air, and then approaches BRAN and MEERA."
26386,"RIDER: Come with me, now."
26387,NARRATOR:A large group of wights approaches.
26388,RIDER: The dead don’t rest.
26389,NARRATOR:The rider leans down and hoists BRAN up onto his horse. MEERA takes the rider’s hand and joins them on the horse’s back. The three of them ride off into the forest with wights in pursuit.
26390,"NARRATOR:EXT. ROAD TO HORN HILLSAM, GILLY, and LITTLE SAMare riding in a carriage escorted by several soldiers. GILLY looks out the window. SAM is holding LITTLE SAM."
26391,GILLY: It’s so green.
26392,"SAM: Oh, yes. Once you get south of the Riverlands, very different sorts of trees start to take over. Maple, elm, beech, poplar. The odd willow. And of course now that summer’s over, you’ll start seeing the autumn colors coming in. Still, you’ll find more green here than anywhere else."
26393,GILLY: You’re nervous. You’re a nervous talker.
26394,NARRATOR:SAM looks away.
26395,GILLY: That’s not any better being a nervous mute.
26396,"SAM: I didn’t think I’d ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and, well, threaten to kill me if I didn’t. A person just doesn’t feel welcome at that point."
26397,NARRATOR:GILLY looks at LITTLE SAM.
26398,SAM: And I certainly didn’t expect to be introducing him to my family. So you know what to tell them.
26399,GILLY: That Little Sam is your baby.
26400,"SAM: Yes, now that’s very important. If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild, he’ll take you in. He’ll get an education. He’ll learn to read. And you can help teach him. Huh?"
26401,GILLY: What did you tell your family about me?
26402,SAM: I told them I met you in the North.
26403,GILLY: Did you tell them how far north?
26404,"SAM: Well, it wasn’t a very large piece of parchment."
26405,GILLY: You didn’t tell them where I’m really from? You didn’t tell them I’m a wildling?
26406,"SAM: The thing is...my father doesn’t like wildlings. He hoped I’d make a man of myself by “killing some bloody wildlings,” so it’s probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible."
26407,NARRATOR:GILLY looks out the window.
26408,GILLY: I think we’re here.
26409,NARRATOR:SAM looks out the window. The carriage is approaching the castle on Horn Hill.

26430,"MELESSA (to LITTLE SAM): You have a curious mind, I can tell. You’ll be a scholar like your father."
26431,SAM: Where is Father? And Dickon?
26432,MELESSA: They’re on a hunt. They’ll join us for dinner. Come inside. Such a journey. You must be exhausted.
26433,NARRATOR:MELESSA passes LITTLE SAM back to GILLY. SAM and MELESSA proceed up the steps. TALLA takes GILLY’s arm and they follow.
26434,"TALLA: Come, you’ll be wanting a bath after all that travel. Oh, and a dress for dinner. You can wear one of mine. What’s your color? Midnight blue or silver? Silver, maybe. Come. You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want."
26435,NARRATOR:INT. GREAT SEPT OF BAELORTOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are standing in the central chamber. TOMMEN lights a candle.
26436,TOMMEN: Is there no other way?
26437,HIGH SPARROW: You’re afraid for her?
26438,TOMMEN: Of course I’m afraid for her! It just seems very dangerous.
26439,HIGH SPARROW: She’ll be protected the entire way. The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds. And Queen Margaery isn’t your mother. I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf. She’s truly opened her heart to them.
26440,TOMMEN: She’s always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate.
26441,HIGH SPARROW: And now she’s devoted to the gods as well. Would you like to see her?
26442,NARRATOR:MARGAERY is sitting on a bench reading a book. The door opens. TOMMEN and the HIGH SPARROW are visible outside. TOMMEN enters and stares at MARGAERY. The HIGH SPARROW closes the door behind TOMMEN. MARGAERY sets down her book and stands. They embrace.
26443,TOMMEN: Have they hurt you? Have they mistreated you?
26444,"MARGAERY: No, Your Grace."
26445,TOMMEN: I’ve missed you. More than you could know.
26446,MARGAERY: We’ll be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before.
26447,"MARGAERY: Have you spoken to him at all, the High Sparrow?"
26448,"TOMMEN: Yes, a few times. Have you?"
26449,"MARGAERY: Yes, I have. He’s not quite what we thought he was, is he?"
26450,NARRATOR:TOMMEN scrunches up his face. MARGAERY chuckles and turns away.
26451,MARGAERY: You think I’m mad. I sound mad.
26452,MARGAERY: He is. There’s something about him. His way of looking at the world. It’s not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are. It’s taken me a while. He’s helped me.
26453,TOMMEN: What are you talking about? You’re a good person. You’ve always been a good person. You’re the best person I know.
26454,NARRATOR:MARGAERY chuckles and retrieves her book from the bench.
26455,TOMMEN: I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor.
26456,"MARGAERY: Ah, yes, I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it. I never gave them what they really needed, though. I’ve had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good. All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did. There were so many lies in those stories."
26457,TOMMEN: I don’t understand.
26458,NARRATOR:MARGAERY rushes to TOMMEN and takes his hand.
26459,MARGAERY: It’s all right. It really is. It’s such a relief to let go of those lies.
26460,NARRATOR:MARGAERY leads him to the bench and they sit down on it together.
26461,TOMMEN: What about Loras?
26462,"MARGAERY: I love my brother. I will always love my brother. His soul is pure and perfect. His sins don’t erase that purity, they only obscure it. He just needs to atone for them. We all do. Sooner or later, one way or another. The gods have a plan for us all."
26463,GILLY: It’s hard to walk in this.
26464,SAM: It’s beautiful. You’re beautiful.
26465,NARRATOR:GILLY takes SAM’s arm and they walk down the hall together.
26466,"NARRATOR:SAM, GILLY, MELESSA, TALLA, DICKON, and RANDYLL are sitting around the dinner table eating. RANDYLL takes a bite and stares at SAM. GILLY looks around at others using their utensils and mimics them. SAM looks at DICKON."
26467,"SAM: This venison, it’s very tasty. Is it from today’s hunt?"
26468,"DICKON: Well, no. We haven’t been able to cure that one yet. This is last week’s."
26469,"SAM: Oh, of course. Sorry. Long journey."
26470,DICKON: Brought it down from 70 yards. One shot.
26471,"SAM: Oh, that’s a fair distance."
26472,DICKON: So do you do much hunting up at the wall?
26473,"SAM: Oh, yes. Yes. A good amount. North of the Wall, you don’t hunt, you don’t eat."
26474,DICKON: Mm-hmmm. Mostly deer or is it elk as well?
26475,"MELESSA (to GILLY): I imagine it’s common where you’re from. We once met a man, Lord Umber from Last Hearth, wasn’t it, Randyll, who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt."
26476,TALLA: Your father taught you to hunt? Our father would never teach us. I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father.
26477,RANDYLL: That’s enough of that.
26478,"MELESSA: Samwell, would you care for more bread?"
26479,"SAM: Oh, yes. Yes, please. Thank you, Mother."
26480,NARRATOR:A servant girl retrieves the basket of bread. She holds out the basket to SAM. SAM reaches for the bread.
26481,RANDYLL: Not fat enough already?
26482,NARRATOR:SAM waves the servant away.
26483,RANDYLL: I read your letter. You’re to be a maester.
26484,"SAM: Yes. And once I have my chain, I’ll return to Castle Black."
26485,RANDYLL: I thought the Night’s Watch might make a man of you. Something resembling a man at least. You managed to stay soft and fat.
26486,NARRATOR:SAM puts down his utensils.
26487,RANDYLL: Your nose buried in books. Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men. I’ll wager you still can’t sit a horse or wield a sword.
26488,"MELESSA: Randyll, to be maester of the Night’s Watch is a great honor."
26489,GILLY: He can wield a sword. He killed a Thenn. He killed a White Walker.
26490,NARRATOR:DICKON laughs.
26491,DICKON: There’s no such thing.
26492,GILLY: I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black. He drove a dagger into the walker’s heart. He risked his own life to save mine more than once. He’s a greater warrior than either of you will ever be.
26493,RANDYLL: Your way down to Castle Black? Where did he kill a white walker? Where are you from? How’d you come to meet my son?
26494,GILLY: The Night’s Watch came to our keep.
26495,RANDYLL: Where?

To him. He will never wield that sword. If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill, it would be the end of this house. I took you for a Mole’s Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that. Who else would have him? But I overestimated him. No. It was a wildling whore that seduced my son.

26635,"IZEMBARO: You have ideas, I have ideas, he has ideas. Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because I’ve been doing this my whole life? Who is anyone to judge my work? This is my profession. I know what I’m doing."
26636,NARRATOR:IZEMBARO removes his wig.
26637,IZEMBARO: You have no right to an opinion.

26674,JAIME: You already insulted one great house. It won’t happen twice. Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street.
26675,HIGH SPARROW: To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us. We yearn for it. But there is no call for it today. There will be no walk of atonement.

26700,"BLACK WALDER: Yes, father."
26701,"WALDER: It’s a castle, not a bloody sheep. Presumably you still know where it is. You didn’t lose Riverrun. You let the Blackfish take it from you."
26702,LOTHAR: He surprised us. He knows the castle better than anyone.
26703,"WALDER: You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding. You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave. Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him, you couldn’t find him. That’s what it means to lose something. Now he’s come back and taken Riverrun."
26704,"WALDER: For 300 years we kissed Tully boots, swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners. Not again. Riverrun is ours. Take it back."

26718,"NARRATOR:WALDER pulls his daughter into his lap. The servants return, ushering in a man bound in chains. They undo his chains. The man is EDMURE TULLY. EDMURE stares at WALDER."
26719,"WALDER: Cheer up, Lord Edmure. You’re going home."
26720,JAIME: I’m being sent to deal with the Blackfish. Apparently Walder Frey can’t manage it on his own because he’s 400 years old. Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months.
26721,NARRATOR:JAIME stands and paces.
26722,CERSEI: BEtter you’re elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons.

26727,CERSEI: You can’t.
26728,JAIME: He has our son! He stole our son! He’s torn our family apart. How should we treat people who tear us apart?
26729,"CERSEI: We should treat them without mercy and we will. But if you kill the High Sparrow, you won’t leave the sept alive. And without you, this is all for nothing. Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you. Show our men where their loyalties belong. Show them what lannisters are, what we do to our enemies. And take that stupid little castle back because it’s ours and because you can."
26730,JAIME: You’ll stand trial soon. I need to he here for you.
26731,"CERSEI: It will be a trial by combat. I have the Mountain. They’ve made us both stronger, all of them."

26749,BRAN: How?
26750,BENJEN: The same way they made the Walkers in the first place. You saw it yourself.

26764,DAENERYS: How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros?
26765,DAENERYS: And who has that many?
26766,DAARIO: Nobody.
26767,DAENERYS: Nobody yet.
26768,DAARIO: So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros. What then?
26769,DAENERYS: I take what is mine.
26770,DAARIO: You weren’t made to sit on a chair in a palance.
26771,DAENERYS: What was I made for?
26772,"DAARIO: You’re a conqueror, Daenerys Stormborn."
26773,NARRATOR:The wind howls. DAENERYS stares beyond the mountain crag
26774,DAENERYS: Wait here.
26775,NARRATOR:DAENERYS rides away from the horde and around the bend. Time passes. The Dothraki are growing antsy.
26776,DAARIO (speaking Dothraki): I’m going after her. Wait for me here.
26777,"NARRATOR:DAARIO starts off, but stops when a dragon’s roar erupts from the sky. The Dothraki look around. The shadow of a dragon appears on the mountainside. DROGON flies over the Dothraki horde with DAENERYS on its back. DROGON circles around and lands in front of the horde. He roars."
26778,DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki):  Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way. But I am not a khal. I will not choose three blood riders. I choose you all.
26779,NARRATOR:The Dothraki cheer.
26780,DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar! Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea?
26781,NARRATOR:The Dothraki cheer.
26782,DAENERYS: Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses?
26783,NARRATOR:The Dothraki cheer.
26784,"DAENERYS: Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms, the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains?"
26785,NARRATOR:The Dothraki cheer.

26787,NARRATOR:The Dothraki continue to cheer.

26792,MAN #2: Steady. Steady.
26793,"NARRATOR:BROTHER RAY is standing beneath the framing, addressing two men who are hoisting up a log."
26794,RAY: Up she goes.
26795,NARRATOR:RAY turns to another man and slaps him on the back.
26796,"RAY: Hey, come on. Put your back into it, huh?"
26797,"NARRATOR:RAY walks a few paces away, grabs an ax, and lifts it up to a man standing on the church framing."
26798,"RAY: Here you are, son."
26799,NARRATOR:The man standing on the framing takes the ax. RAY turns to see two men carrying a log into the opening beneath the framing. He waves them in.
26800,"RAY: Oh, gentlemen, please."
26801,NARRATOR:RAY walks out from beneath the framing and addresses more men carrying logs.
26802,"NARRATOR:RAY. And you lot, come on. Come on, get it moving. Come on, come on."
26803,"NARRATOR:RAY hurries beneath one of the logs and laughs. He turns and looks up at the church framing, smiles, and nods. In a field a little ways off, more men are carrying larger logs towards the church framing. Four men carry each log. A man carrying one of these heavy logs by himself comes into view. He drops the log in front of the church framing and pants, then turns to look out over the landscape. The man is SANDOR CLEGANE, The Hound."
26804,RAY: In all my days I’ve never seen a man swing an ax like that. How many men did it take to cut you down?
26805,SANDOR: Just one.
26806,RAY: Ooh. he must have been some kind of monster.
26807,NARRATOR:SANDOR sinks the ax into the log.
26808,SANDOR: He was a woman.
26809,NARRATOR:RAY laughs. SANDOR continues chopping. RAY walks away.
26810,CUT TO: BROTHER RAY’S ENCAMPMENT
26811,"NARRATOR:A man standing beneath the church framing rings a bell. All of  the men rush down off the church framing and father at the food stations. The women divvy out food. RAY pours a cup of water and walks among the people. They are all sitting down on the ground and eating. SANDOR is sitting on a rock away from everyone else, eating. RAY approaches him from behind and hands him the cup of water. SANDOR takes it."
26812,RAY: I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you.
26813,SANDOR: I’m used to it.
26814,NARRATOR:SANDOR drinks the entire cup of water.
26815,"RAY: When I found you, I thought you’d been dead for days. The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there."
26816,NARRATOR:RAY sits down next to SANDOR and points at SANDOR’s right knee.
26817,"RAY: I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed. Oh, nearly shit myself. I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon, but you didn’t. Now, I reckoned you’d die a dozen more times over the next few days, but you didn’t. What kept you going?"
26818,NARRATOR:SANDOR pauses and stares ahead.
26819,SANDOR: Hate.
26820,NARRATOR:SANDOR continues eating.
26821,"RAY: No, there’s a reason you’re still here."
26822,"SANDOR: Aye, there’s a reason. I’m a big fucker and I’m tough to kill."
26823,"RAY: No, a reason. Gods aren’t done with you yet."
26824,"NARRATOR:SANDOR smiles. RAY stands and walks a few paces away from SANDOR, then turns to face him."
26825,"SANDOR: I’ve heard that before. Man was talking about a different god, though."
26826,"RAY: Well, maybe he was right. I don’t know much about the gods."
26827,SANDOR: You’re in the wrong line of work.
26828,"RAY: Oh, there’s plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods. I don’t. I don’t even know their real names. Maybe it is the Seven. Or maybe it’s the old gods. Or maybe it’s the Lord of Light. Or maybe they’re all the same fucking thing. I don’t know. What matters, I believe, is that there’s something greater than us. And whatever it is, it’s got plans for Sandor Clegane."
26829,NARRATOR:SANDOR stops eating and stares up at RAY. RAY nods at him.
26830,SANDOR: You didn’t know me back in my time. You don’t know the things I’ve done.
26831,RAY: I’ve heard stories.
26832,SANDOR: If the gods are real...why haven’t they punished me?
26833,RAY: They have.
26834,NARRATOR:RAY walks away. SANDOR stares out across the fields.
26835,HIGH SPARROW: Your Grace. What are we reading today?
26836,"MARGAERY: The Book of the Mother, Your Holiness. Chapter three, verse 12."
26837,"MARGAERY: “Smoothing what was jagged, so does a woman’s love calm a man’s brute nature. A wife salves her husband’s wounds, a mother sings her son to sleep.”"
26838,"HIGH SPARROW: You learn quickly. There are some who know every verse of the sacred text, but don’t have a drop of the Mother’s mercy in their blood and savages who can’t read at all who understand the Father’s wisdom."
26839,"MARGAERY: For year I pretended to love the poor, the afflicted. I had pity for them, but I never loved them. They disgusted me."
26840,HIGH SPARROW: They are hard to love.
26841,NARRATOR:The HIGH SPARROW sits down on a bench.
26842,"HIGH SPARROW: The poor disgust us because they are us, shorn of our illusions. They show us what we’d look like without our fine clothes. How’d we smell without perfume."
26843,NARRATOR:The HIGH SPARROW sighs.
26844,HIGH SPARROW: Can I ask you about a personal matter?
26845,MARGAERY: Of course.
26846,NARRATOR:MARGAERY sits on the bench beside the HIGH SPARROW.
26847,"HIGH SPARROW: The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven’t joined him in the marriage bed."
26848,MARGAERY: No.
26849,"HIGH SPARROW: You have a duty, Your Grace. To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves."
26850,MARGAERY: It’s just...the desires that once drove me no longer do.
26851,"HIGH SPARROW: Congress does not require desire on the woman’s part, only patience. The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work."
26852,MARGAERY: Forgive me. Sometimes the truth path is hard to find.
26853,HIGH SPARROW: Hard to find and harder still to walk upon. But you’ve made great progress. I only pray your grandmother follows your lead.
26854,NARRATOR:The HIGH SPARROW stands.
26855,MARGAERY: My grandmother?
26856,"HIGH SPARROW: Yes. The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman, a strong woman, and an unrepentant sinner. You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old. Or I fear for her safety, body and soul."
26857,"NARRATOR:MARGAERY and OLENNA are sitting at a table. SEPTA UNELLA stands several feet away, watching them."
26858,OLENNA: Does it move or talk? I want to speak with you alone.
26859,MARGAERY: Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor.
26860,NARRATOR:OLENNA stands.
26861,"OLENNA: Oh, this is madness!"
26862,NARRATOR:OLENNA takes MARGAERY’s hand and leads her out onto the balcony to a different table. SEPTA UNELLA follows them out. MARGAERY sits at the table.
26863,"OLENNA (to SEPTA UNELLA): You’re not in your sanctuary now, my dear. All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about..."
26864,MARGAERY: Grandmother.
26865,OLENNA: ...until I tell them to stop. If I tell them to stop. You could use a good bashing.
26866,"MARGAERY: Grandmother, please."
26867,NARRATOR:OLENNA sits across from MARGAERY.
26868,OLENNA: What have they done to you?
26869,"MARGAERY: You marched against the High Sparrow, against the Faith."
26870,OLENNA: We marched for you.
26871,"MARGAERY: The gods could have punished you and Father, but they didn’t. They showed mercy."
26872,OLENNA: And what about your brother? What mercy did they show him?
26873,"MARGAERY: Loras’s only hope is to confess his crimes and repent. If he does, the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden. He’ll have to renounce his name and title..."
26874,OLENNA: Have you lost your mind?
26875,MARGAERY: ...and live his life as a penitent.
26876,"OLENNA: He is the heir to Highgarden, the future of House Tyrell."
26877,MARGAERY: He can begin again.
26878,OLENNA: As a mindless fanatic.
26879,MARGAERY: As a free man.
26880,OLENNA: You will leave for Highgarden today. There is no law that says you must stay here.
26881,NARRATOR:MARGAERY stands.
26882,MARGAERY: I am the queen. It is my duty to serve my husband the king.
26883,NARRATOR:MARGAERY walks around the table and kneels before OLENNA. Her back is to SEPTA UNELLA.
26884,"MARGAERY: But you should leave, Grandmother. Your place is at home."
26885,OLENNA: I will never leave you. Never.
26886,MARGAERY: You must.
26887,NARRATOR:MARGAERY slips a piece of paper into OLENNA’s hand. MARGAERY’s eyes widen.
26888,MARGAERY: Go home. Find comfort in prayer and good works.
26889,NARRATOR:MARGAERY stands.
26890,MARGAERY: The Mother watches over us all.
26891,NARRATOR:OLENNA stands.
26892,"OLENNA: I’ll see you soon, my dear."
26893,NARRATOR:MARGAERY and OLENNA embrace. MARGAERY closes her eyes and then steps back.
26894,"MARGAERY: Seven blessings to you, Grandmother."
26895,NARRATOR:OLENNA nods and walks back into her chamber. MARGAERY stifles tears. She regains her composure and turns to face SEPTA UNELLA.
26896,MARGAERY: Shall we pray?
26897,NARRATOR:OLENNA walks out onto the balcony and shuts the door behind her. She looks around and then unfolds the piece of paper MARGAERY placed in her hand and looks at it. There is a drawing of a rose on it. OLENNA looks up and smiles.
26898,"DIM DALBA: We said we’d fight with you, King Crow, when the time comes and we meant it, but this isn’t what we agreed to. These aren’t White Walkers. This isn’t an army of the dead. This isn’t our find."
26899,"TORMUND: If it weren’t for him, none of us would be here. All of you would be meat in the Night King’s army. And I’d be a pile of charred bones just like Mance."
26900,"DIM DALBA: Remember Mance’s camp? It stretched all the way to the horizon. And look at us now. Look what’s left of us. And if we lose this, we’re gone. Dozens of tribes, hundreds of generations. Be like we were never there at all. We’ll be the last of the free folk."
26901,"JON SNOW: That’s what’ll happen to you if we lose. The Boltons, the Karstarks, the Umbers, they know you’re here. They know that more than half of you are women and children. After they finish with me, they’ll come for you. You’re right. This isn’t your fight. You shouldn’t have to come to Winterfell with me. I shouldn’t be asking you. It’s not the deal we made. I need you with me if we’re gonna beat them, and we need to beat them if you’re going to survive."
26902,NARRATOR:TORMUND gestures to JON SNOW.
26903,"TORMUND: The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would. He died for us. If we are not willing to do the same for him, we’re cowards. And if that’s what we are, we deserve to be the last of the free folk."
26904,NARRATOR:WUN WUN stands.
26905,WUN WUN: Snow.
26906,NARRATOR:WUN WUN walks away. DIM DALBA looks at the men around him. One of them nods. DIM DALBA walks up to JON SNOW and holds out his hand. JON takes it. DIM DALBA returns to his men.
26907,JON SNOW (to TORMUND): Are you sure they’ll come?
26908,"TORMUND: We’re not clever like you southerners. When we say we’ll do something, we do it."
26909,NARRATOR:JON SNOW exhales.
26910,CERSEI: I heard you were leaving King’s Landing.
26911,OLENNA: That is hardly your concern.
26912,CERSEI: Your grandson is still a prisoner. You’ll leave him rotting in a cell?
26913,OLENNA: Loras rots in a cell because of you. THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you. Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity.
26914,CERSEI: You’re right. I made a terrible mistake. I carry it with me every single day.
26915,OLENNA: Good.
26916,CERSEI: I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep. And now we must fight them together. We need each other.
26917,"OLENNA: I wonder if you’re the worst person I’ve ever met. At a certain age, it’s hard to recall. But the truly vile do stand out through the years. Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells? I do. I’ll never forget it."
26918,CERSEI: You love your granddaughter. I love my son. It’s the only truth I know. We must defend them.
26919,"OLENNA: I’m leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells. If you’re half as bright as you think you are, you’ll find your way out of here, too."
26920,CERSEI: Never. I’ll never leave my son.
26921,"OLENNA: What’ll you do, then? You have no support. Not anymore. Your brother’s gone. The High Sparrow saw to that. The rest of your family have abandoned you. The people despise you. You’re surrounded by enemies, thousands of them. You’re going to kill them all by yourself? You’ve lost, Cersei. It’s the only joy I can find in all this misery."
26922,NARRATOR:OLENNA goes back to writing.
26923,MAN: Pick the pace up. Keep going.
26924,MAN #2: Keep it moving!
26925,"BRONN: Now, that is a sorry attempt at a siege. Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches."
26926,JAIME: Someone certainly does.
26927,NARRATOR:JAIME looks at BRONN.
26928,"BRONN: Oh, no. Not me. I’m just an upjumped sellsword."
26929,JAIME: You’re an anointed knight. There’s quite a difference.
26930,"BRONN: Aye, knights don’t get paid."
26931,JAIME: You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army.
26932,BRONN: That’s like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army.
26933,JAIME: I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long. You can be the right hand I lost.
26934,BRONN: You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife.
26935,BRONN: Don’t say it. Don’t fucking say it.
26936,NARRATOR:BRONN ushers his horse onwards.
26937,"NARRATOR:JAIME and BRONN lead a group of Lannister soldiers through the encampment. Some Frey men gather around and stare at them. LOTHAR is standing at the foot of Riverrun, shouting up at the castle walls. BLACK WALDER is behind him, standing on a makeshift hangman’s platform. EDMURE is also on the platform with a noose around his neck. JAIME and BRONN watch them."
26938,"LOTHAR: Come out and fight us, Blackfish. Yield the castle or we’ll hang him."
26939,"NARRATOR:BRYNDEN TULLY, the Blackfish, walks along Riverrun’s castle wall and comes to a stop in front of an arrowslit. He stares out at LOTHAR, BLACK WALDER, and EDMURE."
26940,LOTHAR: This is your last warning. Yield the castle.
26941,NARRATOR:LOTHAR looks back at BLACK WALDER. BLACK WALDER takes the noose off of EDMURE’s neck and draws a knife.
26942,"BLACK WALDER: You think I won’t do it, old man?"
26943,NARRATOR:BLACK WALDER holds the knife to EDMURE’s neck.
26944,BLACK WALDER: I sliced your niece’s throat from ear to ear. And where were you? Running and hiding like a fucking coward. Yield the castle or I cut his throat.
26945,"BRYNDEN: Go on, then. Cut his throat."
26946,"NARRATOR:BRYNDEN walks away. LOTHAR looks at BLACK WALDER and shrugs. BLACK WALDER takes the knife away from EDMURE’s neck. Some Frey men take EDMURE away. JAIME, BRONN, and the Lannister army advance towards LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER, and stop in front of them."
26947,"JAIME: Lothar, is it?"
26948,LOTHAR: Ser Jaime. We didn’t know you were coming.
26949,"JAIME: ‘Cause you didn’t set up a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged."
26950,BRONN: Good thing we’re friends or we’d be fucking you in the ass right now.
26951,JAIME: Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.
26952,NARRATOR:BLACK WALDER waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.
26953,"BLACK WALDER: Whoa, whoa."
26954,NARRATOR:The Frey men stop walking. BLACK WALDER approaches JAIME.
26955,LOTHAR: Walder.
26956,"NARRATOR:LOTHAR puts his hand out to stop BLACK WALDER, but BLACK WALDER pushes him away. BLACK WALDER walks up to JAIME."
26957,BLACK WALDER: Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey.
26958,NARRATOR:JAIME looks BLACK WALDER up and down.
26959,"JAIME: Only a fool makes threats he’s not prepared to carry out. Now let’s say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth, but you kept talking. What do you think I’d do?"
26960,NARRATOR:JAIME hits BLACK WALDER across the face with his gold hand. BLACK WALDER staggers back beside LOTHAR.
26961,JAIME: I’m here by the king’s command to take back this castle. Have him bathed and fed. Unless you’d like to take his place.
26962,"LOTHAR: Apologies, Ser Jaime."
26963,NARRATOR:LOTHAR waves at the Frey men escorting EDMURE.
26964,LOTHAR: Do as he says.
26965,"JAIME: The siege is now under my command. The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts, he’ll see an army at his gates, not whatever this is."
26966,BRONN: Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches. Set pickets every hundred yards. And work double-time on those siege towers and trebuchets.
26967,"JAIME: As I said, the siege is under my command. If that’s not to your liking, go home."
26968,NARRATOR:LOTHAR and BLACK WALDER walk away. BRONN walks up behind JAIME.
26969,JAIME: Get word to the Blackfish. I want a parley.
26970,BRONN: A parley or a fight?
26971,JAIME: He’s an old man.
26972,BRONN: You’ve got one hand. My money’s on the old boy.
26973,NARRATOR:EXT. BEAR ISLANDThe castle of House Mormont sits atop a high hill. Waterfalls pour out below. A bird screeches.
26974,"NARRATOR:LYANNA MORMONT sits at a high table flanked by a commander and a maester. JON SNOW, SANSA, and DAVOS enter. Some guards close the doors behind them."
26975,JON SNOW: Lady Mormont.
26976,LYANNA: Welcome to Bear Island.
26977,NARRATOR:JON SNOW looks at SANSA.
26978,"SANSA: I remember when you were born, my lady. You were named for my Aunt Lyanna. It was said she was a great beauty. I’m sure you will be, too."
26979,"LYANNA: I doubt it. My mother wasn’t a great beauty or any other kind of beauty. She was a great warrior, though. She died fighting for your brother, Robb."
26980,LYANNA: I think we’ve had enough small talk. What are you here?
26981,LYANNA: I remember what it said. “Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark.”
26982,"JON SNOW: Robb is gone, but House Stark is not. And it needs your support now more than ever. I’ve come with my sister to ask for House Mormont’s allegiance."
26983,NARRATOR:LYANNA leans towards her maester. They whisper to each other. LYANNA turns back to face JON SNOW.
26984,"LYANNA: As far as I understand, you’re a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton. Or is she a Lannister? I’ve heard conflicting reports."
26985,"SANSA: I did what I had to do to survive, my lady. But I am a Stark. I will always be a Stark."
26986,"LYANNA: If you say so. In any case, you don’t just want my allegiance. You want my fighting men."
26987,LYANNA: I understand that I’m responsible for Bear Island and all who live here. So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone else’s war?
26988,NARRATOR:JON SNOW and SANSA fall silent. DAVOS steps forward.
26989,"DAVOS: If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel."
26990,"LYANNA: I don’t know you, Ser…?"
26991,"DAVOS: Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth."
26992,NARRATOR:LYANNA turns to her maester.
26993,DAVOS: You needn’t ask your maester about my house. It’s rather new.
26994,NARRATOR:LYANNA settles back into her chair.
26995,"LYANNA: All right, Ser Davos of House Seaworth. How is it you understand how I feel?"
26996,"DAVOS: You never thought you’d find yourself in your position. Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age. I never thought I’d be in my position. I was a crabber’s son, then I was a smuggler. And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war. But I’m here because this isn’t someone else’s war. It’s our war."
26997,"LYANNA: Go on, Ser Davos."
26998,"DAVOS: Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward. He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life. Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn’t between a few squabbling houses. It’s between the living and the dead. And make no mistake, my lady, the dead are coming."
26999,LYANNA: Is this true?
27000,NARRATOR:JON SNOW nods.
27001,JON SNOW: Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men. I fought them at Hardhome. We both lost.
27002,"DAVOS: As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell, the North is divided. And a divided North won’t stand a chance against the Night King. You want to protect your people, my lady. I understand. But there’s no hiding from this. We have to fight and we need to do it together."
27003,"NARRATOR:LYANNA’s maester leans over to whisper in her ear, but she waves him away."
27004,"LYANNA: House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1,000 years. We will not break faith today."
27005,"JON SNOW: Thank you, my lady. How many fighting men can we expect?"
27006,NARRATOR:LYANNA leans to her military commander and they whisper to each other.
27007,LYANNA: 62.
27008,JON SNOW: 62?
27009,"LYANNA: We are not a large house, but we’re a proud one. And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders."
27010,"DAVOS: If they’re half as ferocious as their lady, the Boltons are doomed."
27011,NARRATOR:LYANNA smiles and nods.
27012,BRYNDEN: Kingslayer.
27013,JAIME: Blackfish.
27014,BRYNDEN: I assume you’re here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece. I don’t see Sansa and Arya.
27015,JAIME: I don’t have them.
27016,BRYNDEN: Pity. Do you wish to resume your captivity?
27017,NARRATOR:JAIME shakes his head.

27025,"JAIME: We’ll breach them and kill every last one of you. But if you surrender, I’ll spare the lives of your men. On my honor."
27026,BRYNDEN: Your honor? Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand.
27027,"JAIME: The war is over, ser. Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause?"
27028,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN turns to face JAIME and walks close to him.
27029,"BRYNDEN: As long as I’m standing, the war is not over. This is my home. I was born in this castle and I’m ready to die in it. So you can either attack or try to starve us out. We have enough provisions for two years. Do you have two years, Kingslayer?"
27030,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN walks past JAIME and continues back across the drawbridge.
27031,JAIME: You clearly have no intention of saving your men’s lives. Why did you come to treat with me?
27032,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN turns back to face JAIME.
27033,"BRYNDEN: Sieges are dull. And I wanted to see you in person, get the measure of you."

27039,ROBETT: I’ve heard enough. We’ve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn. The Boltons helped us do it. Now you want me to fight against them? I could be skinned for even talking to you.
27040,ROBETT: Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you?
27041,JON SNOW: House Mormont.
27042,ROBETT: And?
27043,ROBETT: I don’t care about ravens. You’re asking me to join your army. Who is fighting in this army?

27045,NARRATOR:ROBETT laughs.
27046,ROBETT: Then the rumors are true. I didn’t dare believe them. I received you out of respect for your father. Now I would like you to leave. House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings.
27047,NARRATOR:ROBETT turns around and heads up the stairs towards a door attended by his men.

27053,NARRATOR:ROBETT gets closer to SANSA.
27054,ROBETT: And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle? When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects? Taking up with a foreign whore. Getting himself and those who followed him killed.

27056,"ROBETT: I served House Stark once, but House Stark is dead."

27096,DAVOS: Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell.
27097,SANSA: And that’s a good thing?
27098,DAVOS: He was the most experienced commander in Westeros. He chose this place for a reason. Those mountains are a natural fortification. There’s a stream down there for the horses.
27099,JON SNOW: We’re not staying here long. Another storm could hit any day..
27100,"DAVOS: Aye, the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did."

27126,"RAY: I was a soldier once. All my superiors thought I was brave. I wasn’t. I mean, I never ran from a fight. Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid. That’s all I was, a coward. We followed orders no matter the orders. Burn that village. Fine, I’m your arsonist. Steal that farmer’s crops. Good, I’m your thief. Kill those young lads so they won’t take up arms against us. I’m your murderer. I remember once a woman screaming at us, calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut. But we weren’t animals. Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours. I cut that young boy’s throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back."
27127,NARRATOR:RAY sits down on a stump next to one of the men and rests his arm on the man’s shoulder.

27131,NARRATOR:RAY stands and walks back to the center of the circle.
27132,"RAY: Now, I know I can never bring that lad back. All I can do with time I’ve got left is bring a little goodness into the world. That’s all any of us can do, isn’t it? Never too late to stop robbing people, to stop killing people. Start helping people."
27133,NARRATOR:RAY stares at SANDOR.
27134,RAY: It’s never too late to come back.
27135,NARRATOR:SANDOR returns RAY’s gaze but is distracted by three horsemen coming up the way. RAY turns to look at them. SANDOR walks a few paces into the midst of RAY’s followers and stares at the riders.
27136,RAY: And it’s not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers. It’s not even about the gods. It’s about you. Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself.
27137,"NARRATOR:The three riders reach the group and stop. RAY walks out to meet them. All of RAY’s followers stand. The riders are FLYNN, MORGAN, and LEM LEMONCLOAK."

27142,"RAY: Well, we thank you for your protection. Who are you protecting us from?"
27143,LEM: Do you have any horses?
27144,RAY: No horses. No gold. No steel.
27145,"LEM: Food, then. Protecting the people is hungry work."
27146,"RAY: I’m sure it is. You’re welcome to stay for supper, but we have hungry mouths here."

27151,RAY: I’m a fucking septon. What was I supposed to say?
27152,SANDOR: They don’t believe in your Seven. They’re from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.
27153,"RAY: Aye, well, all are welcome here. Anyway, we got nothing for them."
27154,NARRATOR:SANDOR stops chopping.
27155,"SANDOR: Sure, you do. You’ve got food, you’ve got steel even if you say you don’t. And you’ve got women."
27156,RAY: What do you want to do? Fight them? Kill them?
27157,NARRATOR:SANDOR shrugs and sighs.
27158,"RAY: It’d be you against all of them. I mean, these people don’t know how to fight."
27159,SANDOR: You do.
27160,RAY: I’m done with fighting.
27161,SANDOR: Even if it’s to protect yourself?
27162,RAY: Violence is a disease. You don’t cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
27163,"SANDOR: You don’t cure it by dying, either."
27164,NARRATOR:SANDOR resumes chopping.
27165,RAY: You’ve done enough work for one day. Come on up for some supper.
27166,NARRATOR:RAY starts back up the path.

27196,NARRATOR:LADY CRANE stands and carries her tray of medical supplies into the abutting room.

27285,NARRATOR:QYBURN says nothing.
27286,CERSEI: The king is aware of their presence?
27287,"QYBURN: He is, Your Grace. He’s currently in his chambers at prayer."
27288,"NARRATOR:CERSEI stands and walks past QYBURN out into the hall. QYBURN bows to her as she passes, then follows her out with GREGOR in tow. At the bottom of the steps, LANCEL and a group of Faith Militant are waiting. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR approach them. One of the Faith Militant stares up at GREGOR."
27289,"LANCEL: Your Grace, His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor."
27290,CERSEI: His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep.
27291,"LANCEL: Your Grace, this is not a request."
27292,"CERSEI: It is a request, Cousin Lancel. You are asking me for something, I’m refusing."
27293,LANCEL: The High Septon commands you. Are you sure you want to refuse him?
27294,CERSEI: He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial.
27295,CERSEI: Get out.
27296,NARRATOR:LANCEL nods at the Faith Militant. Two of them advance with spikes clubs. GREGOR steps in front of CERSEI.
27297,"LANCEL (to GREGOR): Move aside, ser."
27298,NARRATOR:GREGOR silently stares out from behind his helmet.
27299,LANCEL (to CERSEI): Order your man to step aside or there will be violence.
27300,CERSEI: I choose violence.
27301,"NARRATOR:One of the Faith Militant swings his club into GREGOR’s chestplate. GREGOR is unaffected. The club is stuck in the metal of the armor and the Faith Militant man struggles to wrench it free. He pulls it loose and reels back for another swing, but GREGOR takes him by the throat with one hand and lifts him up off the ground. LANCEL and the other Faith Militant regroup in the courtyard. The man in GREGOR’s grasp gasps and drops his club. GREGOR tosses him out into the courtyard, then follows him out. GREGOR kneels over the man, grabs him by the jaw, and rips his head off. LANCEL looks around at the other Faith Militant. CERSEI smiles."
27302,CERSEI: Please tell His High Holiness he’s always welcome to visit.
27303,"NARRATOR:CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR turn to walk back up the steps."
27304,NARRATOR:EXT. RIVERRUNBRIENNE and PODRICK arrive on horseback. They stare out at the Lannister/Frey encampment from an overlooking hill.
27305,"PODRICK: Looks like a siege, my lady."
27306,"BRIENNE: You have a keen military mind, Pod."
27307,NARRATOR:BRIENNE spots JAIME riding a white horse among his men.
27308,PODRICK: My lady. My lady.
27309,"NARRATOR:Several Lannister soldiers ride towards BRIENNE and PODRICK, and then encircle them."
27310,MAN: Who goes there? State your business!
27311,BRIENNE: My name is Brienne of Tarth. Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister I’ve come to speak with him. Tell him I have his sword.
27312,NARRATOR:PODRICK watches Lannister soldiers riding through the encampment. His is choked from behind by an unknown man who reveals himself to be BRONN.
27313,"BRONN: Getting a bit old to be a squire, aren’t we?"
27314,NARRATOR:BRONN releases PODRICK. PODRICK coughs. BRONN laughs and slaps PODRICK on the shoulder.
27315,BRONN: Podrick fucking Payne. I thought you’d be dead by now.
27316,PODRICK: Not yet.
27317,NARRATOR:BRONN laughs and motions to a nearby tent.
27318,BRONN: Are they in there?
27319,PODRICK: Mm-hmm.
27320,BRONN: You think they’re fucking?
27321,PODRICK: What? No.
27322,"BRONN: Why not? I’d fuck her. You’d fuck her, wouldn’t you?"
27323,PODRICK: I’m her squire.
27324,"BRONN: Oh. Well, he’d fuck her, that’s for sure. And she’s fuck him, don’t you think? The way she looks at him. The way all women look at him is frankly irritating. I preferred working with the little brother on that account. Come on, you’re the one with the magic cock."
27325,NARRATOR:BRONN grabs PODRICK’s crotch.
27326,BRONN: You must have shown it to her by now.
27327,PODRICK: She’s training me to fight.
27328,BRONN: Is she? Oh.
27329,"PODRICK: An hour in the morning, and hour at night. Every day."
27330,BRONN: Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you?
27331,"PODRICK: Well, that’s a different sort of fighting."
27332,"BRONN: Now, that’s the truth, isn’t it? You want to learn that sort of fighting?"
27333,NARRATOR:PODRICK smiles and nods.
27334,"BRONN: All right, let’s start with your footwork."
27335,NARRATOR:BRONN stands across from PODRICK.
27336,BRONN: Show me your stance.
27337,NARRATOR:PODRICK postures up.
27338,"BRONN: Now, listen to me, Pod. See how your feet are about a yard apart?"
27339,NARRATOR:PODRICK looks down at his feet. BRONN slaps him across the face.
27340,"BRONN: Lesson number one, assume everyone wants to hit you. ‘Cause they do, Pod. Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire. Do it again. Come on, don’t sulk."
27341,CUT TO: JAIME’S TENT
27342,NARRATOR:BRIENNE and JAIME stand across from each other.
27343,JAIME: I never thought you’d find her. I just assumed Sansa was dead.
27344,BRIENNE: Why would you assume that?
27345,"JAIME: In my experience, girls like her don’t live very long."
27346,BRIENNE: I don’t think you know many girls like her.
27347,"JAIME: Well, I’m proud of you. I am. You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds."
27348,NARRATOR:JAIME walks around the room and comes to a stop on BRIENNE’s other side. BRIENNE turns to face him.
27349,"JAIME: Of course my sister wants Sansa dead. The girl is still a suspect in Joffrey’s murder, so there is that complication. What the hell are you doing here?"
27350,BRIENNE: I’ve come for the Blackfish.
27351,JAIME: You’re welcome to have him.
27352,BRIENNE: Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.
27353,JAIME: With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?
27354,BRIENNE: The Tully army.
27355,"JAIME: They’re a bit occupied at the moment. I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels, so you can see the conundrum."
27356,BRIENNE: The Tullys are rebels because they’re fighting for their home?
27357,JAIME: Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree.
27358,BRIENNE: As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family.
27359,JAIME: Exactly.
27360,NARRATOR:JAIME and BRIENNE stare at each other.
27361,JAIME: We shouldn’t argue about politics.
27362,"BRIENNE: You’re a knight, Ser Jaime. I know there is honor in you. I’ve seen it myself."
27363,JAIME: I’m a Lannister. Don’t ask me to betray my own house.
27364,BRIENNE: I do no such thing. Take Riverrun without bloodshed. Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact.
27365,JAIME: What do you propose?
27366,BRIENNE: Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce. Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle.
27367,JAIME: Why would he abandon his ancestral home?
27368,BRIENNE: Because you’ll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north.
27369,JAIME: Have you ever met the Blackfish?
27370,BRIENNE: No.
27371,JAIME: He’s even more stubborn than you are.
27372,NARRATOR:BRIENNE looks down. JAIME walks back around the table to BRIENNE’s other side.
27373,"JAIME: All right. Try to talk some sense into the old goat. He won’t listen, but his men might. Not everybody wants to die for someone else’s home."
27374,"BRIENNE: I need your word. If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you’ll grant us safe passage north."
27375,JAIME: You have my word. You have until nightfall.
27376,NARRATOR:BRIENNE nods and undoes her sword belt. She hands Oathkeeper to JAIME. JAIME sighs.
27377,BRIENNE: You gave it to me for a purpose. I’ve achieved that purpose.
27378,JAIME: It’s yours. It will always be yours.
27379,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE stares into JAIME’s eyes, then ties Oathkeeper back on her waist and begins to walk out. JAIME follows her to the entrance of the tent. BRIENNE turns back."
27380,"BRIENNE: one last thing, Ser Jaime."
27381,"JAIME: Yes, Lady Brienne?"
27382,"BRIENNE: Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender, and if you attack the castle, honor compels me to fight for Sansa’s kin."
27383,JAIME: Of course it does.
27384,BRIENNE: To fight you.
27385,JAIME: Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.
27386,NARRATOR:BRIENNE and JAIME stare into each other’s eyes. BRIENNE exits. JAIME watches her go.
27387,NARRATOR:BRIENNE and PODRICK follow BRYNDEN holding a piece of parchment as he walks along the walls of Riverrun.
27388,BRYNDEN: I’ve said no three times already.
27389,BRIENNE: I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark.
27390,BRYNDEN: I haven’t seen her since she was a child. I don’t know her signature. I don’t know you. And I will not surrender.
27391,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN turns to one of his soldiers.
27392,BRYNDEN: Double the guards tonight.
27393,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN looks out at the Lannister/Frey encampment.
27394,NARRATOR:BRYNDEL The Kingslayer wants to try us. I can feel it.
27395,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN turns on his heel and walks inside. BRIENNE and PODRICK follow him.
27396,"BRYNDEN: Yes, Brienne of Tarth. I know your father. A good man."
27397,BRIENNE: He always spoke highly of you.
27398,"BRYNDEN: And if he were here now, I’d tell him the same I’m telling you."
27399,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN makes his way down a set of steps.
27400,"BRYNDEN: If you think I’m abandoning my family’s seat on the Kingslayer’s word of honor, you’re a bloody fool."
27401,BRIENNE: Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys.
27402,BRYNDEN: We can stand longer than your one-handed friend thinks we can.
27403,"NARRATOR:BRYNDEN, BRIENNE, and PODRICK emerge into Riverrun’s main courtyard."
27404,BRIENNE: He’s not my friend.
27405,BRYNDEN: No?
27406,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN stops and turns back to face BRIENNE.
27407,BRYNDEN: Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle? Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel?
27408,"BRIENNE: Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark. He sent me to find Sansa, to help her as Catelyn wanted. He gave me this sword to protect her. That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die."
27409,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE holds out the piece of parchment to BRYNDEN. BRYNDEN takes it, unfolds it, and reads its contents. He smiles and chuckles under his breath."
27410,BRYNDEN: She’s exactly like her mother.
27411,NARRATOR:BRIENNE smiles. BRYNDEN turns back to face her.
27412,BRYNDEN: I don’t have enough men to help her take Winterfell.
27413,BRIENNE: You have more than she does.
27414,"BRYNDEN: She wants her home back. I understand that. But this is my home. And if Jaime Lannister wants it, he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does."
27415,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN hands the letter back to BRIENNE. She takes it. BRYNDEN walks away.
27416,BRIENNE (to PODRICK): Find the maester. We need to get a raven north to Sansa.
27417,PODRICK: What should I write?
27418,BRIENNE: Tell her I failed.
27419,CERSEI: There’s to be a royal announcement?
27420,KEVAN: There is.
27421,CERSEI: Why wasn’t I informed?
27422,KEVAN: There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment.
27423,NARRATOR:CERSEi starts up the steps but KEVAN blocks her with his arm.
27424,KEVAN: Where are you going?
27425,CERSEI: To stand by my son.
27426,KEVAN: Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court.
27427,"NARRATOR:CERSEI stares at TOMMEN. TOMMEN looks away. MAESTER PYCELLE whispers to him. CERSEI, QYBURN, and GREGOR move to one of the nearby balconies. TOMMEN sits on the Iron Throne and addresses the crowd."
27428,"TOMMEN: Lords and ladies, the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world. One collapses, so does the other. The Father judges us all. If you break his laws...you will be punished. After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon, we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannister’s trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother."
27429,NARRATOR:Members of the crowd murmur to one another.
27430,"TOMMEN: Furthermore, after much prayer and reflection, the Crown has decided that from this day forward, trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms. The tradition is a brutish one, a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods. Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith. Seven blessings to all."
27431,CROWD: Seven blessings.
27432,"NARRATOR:TOMMEN stands and makes his way out of the hall, accompanied by the goldcloaks. CERSEI watches him leave. QYBURN walks up beside CERSEi and whispers to her."
27433,QYBURN: Your Grace...that old rumor you told me about. My little birds investigated.
27434,CERSEI: And? Was it just a rumor or something more?
27435,QYBURN: More. Much more.
27436,MISSANDEI: You seem happy.
27437,"TYRION: I am happy. You should both be as well. Not so long ago, this city was ready to devour itself."
27438,NARRATOR:TYRION puts down his glass of wine on a table and pours another glass of wine.
27439,TYRION: Now it’s like a man reborn.
27440,MISSANDEI: I will be happy when our queen returns.
27441,TYRION: Why don’t you drink? Why don’t either of you ever drink?
27442,NARRATOR:TYRION pours a third glass of wine.
27443,GREY WORM: Unsullied never drink.
27444,TYRION: Why not?
27445,GREY WORM: Rules.
27446,TYRION: And who made these rules? Your former masters?
27447,NARRATOR:GREY WORM and MISSANDEI look at each other.
27448,TYRION: Those miserable old shits didn’t want you to be human. Have a drink with me.
27449,NARRATOR:TYRION hands GREY WORM one of the glasses of wine. GREY WORM takes it.
27450,TYRION (to MISSANDEI): And you? What’s your excuse?
27451,NARRATOR:GREY WORM sniffs his glass of wine and scrunches up his face. TYRION hands MISSANDEI the second glass of wine. She takes it.
27452,MISSANDEI: I have tried wine before. It made me feel funny.
27453,TYRION: That’s how you know it’s working.
27454,NARRATOR:TYRION returns to his glass of wine and raises it up.
27455,TYRION: Here’s to our queen. Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen.
27456,NARRATOR:GREY WORM and MISSANDEI raise their glasses.
27457,"TYRION: To Daenerys Stormborn, Mother of Dragons, Breaker of Chains, long may she reign."
27458,GREY WORM & MISSANDEI: Long may she reign.
27459,NARRATOR:GREY WORM and MISSANDEI sip from their glasses. TYRION drinks all of his.
27460,TYRION: Do you like it?
27461,GREY WORM: Tastes like it has turned.
27462,NARRATOR:TYRION walks to another decanter on the opposite side of the room and pours himself another glass of wine.
27463,"TYRION: Yes, yes. Fermentation. One day, after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms...I’d like to have my own vineyard. Make my own wine. The Imp’s Delight. Only my close friends could drink it."
27464,NARRATOR:TYRION sips his wine.
27465,"TYRION: Tell me a joke, Missandei of Naath."
27466,NARRATOR:TYRION walks back in front of GREY WORM and MISSANDEI.
27467,MISSANDEI: I do not know any jokes.
27468,TYRION: Grey worm?
27469,NARRATOR:GREY WORM stares and says nothing.
27470,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI sips her wine.
27471,"TYRION: ...but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup. The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another. The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole. The Stark reaches into his cup, pulls out the fly and shouts, “Spit it out, you see shit. Spit it out.”"
27472,NARRATOR:GREY WORM and MISSANDEI do not laugh.
27473,TYRION: It’s funnier in Westeros.
27474,"GREY WORM: The Starks and the lannisters, i thought these were enemies."
27475,TYRION: Yes.
27476,"MISSANDEI: A joke is like a story, Torgo Nudho. Not a true story, necessarily."
27477,"TYRION: A story that’s supposed to make you laugh, ideally. Not at the moment, perhaps."
27478,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI sips her wine again.
27479,"TYRION: Missandei, do you like the wine?"
27480,MISSANDEI: I do.
27481,TYRION: Tell a joke.
27482,MISSANDEI: Two translators are on a sinking ship.
27483,NARRATOR:TYRION smiles.
27484,"MISSANDEI: The first says, “Do you know how to swim?” The second says, “No, but I can shout for help in 19 languages.”"
27485,NARRATOR:There is a pause.
27486,NARRATOR:TYRION Ah!
27487,NARRATOR:TYRION begins to laugh. MISSANDEI smiles and sips her wine.
27488,GREY WORM: That is the worst joke I ever heard.
27489,MISSANDEI: You don’t even know what a joke is.
27490,GREY WORM: I am soldier all my life. You think I never hear joke?
27491,TYRION: You lied to us.
27492,GREY WORM: I make joke.
27493,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI and TYRION laugh. GREY WORM smiles.
27494,MISSANDEI: More jokes.
27495,"NARRATOR:Bells begin to ring. GREY WORM stands and runs out of the room, shouting in Valyrian."
27496,NARRATOR:A fleet of white-sailed ships approaches Meereen. TYRION and MISSANDEI stare at at the ships.
27497,MISSANDEI: The Masters have come for their property.
27498,JAIME: Lord Edmure.
27499,"NARRATOR:EDMURE’s hands are behind his back, his wrists bound around a vertical pole in the center of the tent. He is kneeling."
27500,JAIME: I apologize for the way the Freys treated you. A man of your birth deserved better. You have my word you’ll be properly fed and clothes from now on.
27501,NARRATOR:EDMURE stands.
27502,EDMURE: I have your word?
27503,NARRATOR:EDMURE scoffs.
27504,"JAIME: The Blackfish is an old man. A good death is all he can hope for. But you, you have a child now, I’ve heard. A son you sired on your wedding night. You’re a potent man."
27505,EDMURE: A son I’ve never met born of a wife that I haven’t seen since our first night together.
27506,"JAIME: You should be with them both. I can arrange that, you realize? Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock. A tutor for your boy, knights to train him to fight and to ride. And when he comes of age, he’ll have a keep of his own."
27507,EDMURE: Do you imagine yourself a decent person? Is that it? After you’ve massacred my family. Kept me in a cell for years. Stolen our lands.
27508,"JAIME: I’ll remind you that our houses are at war. I’m sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you, but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences."
27509,EDMURE: Says the man who shoved his sword through his king’s back.
27510,JAIME: Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation? It’s not.
27511,NARRATOR:JAIME sits on a barrel in the corner of the room.
27512,EDMURE: You understand. On some level you understand that you’re an evil man.
27513,JAIME: I’ll leave the judgments to the gods.
27514,"EDMURE: Well, that is convenient for you. You’re a fine-looking fellow, aren’t you?"
27515,NARRATOR:EDMURE chuckles.
27516,"EDMURE: Your square jaw, your golden armor. Tell me, I want to know. I truly do. How do you live with yourself? All of us have to believe that we’re decent, don’t we? You have to sleep at night. How do you tell yourself that you’re decent after everything that you’ve done?"
27517,JAIME: I was your sister’s prisoner once. She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.
27518,NARRATOR:EDMURE laughs.
27519,EDMURE: Yeah. She should have killed you.
27520,"JAIME: Perhaps, but she didn’t. Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me. But I didn’t hate her. I admired her. Far more than her husband or her son."
27521,EDMURE: Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you don’t?
27522,"JAIME: No, I don’t, but I’m telling you anyway because you’re my prisoner. You don’t have a choice. The love she had for her children, I was a little awed by it. Reminded me of my sister."
27523,"EDMURE: Oh. Oh, I see. You’re a madman."
27524,EDMURE: Don’t talk about Cat!
27525,JAIME: I’ll talk about whomever I want.
27526,NARRATOR:EDMURE grunts and struggles against his bindings.
27527,"JAIME: She loved her children. I suppose all mothers do, but Catelyn and Cersei, there’s a fierceness you don’t often see."
27528,NARRATOR:JAIME stands and walks closer to EDMURE.
27529,JAIME: They’d do anything to protect their babies.
27530,NARRATOR:JAIME gets in EDMURE’s face.
27531,JAIME: Start a war. Burn cities to ash. Free their worst enemies. The things we do for love.
27532,EDMURE: You didn’t come here to talk about our sisters.
27533,"JAIME: That’s exactly why I came here. I love Cersei. You can laugh at that if you want. You can sneer. It doesn’t matter. She needs me. And to get back to her, I have to take Riverrun. I’ll send for your baby boy."
27534,"NARRATOR:EDMURE struggles against his bindings, pushing himself towards JAIME."
27535,"JAIME: And I’ll launch him into Riverrun with a catapult. Because you don’t matter to me, Lord Edmure. Your son doesn’t matter to me. The people in the castle don’t matter to me. Only Cersei. And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her, that’s what I’ll do."
27536,"NARRATOR:EDMURE crosses the bridge over Riverrun’s moat, carrying a torch. Several guards point crossbows down at him. He stops at the end of the bridge."
27537,GUARD CAPTAIN: Who goes there?
27538,"EDMURE: Edmure Tully, son of Hoster Tully, and the rightful Lord of Riverrun. I demand entry."
27539,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN appears on the wall with the guards.
27540,BRYNDEN: Don’t let him in.
27541,GUARD CAPTAIN: He’s the Lord of Riverrun. I have to obey his commands.
27542,"BRYNDEN: He’s been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding. Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home? Because it’s a trap, you idiot. Don’t let him in."
27543,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN turns to walk away.
27544,"GUARD CAPTAIN: He’s my lord, my lord. I’ve sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands."
27545,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN turns back.
27546,BRYNDEN: You’re not obeying Edmure’s commands. You’re obeying the fucking Kinglsayer’s commands.
27547,EDMURE (O.S.): I demand entry.
27548,GUARD CAPTAIN: My lord has given an order.
27549,BRYNDEN: WIth a knife to his throat. That is not a valid order.
27550,NARRATOR:The guard captain turns to his fellow guards.
27551,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword halfway. The guard captain and the other guards show their steel.
27552,BRYNDEN: I’ll have your head before I surrender Riverrun.
27553,"GUARD CAPTAIN: You are not lord of this castle, my lord."
27554,"NARRATOR:BRYNDEN looks around at the other guards, sheathes his sword, and walks away."

27568,BRYNDEN: Go on.
27569,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN stands and faces him.
27570,BRIENNE: Come with us.
27571,BRYNDEN: I’ve run before from the Red Wedding. I’m not running again. This is my family home.
27572,BRIENNE: Your family is in the North. Come with us. Don’t die for pride when you can fight for your blood.
27573,BRYNDEN: You’ll serve Sansa far better than I ever could.
27574,NARRATOR:Some guards begin shouting in the background.
27575,"BRYNDEN: Go on, now."
27576,NARRATOR:BRYNDEN unsheathes his sword.
27577,BRYNDEN: I haven’t had a proper sword fight in years. I expect I’ll make a damn fool of myself.

27582,JAIME: Good. Bring him to me.
27583,"GUARD: He died fighting, my lord."
27584,NARRATOR:JAIME nods to the guard. The guard exits. JAIME stares out at the river and sees BRIENNE and PODRICK rowing away from Riverrun. He looks around to see if anyone else is watching. BRIENNE looks over her shoulder and sees JAIME standing atop the wall. JAIME waves to her. BRIENNE waves back.
27585,NARRATOR:TYRION and MISSANDEI enter. GREY WORM is waiting for them. Many Unsullied stand guard around the room.
27586,TYRION: I was wrong. I admit it.
27587,MISSANDEI: That changes nothing.
27588,GREY WORM: No more talking from you. Your talking gave us this.
27589,GREY WORM: You’re trying to tell me what the army should do. You do not know what the army should do.
27590,"TYRION: All right, what should the army do?"
27591,"GREY WORM: We’ll not go to the beach. If we go to the beach, the Masters will take the pyramid. The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend. We stay here."
27592,TYRION: And then?
27593,GREY WORM: We wait for them to come to us. Then we fight them.
27594,"NARRATOR:Something thuds and rattles the roof of the pyramid. Footsteps can be heard. Everyone looks up. MISSANDEI grabs a knife from a table and stands beside TYRION. GREY WORM and the Unsullied form up in front of the door to the balcony. One Unsullied opens the door. Another inches out through it, shield and spear in hand. The Unsullied man looks side to side and sees nothing, but then sees something and kneels. The rest of the Unsullied follow suit. DAENERYS enters. A dragon screeches and flies away in the background."
27595,BERIC: Clegane.
27596,THOROS: What the fuck you doing here?
27597,SANDOR: Chasing them. You?
27598,THOROS: Hanging them.
27599,SANDOR: Any particular reason?
27600,BERIC: They’re our men. Or they were. They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers. Why do you want them?
27601,SANDOR: Same reason. I was helping build it. They killed a friend of mine.
27602,THOROS: You’ve got friends?
27603,SANDOR: Not anymore. They’re mine.
27604,NARRATOR:SANDOR advances. BERIC and another member of the Brotherhood block his path.
27605,BERIC: It’s the Brotherhood’s good name they’ve dragged through the dirt.
27606,"SANDOR: Fuck your name. They’re mine. I killed you once before, Dondarrion. Happy to do it again."
27607,NARRATOR:One of the Brotherhood members notches an arrow and points his bow at SANDOR.
27608,"SANDOR: Drop that arrow, you bloody girl."
27609,NARRATOR:SANDOR points his ax at the man but keeps his eyes locked on BERIC.
27610,SANDOR: Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me.
27611,NARRATOR:SANDOR walks towards the bowman.
27612,BERIC: You can have one of them.
27613,"NARRATOR:SANDOR turns back to face BERIC, glances at the men about to be hanged, then looks back at BERIC."
27614,SANDOR: Two.
27615,NARRATOR:BERIC looks at THOROS. THOROS nods. BERIC nods to SANDOR. SANDOR approaches one of the men and raises his ax above his head to swing. THOROS catches the ax’s handle from behind.
27616,"THOROS: No, no, no."
27617,NARRATOR:SANDOR turns to face THOROS and tries to wrench his ax free.
27618,THOROS: We’re not butchers. We hang them.
27619,NARRATOR:THOROS releases SANDOR’s ax.
27620,SANDOR: hanging? All over in an instant. Where’s the punishment in that?
27621,THOROS: They die.
27622,SANDOR: We all bloody die.
27623,NARRATOR:SANDOR gestures to BERIC.
27624,SANDOR: Except this one here. I’ll only gut one of them.
27625,BERIC: No.
27626,SANDOR: I’ll chop off one hand.
27627,BERIC: We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss. That’s generous.
27628,SANDOR: Bunch of nancies.
27629,NARRATOR:SANDOR throws down his ax.
27630,SANDOR: There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three.
27631,"THOROS: You’re getting old, Clegane."
27632,SANDOR: He’s not.
27633,"NARRATOR:SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath one of the men, hanging him. He moves in front of LEM."
27634,LEM: Please don’t. I’ll give you anything.
27635,"NARRATOR:SANDOR kicks the box out from underneath LEM, hanging him. LEM gasps for air. BERIC hangs the third man. SANDOR pulls the boot off of LEM’s foot. BERIC and THOROS begin to walk away, but turn back to look at SANDOR. SANDOR takes off his own boot and sizes up LEM’s boot to his own foot. He shoves his foot into LEM’s boot and looks up at BERIC and THOROS."
27636,SANDOR: Got anything to eat?
27637,"NARRATOR:Several members of the Brotherhood are sitting around small campfires. SANDOR, BERIC, and some other Brothers are sitting at one such campfire. SANDOR is eating a piece of meat. THOROS approaches and sits beside them."
27638,THOROS (to SANDOR): Enjoying yourself?
27639,SANDOR: I prefer chicken.
27640,NARRATOR:THOROS hands SANDOR a water skin. SANDOR drinks from it.
27641,BERIC: You ought to join us. We could use you.
27642,SANDOR: I tried joining. Didn’t work out for me.
27643,"THOROS: Clegane, we’re here for a reason. The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason. He gave a failed, drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason. We are part of something larger than ourselves."
27644,SANDOR: Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves.
27645,"NARRATOR:SANDOR returns the water skin to THOROS, stands, walks to the river, and urinates into it."
27646,BERIC: Cold winds are rising in the North.
27647,SANDOR: And you’re going to go stop them?
27648,BERIC: We need good men to help us.
27649,"SANDOR: Last time you saw me, you wanted to execute me."
27650,BERIC: True enough. But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me. Why?
27651,NARRATOR:SANDOR laughs.
27652,"SANDOR: I beat you because I’m better than you, Beric. I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and I’m better than you now."
27653,NARRATOR:SANDOR returns to his spot by the campfire and sits.
27654,"BERIC: Aye, you’re probably right. You’re a fighter. You were born a fighter. You walked away from the fight. How did that go? Good and bad, young and old, the things we’re fighting will destroy them all alike. You can still help a lot more than you’ve harmed Clegane, it’s not too late for you."
27655,ARYA: Lady Crane?
27656,NARRATOR:ARYA gets out of bed and winces. She walks towards the abutting room.
27657,ARYA: Lady Crane?
27658,"NARRATOR:ARYA enters the abutting room and sees LADY CRANE lying crumpled on top of the stool, dead. Blood is pooled on the ground beneath her."
27659,"WAIF: If you’d have done your job, she would have died painlessly."
27660,"NARRATOR:ARYA turns to see the WAIF standing in the doorway with a knife. The WAIF approaches ARYA slowly and ARYA backs away, matching her pace."
27661,WAIF: Instead…
27662,NARRATOR:The WAIF holds out her arms.
27663,WAIF: The Many-Faced God was promised a name. He must always receive what is his. You can’t change that. I can’t change that. No one can. And now he’s been promised another name.
27664,"NARRATOR:ARYA turns around, runs out onto the balcony, and jumps off. She grunts as her hands and feet connect with the ground. The sprints off through the streets, pushing people out of the way. The WAIF emerges from the door to LADY CRANE’s apartment, spies ARYA, and chases after her. ARYA runs through an alleyway. A man pushes a cart in her way. She slides underneath it and continues running. The WAIF jumps clean over the cart. ARYA turns a corner and runs down a set of stairs. A woman dumps a barrel of water on the ground outside the door to a room at the bottom of the steps. ARYA sees her and darts into the room. The WAIF turns the corner to the steps but stops when she does not see ARYA. The room ARYA has entered is a sauna. She moves through it. A number of men in towels are relaxing in the heat. ARYA emerges from the door on the opposite side of the sauna and looks around. She enters the crowd, walking through it. The WAIF appears on a high wall behind her, then jumps down into the crowd. ARYA turns back to see her and runs away. The WAIF pursues her. ARYA reaches the end of the marketplace and jumps off a high wall. She lands on a large set of steps where many fruit merchants have laid their baskets. She tumbles down the steps, knocking over the baskets as she goes and grunting with pain. The crowd clamors. ARYA comes to a stop at the bottom of the steps. She puts her hand to her stomach. Her hand comes away bloody. The WAIF appears at the top of the steps. ARYA sees her, stands, and throws herself over a small wall into an alleyway. The WAIF follows her. ARYA whimpers as she moves through the alleyway. She leaves blood stains on everything she touches. She enters a small, dark room, lit by a single candle. The WAIF follows her inside, knife in hand. ARYA kneels in the small living space she has made for herself. The WAIF enters and shuts the door behind her."
27665,WAIF: It will all be over soon. On your knees or on your feet?
27666,NARRATOR:ARYA retrieves Needle from beneath a blanket and stands.
27667,WAIF: Haven’t we been through this already? That won’t help you.
27668,"NARRATOR:The WAIF advances. ARYA holds Needle up in front of her face, closes her eyes, and cuts the candle in half. The room goes dark."
27669,NARRATOR:JAQEN enters the main hall. He notices a blood trail on the floor leading to the Hall of Faces. He follows the trail and enters the Hall. The trail leads to one of the columns bearing the faces. The WAIF’s bloody face rests in one of the sconces.
27670,ARYA: You told her to kill me.
27671,"NARRATOR:ARYA appears behind JAQEN, pointing Needle at him. JAQEN turns to face her."
27672,JAQEN: Yes. But here you are. And there she is.
27673,NARRATOR:JAQEN pushes his chest against Needle’s point.
27674,JAQEN: Finally a girl is no one.
27675,ARYA: A girl is Arya Stark of Winterfell and I’m going home.
27676,NARRATOR:JAQEN smiles. ARYA turns and exits.
27677,NARRATOR:CREDITS
27678,"TYRION: Despite appearances, I think you’ll find the city’s on the rise."
27679,NARRATOR:An explosion occurs outside.
27680,TYRION: Perhaps we should take shelter.
27681,NARRATOR:An explosion occurs outside.
27682,DAENERYS: The city is on the rise?
27683,TYRION: Meereen is strong. Commerce has returned to the markets. The people are behind you.
27684,NARRATOR:An explosion occurs outside.
27685,"TYRION: Well, not all the people, of course. No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people. But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence. The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed. Because if Meereen succeeds, a city without slavery, a city without Masters…"
27686,NARRATOR:An explosion occurs outside.
27687,TYRION: ...it proves that no one needs a Master.
27688,DAENERYS: Good. Shall we begin?
27689,TYRION: Do we have a plan?
27690,"DAENERYS: I will crucify the Masters. I will set their fleets afire, kill every last one of their soldiers, and return their cities to the dirt. That is my plan."
27691,NARRATOR:TYRION tightens his jaw and looks away.
27692,DAENERYS: You don’t approve?
27693,TYRION: You once told me you knew what your father was. Did you know his plans for King’s Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates?
27694,NARRATOR:An explosion occurs outside.
27695,"TYRION: Probably not. Well, he told my brother and Jaime told me. He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep, the Guildhalls, the Sept of Baelor, all the major thoroughfares. He would have burned every one of his citizens. The loyal ones and the trators. Every man, woman, and child. That’s why Jaime killed him."
27696,DAENERYS: This is entirely different.
27697,TYRION: You’re talking about destroying cities. It’s not entirely different. I’d like to suggest an alternate approach.
27698,"NARRATOR:A blast causes the window across the room to explode inward, sending shards of wood flying everywhere. DAENERYS and TYRION duck, then turn to look at the window."
27699,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS, TYRION, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and an assembly of Unsullied stand across from the three Masters, YEZZAN ZO QAGGAZ, RAZDAL MO ERAZ, and BELICHO PAENYMION, and a group of their soldiers."
27700,"RAZDAL (to DAENERYS): Once before, I offered you peace. If you had not been so arrogant, you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships. Instead, you will flee Slaver’s Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are."
27701,"TYRION: We are here to discuss terms of surrender, not to trade insults."
27702,YEZZAN: The terms are simple. You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen. The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder. The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered.
27703,"DAENERYS: We obviously didn’t communicate clearly. We’re here to discuss your surrender, not mine."
27704,RAZDAL: I imagine it’s difficult adjust to the new reality. Your reign is over.
27705,DAENERYS: My reign has just begun.
27706,"NARRATOR:A dragon screeches in the distance. YEZZAN turns to look in the direction of the screech. DROGON flies up over the plateau and lands on an overlooking structure. He roars and drops down beside DAENERYS. DAENERYS climbs on his back and they fly off over Meereen. When they pass over the entrance to the catacombs, RHAEGAL and VISERION bust down the door with flame and take flight to join them. The ensemble flies over the beach entrance to Meereen."
27707,"NARRATOR:A group of the Sons of the Harpy are slaughtering citizens of Meereen. Galloping footsteps can be heard in the distance. One of the Sons of the Harpy turns to look in the direction of the sound. The Dothraki horde led by DAARIO rounds the bend of a nearby cliff, yelling war cries and charging full force towards the Sons of the Harpy on horseback. DAARIO beheads a Son of the Harpy."
27708,NARRATOR:DAENERYS and the dragons fly over the Masters’ ships. The soldiers on the ships stop what they’re doing and stare up at the dragons. DAENERYS and DROGON come to a halt and hover in front of one of the ships.
27709,DAENERYS: Dracarys.
27710,NARRATOR:The dragons shoot stream of fire down at the the ship. The ship becomes engulfed in flame and the soldiers scream as they die. The ship incinerates and capsizes.
27711,NARRATOR:GREY WORM steps forward and addresses the Masters’ soldiers.
27712,GREY WORM (speaking Valyrian): You men have a choice:
27713,NARRATOR:The Unsullied ready their spears. The Masters’ soldiers ready their swords.
27714,"GREY WORM: ...fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you, or go home to your families."
27715,NARRATOR:A dragon screeches in the distance. The Masters’ soldiers lay down their arms and run away.
27716,"TYRION: Thank you for the armada. Our queen does love ships. Now, last time we spoke, we made a pact. You violated that pact. You declared war upon us. Though our queen does have a forgiving nature, this cannot be forgiven."
27717,MISSANDEI: Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes.
27718,"TYRION: It always seems a bit abstract, doesn’t it, other people dying?"
27719,NARRATOR:RAZDAL grabs YEZZAN.
27720,RAZDAL: Him. He should die.
27721,"BELICHO: Yes, him."
27722,NARRATOR:TYRION looks at GREY WORM.
27723,"RAZDAL: He’s not one of us. He’s an outsider, a lowborn. He does not speak for us."
27724,NARRATOR:GREY WORM approaches the YEZZAN and stares in his eyes.
27725,YEZZAN: Please.
27726,NARRATOR:YEZZAN falls to his knees. GREY WORM unsheathes his dagger and slices RAZDAL and BELICHO’s throats. He sheathes his dagger and steps back. TYRION approaches YEZZAN and puts his hand on his shoulder.
27727,"TYRION: Tell your people what happened here. Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty. When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory, remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen."
27728,"NARRATOR:TYRION pats YEZZAN on the shoulder. He, GREY WORM, and MISSANDEI walk away."
27729,JON SNOW: You don’t have to be here.
27730,"SANSA: Yes, I do."
27731,RAMSAY: My beloved wife. I’ve missed you terribly.
27732,NARRATOR:RAMSAY looks at JON SNOW.
27733,"RAMSAY: Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely. Now, dismount and kneel before me, surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North. I will pardon you for deserting the Night’s Watch. I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house. Come, bastard, you don’t have the men, you don’t have the horses, and you don’t have Winterfell. Why lead those pour souls into slaughter? There’s no need for a battle. Get off your hose and kneel. I’m a man of mercy."
27734,JON SNOW: You’re right. There’s no need for a battle. Thousands of men don’t need to die. Only one of us. Let’s end this the old way. You against me.
27735,NARRATOR:RAMSAY chuckles.
27736,"RAMSAY: I keep hearing stories about you, bastard. The way people in the North talk about you, you’re the greatest swordsman who ever walked. Maybe you are that good. Maybe not. I don’t know if I’d beat you. But I know that my army will beat yours. I have 6,000 men. You have, what, half that? Not even?"
27737,"JON SNOW: Aye, you have the numbers. Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldn’t fight for them?"
27738,NARRATOR:RAMSAY points at JON SNOW.
27739,"RAMSAY: He’s good. Very good. Tell me, will you let your little brother die because you’re too proud to surrender?"
27740,SANSA: How do we know you have him?
27741,NARRATOR:RAMSAY nods to SMALLJON. SMALLJON pulls SHAGGYDOG’s head out from a satchel and throws it on the ground.
27742,"RAMSAY: Now, if you want to save —"
27743,"SANSA: You’re going to die tomorrow, Lord Bolton. Sleep well."
27744,NARRATOR:SANSA turns her horse and rides away.
27745,"RAMSAY (to JON SNOW): She’s a fine woman, your sister. I look forward to having her back in my bed. And you’re all fine-looking men. My dogs are desperate to meet you. I haven’t fed them for seven days. They’re ravenous. I wonder which parts they’ll try first. Your eyes? Your balls? We’ll find out soon enough. In the morning, then, bastard."
27746,NARRATOR:RAMSAY and company ride back towards Winterfell. JON SNOW looks down.
27747,"NARRATOR:JON SNOW, DAVOS, TORMUND, and SANSA are standing around a planning table."
27748,"JON SNOW: If he was smart, he’d stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out."
27749,"DAVOS: That’s not his way. He knows the North is watching. If the other houses sense weakness on his part, they’ll stop fearing him. He can’t have that. Fear is his power."
27750,"JON SNOW: It’s his weakness, too. His mean don’t want to fight for him. They’re forced to fight for him. If they feel the tide turning..."
27751,TORMUND: It’s not his men that worry me. It’s his horses. I know what mounted knights can do to us.
27752,NARRATOR:TORMUND looks at DAVOS.
27753,TORMUND: You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow.
27754,"JON SNOW: We’re digging trenches all along our flanks. They won’t be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you, in a double envelopment."
27755,NARRATOR:TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW.
27756,JON SNOW: A pincer move.
27757,NARRATOR:TORMUND stares blankly at JON SNOW. JON SNOW and DAVOS look at each other briefly.
27758,JON SNOW: They won’t be able to hit us from the sides.
27759,TORMUND: Good.
27760,"DAVOS: It’s crucial that we let them charge at us. They’ve got the numbers, we need the patience. If we let him buckle our center, he’ll pursue. Then we’ll have him surrounded on three sides."
27761,TORMUND (to JON SNOW): Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man?
27762,JON SNOW: No. But I wanted to make him angry. I want him coming at us full tilt.
27763,DAVOS: We should all get some sleep.
27764,"TORMUND: Rest, Jon Snow. We need you sharp tomorrow."
27765,"NARRATOR:DAVOS, TORMUND, and any remaining attendants exit. JON SNOW sits down at the head of the table."
27766,"SANSA: So you’ve met the enemy, drawn up your battle plans."
27767,"JON SNOW: Aye, for what they’re worth."
27768,"SANSA: You’ve known him for the space of a single conversation, you and your trusted advisors, and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you don’t know. I lived with him. I know the way his mind works. I know how he likes to hurt people. Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight?"
27769,JON SNOW: You’re right.
27770,SANSA: You think he’s going to fall into your trap. He won’t He’s the one who lays traps.
27771,JON SNOW: He’s overconfident.
27772,SANSA: He plays with people. He’s far better at it than you. He’s been doing it all his life.
27773,NARRATOR:JON SNOW stands.
27774,"JON SNOW: Aye, and what have I been doing all my life? Playing with broomsticks? I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton. I’ve defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton."
27775,SANSA: You don’t know him.
27776,"JON SNOW: All right, tell me. What should we do? How do we get Rickon back?"
27777,"SANSA: We’ll never get him back. Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son, which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you, a bastard, or me, a girl. As long as he lives, Ramsay’s claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won’t live long."
27778,JON SNOW: We can’t give up on our brother.
27779,"SANSA: Listen to me, please. He wants you to make a mistake."
27780,JON SNOW: Of course he does. What should I do differently?
27781,SANSA: I don’t know! I don’t know anything about battles! Just don’t do what he wants you to do.
27782,"JON SNOW: Aye, that’s good advice."
27783,SANSA: You think that’s obvious?
27784,"JON SNOW: Well, it is a bit obvious."
27785,"SANSA: If you had asked for my advice earlier, I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force, or is that obvious, too?"
27786,JON SNOW: When will we have a larger force?! We’ve pleaded with every house that’ll have us! The Blackfish can’t help us! We’re lucky to have this many men!
27787,SANSA: It’s not enough!
27788,"JON SNOW: Now, it’s not enough! It’s what we have! Battles have been won against greater odds."
27789,"SANSA: If Ramsay wins, I’m not going back there alive. Do you understand me?"
27790,"NARRATOR:JON SNOW I won’t ever let him touch you again. I’ll protect you, I promise."
27791,SANSA: No one can protect me. No one can protect anyone.
27792,"NARRATOR:SANSA exits. JON SNOW turns, looks at the table, and sighs."
27793,CUT TO: STARK ENCAMPMENT
27794,NARRATOR:DAVOS and TORMUND are walking together through the encampment.
27795,DAVOS: You think there’s hope?
27796,"TORMUND: I’ve never seen these Bolton fuckers fight. And they’ve never seen the free folk fight, so, yes, there’s hope. You want to avenge your king, don’t you?"
27797,DAVOS: It wasn’t the Boltons defeated Stannis. It was Stannis himself. I loved the man. He lifted me up and made me something. But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things.
27798,TORMUND: You saw these demons?
27799,DAVOS: What?
27800,NARRATOR:They stop walking. DAVOS looks at TORMUND.
27801,"DAVOS: No, it’s a manner of speaking. Not actual demons."
27802,"TORMUND: Oh. Well, you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned. Mance didn’t have demons in his skull. He didn’t torch people or listen to some red witch. I believed in him. I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night. But I was wrong just like you."
27803,"DAVOS: Maybe that was our mistake, believing in kings."
27804,TORMUND: Jon Snow’s not a king.
27805,"DAVOS: No, he’s not."
27806,NARRATOR:TORMUND and DAVOS smile at each other.
27807,TORMUND: I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight. You want some? I have a jug of sour goat’s milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on.
27808,"DAVOS: No, thanks. It does sound delicious, but I better keep a clear head. I can never sleep the night before a battle."
27809,TORMUND: So what do you do all night?
27810,DAVOS: I walk. Think and walk. Think and walk until I’m far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out.
27811,NARRATOR:TORMUND laughs.
27812,TORMUND: Happy shitting.
27813,NARRATOR:TORMUND walks away.
27814,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE is sitting at a desk with a mirror and candles on it, staring into a fire pit. JON SNOW enters and approaches her."
27815,JON SNOW: My lady. You weren’t at the war council.
27816,MELISANDRE: I’m not a soldier.
27817,JON SNOW: Any advice?
27818,MELISANDRE: Don’t lose.
27819,"JON SNOW: If I do, if I fall, don’t bring me back."
27820,MELISANDRE: I’ll have to try.
27821,JON SNOW: I’m ordering you not to bring me back.
27822,"MELISANDRE: I am not your servant, Jon Snow."
27823,JON SNOW: You’re in my camp. I’m the commander.
27824,MELISANDRE: I serve the Lord of Light. I do what he commands.
27825,JON SNOW: How do you know what he commands?
27826,"MELISANDRE: I interpret his signs as well as I can. If the Lord didn’t want me to bring you back, how did I bring you back? I have no power. Only what he gives me and he gave me you."
27827,JON SNOW: Why?
27828,MELISANDRE: I don’t know. Maybe you’re only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else. Maybe he brought you here to die again.
27829,JON SNOW: What kind of god would do something like that?
27830,MELISANDRE: The one we’ve got.
27831,NARRATOR:JON SNOW stares into the fire pit and then exits.
27832,"NARRATOR:DAVOS is walking alone through the snow. He happens upon a pile of wooden rubble and stops to inspect it. He sees a charred statuette of a stag in the wood and stops to pick it up. He looks back at the pile of wood. A horn blows in the distance. DAVOS looks in the direction of the horn, then hands his head."
27833,"TYRION (to THEON): Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell, yes? You were making jokes about my height, I seem to recall. Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarf’s height thinks he’s the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarf’s height. “The height of nobility,” “a man of your stature,” “someone to look up to.” You’re all making the same five or six jokes."
27834,THEON: It was a long time ago.
27835,"TYRION: It was. And how have things been going for you since then? Not so well, I gather. Can’t imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well."
27836,THEON: I didn’t murder the Stark boys. But I did things that were just as bad or worse.
27837,YARA: And he paid for them.
27838,"TYRION: Doesn’t seem like it. He’s still alive. It was complicated for you, I’m sure, growing up at Winterfell. Never quite knowing who you were. But then, we all live complicated lives, don’t we?"
27839,"DAENERYS: You’ve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them. In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?"
27840,THEON: Not my claim. Hers.
27841,DAENERYS: And what’s wrong with you?
27842,THEON: I’m not fit to rule.
27843,TYRION: We can agree upon that at least.
27844,DAENERYS: Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?
27845,YARA: No more than Westeros.
27846,NARRATOR:DAENERYS smiles.
27847,THEON: Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence. He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara. He would have murdered us if we had stayed.
27848,DAENERYS: Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king.
27849,YARA: You and I have that in common.
27850,DAENERYS: We do. And both murdered by a usurper as well.
27851,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to TYRION.
27852,DAENERYS: Will their ships be enough?
27853,"TYRION: With the former Masters’ fleet, possibly. Barely. There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet."
27854,THEON: There are and Euron is building more. He’s going to offer them to you.
27855,DAENERYS: So why shouldn’t I wait for him?
27856,THEON: The Iron Fleet isn’t all he’s bringing. He also wants to give you --
27857,"YARA: His big cock, I think he said. Euron’s offer is also an offer of marriage, you see. You won’t get one without the other."
27858,DAENERYS: And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands?
27859,"YARA: I never demand, but I’m up for anything, really."
27860,THEON: He murdered our father and would have murdered us. He’ll murder you as soon as you have what he wants.
27861,TYRION: The Seven Kingdoms.
27862,THEON: All of them.
27863,DAENERYS: And you don’t want the Seven Kingdoms?
27864,THEON: Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands. We ask you to give them back.
27865,DAENERYS: And that’s all?
27866,YARA: We’d like you to help us murder an uncle or two who don’t think a woman’s fit to rule.
27867,DAENERYS: Reasonable.
27868,TYRION: What if everyone starts demanding their independence?
27869,"DAENERYS: She’s not demanding, she’s asking. The others are free to ask as well. Our father were evil men, all of us here. They left the world worse than they found it. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to leave the world better than we found it."
27870,NARRATOR:DAENERYS stands and approaches YARA.
27871,"DAENERYS: You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms. No more reaving, roving, raiding, or raping."
27872,YARA: That’s our way of life.
27873,DAENERYS: No more.
27874,NARRATOR:YARA and THEON look at each other. THEON nods. YARA turns back to DAENERYS.
27875,YARA: No more.
27876,NARRATOR:YARA extends her hand to DAENERYS. DAENERYS looks back at TYRION. TYRION makes a shaking motion with his hand. DAENERYS and YARA grab each other’s arms.
27877,"RAMSAY: Do you like games, little man? Let’s play a game. Run to your brother. The sooner you make it to him, the sooner you get to see him. That’s it. That’s the game. Easy. Ready? Go."
27878,"NARRATOR:RICKON starts walking out into the field, then looks back at RAMSAY."
27879,"RAMSAY: No, you have to run, remember? Those are the rules."
27880,NARRATOR:A soldier approaches and hands RAMSAY his bow. RICKON starts running across the field. RAMSAY draws an arrow from his quiver. JON SNOW jumps on his horse and begins galloping across the field towards RICKON. RAMSAY notches an arrow and fires. The arrow lands in the ground next to RICKON. RAMSAY fires another arrow. It lands on the ground next to RICKON. JON SNOW and RICKON are getting closer. JON SNOW extends his hand out to RICKON. RAMSAY shoots another arrow. It misses. JON SNOW and RICKON are feet away from each other. An arrow pierces through RICKON’s chest from behind. RICKON falls to the ground. JON comes to a halt beside him and looks down at him. RICKON gasps and then dies. JON SNOW looks up at RAMSAY.
27881,TORMUND (to himself): Don’t.
27882,NARRATOR:RAMSAY smiles and gives his bow back to the soldier.
27883,DAVOS: Prepare to charge! Prepare to charge!
27884,NARRATOR:The Bolton archers draw and loose a volley of arrows. JON SNOW ushers his horse into a gallop straight towards the Bolton army.
27885,DAVOS: Go! Go! Follow your commander!
27886,TORMUND: Run and fight!
27887,"NARRATOR:WUN WUN roars. The bulk of the Stark forces charge across the field towards the Boltons. JON SNOW continues to rush the Bolton forces alone. The Bolton arches released a volley of arrows, some of which land in the body of JON SNOW’s horse, causing him and his horse to tumble to the ground."
27888,RAMSAY: Now.
27889,"KARSTARK: Cavalry, charge!"
27890,"NARRATOR:JON SNOW stands to face the Bolton cavalry, charging at him. He takes off his sword belt and draws his sword. The cavalry approaches. Just before it’s upon him, the Stark forces rush past JON SNOW and collide with the Bolton charge. Men on both sides die in the frenzy. Bodies and weaponry fly everywhere. Archers on both sides of the battlefield nock arrows and draw their bows."
27891,DAVOS: We’ll just kill our own men. Stand down.
27892,NARRATOR:The Stark arches do not fire.
27893,RAMSAY: Loose!
27894,"NARRATOR:The Bolton archers fire. Their arrows rain down on Stark and Bolton men alike. In the fray, JON SNOW dodges several horses which gallop past him. One Bolton cavalryman charges with his horse, but JON SNOW cuts him down. JON SNOW rushes forward and kills a man on the ground, then slices the belly of a second man. A volley of arrows rains down around JON SNOW. He ducks. None of the arrows hit him. He returns to his feet and cuts down another man, dodges the strike of a passing Bolton cavalryman, and runs through another Bolton footsoldier. A Stark footsoldier helps him finish the Bolton man, and JON SNOW grabs him by the shirt."
27895,JON SNOW: Get word --
27896,"NARRATOR:The Stark footsoldier is taken in the head by an arrow. JON SNOW stares down at the man and then flies into a rage, killing two more Bolton soldiers. A third man runs at him but is knocked down by a galloping horse. JON SNOW runs over to where he landed and stabs him several times. A horseman gallops at JON SNOW with his ax ready, but a passing Stark cavalryman spears him. Another Bolton footsoldier approaches JON SNOW, but JON SNOW cuts him down. The bodies are beginning to pile up on the battlefield. RAMSAY’s archers loose several more volleys. JON SNOW goes into a frenzy, killing many Bolton men. The bodies have piled up high enough to create small mountains of bodies. Men continue to fight atop and around them."
27897,DAVOS: We may as well be taking shits back here.
27898,NARRATOR:DAVOS dismounts his horse.
27899,DAVOS: Follow!
27900,"NARRATOR:DAVOS unsheathes his sword and charges across the field. The remainder of the Stark forces charge after him. On the other side of the battlefield, RAMSAY smiles and acknowledges SMALLJON."
27901,"RAMSAY: It’s time, go."
27902,NARRATOR:SMALLJON brandishes his sword and walks back and forth in front of his men.
27903,SMALLJON: Who owns the North?
27904,ALL: We do!
27905,SMALLJON: Who owns the North?
27906,ALL: We do!
27907,SMALLJON: Show me!
27908,"NARRATOR:SMALLJON and his men cheer and charge across the battlefield. JON SNOW continues fighting, but is knocked to the ground by a Bolton footsoldier. TORMUND appears and stabs the footsoldier through the back, then helps JON SNOW to his feet."
27909,TORMUND: Hey!
27910,"NARRATOR:WUN WUN and the Wildlings charge up behind TORMUND and JON SNOW. SMALLJON and his men are charging from the other side. WUN WUN points at them and grunts. A force of Bolton men appear bearing tall shields and spears. They create a half-circle around JON SNOW, TORMUND, DAVOS, WUN WUN, and the entire Stark forces. The other half of the circle is blocked by the piles of bodies on the battlefield. The shield soldiers set their shields firmly in the dirt, then point their spears inward towards the Stark forces."
27911,"MAN: Infantry, advance!"
27912,"NARRATOR:The shield soldiers grunt in unison, lift their shields, and move in towards the Stark forces. With each wave of movement, they stab more and more Stark soldiers with their spears. One Stark soldier tries to climb up over the piles of bodies but gets cut down by SMALLJON. SMALLJON and his men charge down over the bodies, taking the Stark forces from the rear."
27913,"DAVOS: With me, lads! Break their line!"
27914,"NARRATOR:WUN WUN rushes the shield wall and swipes at the spears. TORMUND jumps to the side of some spears and attacks a man behind the shield wall. Several other Stark men rush towards the shield wall. JON SNOW and other Stark soldiers defend against SMALLJON’s men. Many soldiers die on both sides, and the bodies begin to pile up again. WUN WUN rips a man in half. TORMUND pulls a shieldbearer down and kills him, but gets sliced across the arm and is fored to fall back among the Stark ranks."
27915,MAN: Tormund!
27916,MAN #2: Get him back!
27917,"NARRATOR:The shieldbearers advance, pushing the Stark forces further in on themselves. More Stark men die."
27918,"TORMUND: Fuck this, come on!"

In the fray, JON SNOW is pushes to the bottom of several bodies and starts getting crushed. He struggles to get out, but can’t get a hold. TORMUND faces off against SMALLJON. TORMUND punches SMALLJON in the face, and SMALLJON responds with an overhead swing of his sword. TORMUND blocks it. More and more bodies are piling on top of JON SNOW. He can see glimpses of clashes and flailing limbs above, but nothing else. He gasps for air. SMALLJON knocks TORMUND to the ground and punches him in the face multiple times. Men are dying all around JON SNOW as he is being trampled. JON SNOW grabs onto the clothes of a standing men and hoists himself up. He emerges in the center of a tightly packed group of his men and fills his lungs with air. He spots WUN WUN fighting off some shieldbearers. WUN WUN is stabbed in the side, grunts, and pulls the spear out. SMALLJON repeatedly headbutts TORMUND in the face. DAVOS and JON SNOW look at each other. A horn begins to sound in the distance. SMALLJON stops headbutting TORMUND. TORMUND seizes the opportunity and tears into the skin of SMALLJON’s neck with his teeth, then draws a small knife and stabs SMALLJON repeatedly. RAMSAY looks in the direction of the sounding horn. A force of cavalry appears across the battlefield carrying flags bearing the white falcon sigil of House Arryn. SANSA and PETYR BAELISH sit on horseback beside the charging Arryn cavalry. TORMUND kills SMALLJON and screams.

27921,RAMSAY: Their army’s gone.
27922,MAN: Our army’s gone.
27923,RAMSAY: We have Winterfell. They don’t have the men for a siege. All we have to do is wait.
27924,"NARRATOR:Something thuds against the gate. RAMSAY turns to look at it. Several Bolton archers nock arrows. Several more thuds occur against the other side of the gate. WUN WUN busts a hole in the gate. BOLTON archers shoot arrows at his hand and down at his body over the side of the castle wall. WUN WUN roars and punches another hole in the gate.

TORMUND runs up beside WUN WUN, on his other side. JON SNOW reaches out to WUN WUN, but RAMSAY shoots WUN WUN in the eye with an arrow, killing him."
27925,"RAMSAY (to JON SNOW): You suggested one on one combat, didn’t you?"
27926,NARRATOR:Stark archers aim their bows at RAMSAY.

27935,"RAMSAY: Ah. Sansa. Hello, Sansa. Is this where I’ll be staying now? No. Our time together is about to come to an end. That’s all right. You can’t kill me. I’m part of you now."
27936,SANSA: Your words will disappear. Your house will disappear. Your name will disappear. All memory of you will disappear.
27937,NARRATOR:The dogs growl in their cells and begin filtering out into the kennel.
27938,RAMSAY: My hounds will never harm me.

27946,"WALDER FREY: You're wonder why I brought you all here. After all, we just had a feast. Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight?"
27947,NARRATOR:The Freys laugh.

27957,NARRATOR:WALDER addresses the hall again.
27958,"WALDER: Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man. I'll admit it. But I'm proud of you lot. You're my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding."
27959,NARRATOR:The Freys cheer.
27960,"WALDER: Yes, yes. Cheer. Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home. But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks."
27961,NARRATOR:Some of the Freys groan.
27962,"WALDER: No, no, that was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem."

27978,"JON: I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass. Dragonglass kills white walkers. It's more valuable to us now than gold. We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it. Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow."
27979,ROBETT: It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.
27980,NARRATOR:The northern lords laugh.

27986,NARRATOR:LYANNA stands.
27987,"LYANNA: I don't plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me. I might be small, Lord Glover, and I might be a girl, but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you."
27988,"ROBETT: Indeed you are, my lady. No one has questioned--"
27989,LYANNA: And I don't need your permission to defend the North.
27990,NARRATOR:DAVOS smiles. LYANNA turns to JON.
27991,"LYANNA: We'll begin training every man, woman, boy, and girl on Bear Island."
27992,NARRATOR:The men pound their tables and shout in agreement. ROBETT nods at LYANNA. ROBETT and LYANNA sit.
27993,"JON: While we're preparing for attack, we need to shore up our defenses. The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasn't been properly manned in centuries. I'm not the king of the Free Folk."
27994,NARRATOR:JON looks at TORMUND. TORMUND turns and looks at JON.
27995,JON: But if we're going to survive this winter together...
27996,NARRATOR:TORMUND grunts and stands.
27997,TORMUND: You want us to man the castles for you?
27998,NARRATOR:The men murmur.
27999,JON: Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome. The closest castle to Hardhome is Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.
28000,TORMUND: Then that's where I'll go. Looks like we're the Night's Watch now.
28001,NARRATOR:TORMUND sits.
28002,"JON: If they breach the wall, the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold."
28003,NARRATOR:YOHN stands.
28004,YOHN: The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North. Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing.
28005,"SANSA: The castles committed no crimes. And we need every fortress we have for the war to come. We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families, loyal families who supported us against Ramsay."
28006,ALL: Aye!
28007,NARRATOR:YOHN sits.
28008,JON: The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries. They've kept faith for generation after generation.
28009,SANSA: And then they broke faith.
28010,JON: I'm not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons.
28011,SANSA: So there's no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty?
28012,NARRATOR:The hall goes silent.
28013,JON: The punishment for treason is death. Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle. Harald Karstark died on the field of battle.
28014,SANSA: They died fighting for Ramsay. Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you.
28015,NARRATOR:The men chatter and pound the tables.
28016,"JON: When I was Lord Commander of the Night's Watch I executed men who betrayed me. I executed men who refused to follow orders. My father always said, ""The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword,"" and I have tried to live by those words. But I will not punish a son for his father's sins, and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries. That is my decision, and my decision is final."
28017,NARRATOR:JON stares at SANSA. SANSA looks away. JON addresses the hall.
28018,JON: Ned Umber.
28019,"NARRATOR:NED UMBER, a boy, stands."
28020,JON: Alys Karstark.
28021,"NARRATOR:ALYS KARSTARK, a young woman, stands. NED and ALYS approach the high table."
28022,"JON: For centuries, our families fought side by side on the battlefield. I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark, to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon."
28023,NARRATOR:NED and ALYS unsheathe their swords and kneel.
28024,JON: Stand.
28025,NARRATOR:NED and ALYS stand.
28026,"JON: Yesterday's wars don't matter anymore. The North needs to band together, all the living north. Will you stand beside me, Ned and Alys, now and always?"
28027,NED & ALYS: Now and always!
28028,NARRATOR:The men cheer and pound the tables.
28029,NARRATOR:JON walks briskly along the walkway. SANSA follows him.
28030,"JON: You are my sister, but I am king now."
28031,SANSA: Will you start wearing a crown?
28032,"JON: When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies, you undermine me."
28033,SANSA: So I can't question your decisions anymore?
28034,"JON: Of course you can, but--"
28035,SANSA: Joffrey never let anyone question his authority. You think he was a good king?
28036,"NARRATOR:JON stops walking. SANSA walks past him, then stops and turns to face him."
28037,JON: Do you think I'm Joffrey?
28038,SANSA: You're as far from Joffrey as anyone I've ever met.
28039,JON: Thank you.
28040,NARRATOR:JON stares out at the yard below.
28041,"SANSA: You're good at this, you know."
28042,JON: At what?
28043,SANSA: At ruling.
28044,NARRATOR:JON sighs.
28045,JON: No.
28046,"SANSA: You are. You are. They respect you, they really do, but you have to--"
28047,NARRATOR:JON chuckles.
28048,SANSA: Why are you laughing?
28049,NARRATOR:JON continues walking. SANSA follows.
28050,"JON: What did father used to say? Everything before the word ""but"" is horse shit."
28051,SANSA: He never said that to me.
28052,"JON: No. No, he never cursed in front of his girls."
28053,"SANSA: Because he was trying to protect us. He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is, but Father couldn't protect me and neither can you. Stop trying."
28054,"JON: All right, I'll stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me."
28055,SANSA: I'm not trying to undermine you.
28056,NARRATOR:SANSA grabs JON's arm and spins him to face her.
28057,"SANSA: You have to be smarter than Father. You need to be smarter than Robb. I loved them, I miss them, but they made stupid mistakes, and they both lost their heads for it."
28058,JON: And how should I be smarter? By listening to you?
28059,SANSA: Would that be so terrible?
28060,NARRATOR:MAESTER WOLKAN approaches.
28061,"WOLKAN: A raven from King's Landing, Your Grace."
28062,"NARRATOR:WOLKAN hands a bound note to JON, then bows and leaves. JON unravels the note."
28063,"JON: ""Cersei of House Lannister, First of Her Name, Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms--"""
28064,SANSA: What does she want?
28065,JON: Come to King's Landing. Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors.
28066,"SANSA: You've been so consumed with the enemy to the north, you've forgotten about the one to the south."
28067,"JON: I'm consumed with the Night King because I've seen him. And believe me, you'd think of little else if you had, too."
28068,SANSA: We still have a wall between us and the Night King. Theres nothing between us and Cersei.
28069,JON: There's a thousand miles between us and Cersei. Winter is here. The Lannisters are a southern army. They've never ranged this far north.
28070,"SANSA: You're the military man, but I know her. If you're her enemy, she'll never stop until she's destroyed you. Everyone who's ever crossed her, she's found a way to murder."
28071,JON: You almost sound as if you admire her.
28072,SANSA: I learned a great deal from her.
28073,JAIME: What is this?
28074,"CERSEI: Its what we've been waiting for our whole lives. It's what Father trained us for, whether he knew it or not."
28075,"JAIME: He knew it. Made me memorize every damn city, town, lake, forest, and mountain."
28076,"CERSEI: It's ours now, we just have to take it."
28077,NARRATOR:CERSEI turns to face JAIME.
28078,CERSEI: You've been quiet since you came home. Are you angry with me?
28079,"JAIME: No, not angry."
28080,CERSEI: Are you afraid of me?
28081,JAIME: Should I be?
28082,"CERSEI: Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand. Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne. Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel. He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada. Where will they land?"
28083,JAIME: Dragonstone.
28084,NARRATOR:JAIME approaches the depiction of Dragonstone in the mural and stands over it.
28085,"JAIME: They have deep-water ports for the ships. Stannis left the castle unoccupied, and that's where she was born."
28086,CERSEI: Enemies to the east.
28087,NARRATOR:CERSEI walks towards Dorne on the mural.
28088,CERSEI: Enemies to the south--Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches.
28089,NARRATOR:CERSEI walks towards Highgarden on the mural.
28090,"CERSEI: Enemies to the west--Olenna, the old cunt. Another traitor."
28091,NARRATOR:CERSEi walks towards the North on the mural.
28092,CERSEI: Enemies to the north. Ned Stark's bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him. Enemies everywhere. We're surrounded by traitors. You're in command of the Lannister army now. How do we proceed?
28093,"JAIME: Winter is here. We can't win a war if we can't feed our men and our horses. The Tyrells have the grain, the Tyrells have the livestock."
28094,CERSEI: Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers?
28095,"JAIME: If they think Daenerys will win. No one wants to fight on the losing side. Right now, we look like the losing side."
28096,CERSEI: I'm the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
28097,"JAIME: Three kingdoms, at best. I'm not sure you understand how much danger we're in."
28098,CERSEI: I understand we're in a war for survival. I understand whoever loses dies. I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years.
28099,JAIME: A dynasty for whom? Our children are dead. We're the last of us.
28100,"CERSEI: A dynasty for us, then."
28101,JAIME: We never talked about Tommen.
28102,NARRATOR:CERSEi turns and walks to a nearby table and pours herself a glass of wine.
28103,CERSEI: There's nothing to say.
28104,JAIME: Our baby boy killed himself.
28105,"CERSEI: He betrayed me. He betrayed us both. Should we spend our days mourning the dead--mother, father, and all our children?"
28106,JAIME: Cersei--
28107,"CERSEI: I loved them. I did. But they're ashes now and we're still flesh and blood. We're the last Lannisters, the last ones who count."
28108,JAIME: Even Lannisters can't survive without allies. Where are our allies now? You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family.
28109,CERSEI: I heard. How could we ever trust a man like that?
28110,"JAIME: We couldn't. He was a useless, old coward, but the Freys supported us. Now they're all dead. Whoever killed them is no friend of ours. We need allies. Stronger, better allies. We can't win this war alone."
28111,CERSEI: You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing?
28112,"NARRATOR:Ships bearing the kraken sigil of House Greyjoy are sailing into port. CERSEI and JAIME watch the boats from the shore, escorted by GREGOR CLEGANE and several other guards."
28113,JAIME: The Greyjoys? You invited the Greyjoys to King's Landing?
28114,CERSEI: Not all of them.
28115,"JAIME: Well, it looks like all of them."
28116,"CERSEI: I invited Euron Greyjoy, the new King of the Iron Islands. You said yourself we needed stronger, better allies. There you are."
28117,JAIME: How are they better allies? How are they different from the Freys? They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them.
28118,"CERSEI: So does everyone when it suits them. Unlike the Freys, they have ships. And they're good at killing."
28119,"JAIME: They're not good at anything. I know the Ironborn. They're bitter, angry little people. All they know how to do is steal things they can't build or grow themselves."
28120,CERSEI: Euron Greyjoy didn't come here for that.
28121,"JAIME: Oh, what did he come here for, then?"
28122,CERSEI: A queen.
28123,"NARRATOR:CERSEI exits, followed by GREGOR and the guards."
28124,"NARRATOR:CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne, flanked by JAIME and GREGOR. EURON GREYJOY stands at the foot of the throne. Guards line the hall."
28125,"EURON: The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands, they turned on me. Their own uncle. They stole my best ships and ran. Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you."
28126,NARRATOR:EURON points at CERSEI.
28127,"EURON: It's nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members, from what I hear. But still, it bothers me. Murdering them would make me feel a lot better. And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side, I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together."
28128,NARRATOR:EURON starts walking up towards the throne. GREGOR takes a step towards him. EURON stops walking and looks up at him.
28129,"JAIME: You're not a rightful monarch, though, are you?"
28130,NARRATOR:EURON smiles and walks backwards off the steps. GREGOR returns to his previous position.
28131,"JAIME: The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs, but as I recall, you were soundly defeated. Come to mention it, weren't you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet? You certainly caught us there. Very smart move on your part. Of course, we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway. I was there."
28132,"EURON: I remember very well. I saw you. I heard so much talk. The best in the world. No one can stop him. I didn't believe it, to be honesty. But I must say, when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down...it was glorious. Like a dance."
28133,JAIME: The people I was cutting down were your own kin.
28134,EURON: The place was getting crowded. I enjoyed watching it. I truly did.
28135,JAIME: And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys.
28136,"EURON: A good thing for me. If you hadn't crushed us, I wouldn't have gone into exile. If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't be the greatest captain on the 14 seas."
28137,CERSEI: If not the most humble.
28138,"EURON: You're not humble. You're the queen of a great nation. You don't care about the Iron Islands. They're nothing but rocks and bird shit and--and a lot of very unattractive people. The Iron Fleet, on the other hand, that's something else entirely. It's the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen. With the Iron Fleet, you own the seas. You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south."
28139,CERSEI: What do you want in return?
28140,"EURON: Ever since I was a little boy, I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world. So here I am, with a thousand ships and two good hands."
28141,NARRATOR:EURON raises his arms. JAIME's face twists.
28142,CERSEI: I decline your proposal.
28143,EURON: Why?
28144,CERSEI: You're not trustworthy. You've broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity. You murdered your own brother.
28145,EURON: You should try it. Feels wonderful.
28146,NARRATOR:EURON chuckles. JAIME looks at CERSEI.
28147,"EURON: I don't expect you to trust me outright. You need proof of my honest intentions. In my experience, the surest way to a woman's heart is with a gift. A priceless gift. I won't return to King's Landing until I have that for you."
28148,NARRATOR:EURON turns and exits the Great Hall.
28149,NARRATOR:SAM retrieves a bedpan from beneath one of the beds. He gags.

28169,NARRATOR:SAM continues his duties.
28170,"NARRATOR:SAM wipes his brow. He stares at the gate, then looks over his shoulder, then back at the gate. He walks over to the gate, takes hold of the bars, and looks through. The gate rattles. He focuses on an open book. He hears a chain rattling, hurries to a bookshelf,"
28171,"NARRATOR:and pretends to be placing a book on it. A maester comes around the corner, walks down past him to the gate, unlocks it, enters, and locks it behind him. SAM watches him."
28172,"NARRATOR:ARCHMAESTER MARWYN is performing an autopsy. SAM stands on the other side of the table, watching."
28173,"MARWYN: Ah, Maester Weyland. A drinker's liver if ever I saw one."
28174,NARRATOR:MARWYN removes the liver and hands it to SAM.
28175,MARWYN: Weigh that.
28176,NARRATOR:SAM walks over to the scales.
28177,MARWYN: The triumph of transitory pleasures. Mankind's curse.
28178,NARRATOR:SAM puts the liver on one side of the scale and places weights on the other side.
28179,"SAM: Archmaester, I was wondering..."
28180,MARWYN: What's the weight?
28181,"SAM: Um, 147."
28182,"NARRATOR:MARWYN walks over to an open ledger, picks up a quill, and writes the number 147."
28183,SAM: I was wondering if you had considered my proposition.
28184,MARWYN: I don't remember your proposition.
28185,"SAM: I asked you if, in light of what I've seen in the North, if I could have access to the restricted area of the library."
28186,MARWYN: That area is reserved for maesters. Are you a maester?
28187,SAM: No.
28188,"MARWYN: Not a very strong proposition, is it?"
28189,NARRATOR:MARWYN hands SAM the heart. SAM takes it to the scales.
28190,"SAM: Archmaester, with respect, I've seen them--the Army of the Dead. The white walkers. W was sent here to learn how to defeat them, but everyone in the Citadel, those who will even talk to me, they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place."
28191,MARWYN: Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything. It's their job. But the tales of the Long Night can't be pure fabrication. Too many similarities from unconnected sources.
28192,SAM: Sources in the restricted area?
28193,MARWYN: The very same. And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.
28194,"SAM: So, you believe me."
28195,MARWYN: I do. You'll finish weighing that heart?
28196,SAM: That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does.
28197,"MARWYN: We're not lie the people south of the Twins. And we're not like the people north of the Twins. In the Citadel, we lead different lives for different reasons. We are this world's memory, Samwell Tarly. Without us, men would be little better than dogs. Don't remember any meal but the last, can't see forward to any but the next. And every time you leave the house and shut the door, they howl like you're gone forever. When Robert's Rebellion was raging, people that the end was near. The end of the Targaryen dynasty. ""How will we survive?"" When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush--""The end is near! How will we survive?"" And thousands of year before that, during the Long Night, we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end. But it wasn't. None of it was. The Wall has stood through it all. And every winter that ever came has ended."
28198,NARRATOR:MARWYN closes the ledger.
28199,MARWYN: Be a good lad. Clean this up.
28200,NARRATOR:MARWYN exits. SAM stares at the body.

28203,NARRATOR:He grabs several books and stuffs them in a satchel.
28204,BRIENNE: Nope.

28206,BRIENNE: Nope.
28207,NARRATOR:TORMUND approaches and stares at BRIENNE. BRIENNE looks at him. POD catches her off guard and tags her shoulder with his blade. She punches him in his gut and tosses him in the snow. TORMUND looks at POD.
28208,TORMUND: You're a lucky man.
28209,"NARRATOR:PETYR BAELISH and SANSA stand on a walkway above the courtyard, watching BRIENNE and POD."
28210,PETYR:  I've heard she beat the Hound in single combat. She's a very impressive woman.
28211,"SANSA: What do you want, Lord Baelish?"
28212,PETYR: I want you to be happy. I want you to be safe.
28213,"SANSA: I am safe. I'm at home, surrounded by friends. I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me."
28214,PETYR: What about happy? Why aren't you happy? What do you want that you do not have?
28215,"SANSA: At the moment, peace and quiet."
28216,NARRATOR:BRIENNE walks up the stairs. PETYR motions to speak.

28223,BRIENNE: Why is he still here?
28224,NARRATOR:SANSA sighs.
28225,"SANSA: We need his men. Without the Vale, Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle. Littlefinger saved us."
28226,NARRATOR:BRIENNE nods and watches PETYR walk across the courtyard.
28227,BRIENNE: He wants something.
28228,SANSA: I know exactly what he wants.
28229,MAN (singing): He rode through the streets of the city / Down from his hill on high / O'er the winds and the steps and the cobble / He rode to a woman's sigh / For she was his secret treasure / She was his shame and his bliss / And a chain and a keep are nothing / Compared to a woman's kiss / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are warm / For hands of gold are always cold / But a woman's hands are--
28230,NARRATOR:ARYA's horse neighs. The men turn to look at her. One stands.
28231,ARYA: That's a pretty song. I've never heard it before.
28232,MAN: It's a new one.
28233,MAN #2: Are you hungry? We've got some rabbit.
28234,ARYA: I don't want to steal your food.

28239,MAN #2: Poor girl.
28240,NARRATOR:The men chuckle.
28241,"ARYA: Not so bad, is it?"
28242,"MAN #3: Depends on your taste, I guess. If you like your streets covered in shit and pig's blood, it's the town for you."
28243,NARRATOR:The men chuckle.
28244,"MAN #2: All my life, I wanted to see the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor, the Dragonpit. Then when I finally make it, they wouldn't let me within a mile of the Red Keep, the Sept of Baelor's blown to hell, and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin."
28245,"MAN #3: The people who live there, they'd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide."
28246,MAN: Worst place in the world.
28247,ARYA: What are you doing in the Riverlands?
28248,"MAN #3: There's been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins, so we're part of the army that's been sent to keep the peace."
28249,MAN #2: Here you go. Guests first.
28250,NARRATOR:MAN #2 passes ARYA a cooked rabbit.
28251,"ARYA: Oh, no, I couldn't. You don't have enough."
28252,MAN #2: My mother always told me to be kind to strangers. Strangers will be kind to you.
28253,NARRATOR:ARYA pulls some meat of the rabbit's bone and eats it.
28254,"ARYA: You're a long way from home. I'm sure you've had some adventures, though."
28255,"MAN #2: Yeah, endless adventures. They'll be singing about us for a thousand years."
28256,NARRATOR:The men laugh.
28257,"NARRATOR:MAN #3; The truth is when we left home, we couldn't wait to get away. But now we've been gone a while, we can't wait to get home."
28258,MAN #2: I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone. I ought o be out there with him.
28259,MAN #3: My wife's just had our first baby.
28260,ARYA: Boy or girl?
28261,"MAN #3: Oh, who knows? You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?"
28262,NARRATOR:The men laugh.
28263,MAN #3: I hope it's a girl.
28264,ARYA: Why?
28265,MAN #3: Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old. Boys just go off to fight in someone else's wars.
28266,MAN #2: Are you old enough to drink?
28267,NARRATOR:ARYA nods. MAN #2 passes a skin of wine to ARYA. She uncorks it and drinks.
28268,MAN #2: It's blackberry wine. I made it myself.
28269,ARYA: It's really good.
28270,"MAN #3: So, why is a nice girl on her own heading to King's Landing?"
28271,NARRATOR:ARYA drinks.
28272,ARYA: I'm going to kill the queen.
28273,"NARRATOR:The men fall silent, then everyone laughs."
28274,"NARRATOR:The farm is covered in snow and the wind howls. SANDOR CLEGANE, THOROS OF MYR, BERIC DONDARRION, and several other members of the Brotherhood Without Banners ride into view."
28275,THOROS: Bad night to be outdoors.
28276,"SANDOR: You've got real powerful magic to figure that out. Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear? ""It's snowing, Thoros. It's windy. It's gonna be a cold night."""
28277,"THOROS: You're a grouchy old bear, aren't you, Clegane? You want some rum?"
28278,NARRATOR:THOROS holds out a skin of rum to SANDOR.
28279,SANDOR: Don't like that shit. It's too sweet.
28280,THOROS: Why are you always in such a foul mood?
28281,SANDOR: Experience.
28282,NARRATOR:The horses all stop.
28283,BERIC: This seems like a good place to spend the night.
28284,NARRATOR:They all stare at a nearby farmhouse.
28285,SANDOR: These people don't want us here.
28286,BERIC: Seems deserted to me. No livestock. No smoke coming from the chimney.
28287,NARRATOR:BERIC urges his horse onward. The others follow.
28288,SANDOR: I don't like the look of it.
28289,NARRATOR:THOROS dismounts his horse.
28290,"THOROS: For a big, hard man, you scare easy."
28291,SANDOR: I'll tell you what doesn't scare me: bald cocksuckers like you. You think you're fooling anyone with that top knot? Bald cunt.
28292,NARRATOR:THOROS smiles.
28293,THOROS: Come on. Maybe they've got some ale hidden away.
28294,SANDOR: They don't.
28295,"NARRATOR:Some of the Brothers enter the farmhouse, followed by THOROS."
28296,THOROS: See if there's a larder. They always leave something behind.
28297,NARRATOR:The Brothers rummage around the farmhouse. SANDOR enters.
28298,"NARRATOR:He stares at two skeletons in the corner, one adult-sized and the other child-sized. BERIC enters, sees the skeletons, and walks up beside SANDOR."
28299,BERIC: How do you think it ended for them?
28300,SANDOR: With death.
28301,"BERIC: Girl died in her father's arms. Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet. I'd say they were starving. And rather than letting his little girl suffer, he ended it for both of them."
28302,SANDOR: Doesn't matter now.
28303,"BERIC: No, doesn't matter now."
28304,NARRATOR:SANDOR sits at the table. BERIC joins him. SANDOR bites into a hunk of bread. THOROS starts a fire in the fireplace.
28305,"SANDOR: I've known you a long time, Dondarrion."
28306,BERIC: Aye. I think the first time we met was at that tournament--
28307,SANDOR: And I always thought you were dull as dirt.
28308,NARRATOR:BERIC chuckles.
28309,"SANDOR: You're not bad. I don't hate you. Don't like, but you're not bad."
28310,"BERIC: Thank you, Clegane. That warms the heart."
28311,SANDOR: But there's nothing special about you.
28312,BERIC: You're right about that.
28313,"SANDOR: So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back? I've met better men than you, and they've been hanged from crossbeams, or beheaded, or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere. None of them came back. So, why you?"
28314,BERIC: You think I don't ask myself that? Every hour of every day? Why am I here? What am I supposed to do? What does the Lord see in me?
28315,SANDOR: And?
28316,BERIC: I don't know. I don't understand our Lord.
28317,SANDOR: Your Lord.
28318,BERIC: I don't know what He wants from me. I only know that He wants me alive.
28319,"SANDOR: If he's so all-powerful, why doesn't he just tell you what the fuck he wants?"
28320,THOROS: Clegane.
28321,"NARRATOR:SANDOR looks at THOROS, who is kneeling by the fire."
28322,THOROS: Come over here. Don't worry. The fire won't bite. I want to show you something.
28323,SANDOR: It's my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers.
28324,BERIC: Aye. Almost seems like divine justice.
28325,"SANDOR: There's no divine justice, you dumb cunt. If there was, you'd be dead...and that girl would be alive."
28326,NARRATOR:SANDOR stands and walks closer to the fire.
28327,SANDOR: What do you want?
28328,THOROS: Look into the flames.
28329,SANDOR: I don't want to look in the damn flames.
28330,THOROS: You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down. Don't you want to know what gave me the power?
28331,SANDOR: I keep asking and no one wants to tell me.
28332,THOROS: We can't tell you. Only the fire can tell you.
28333,NARRATOR:SANDOR approaches the fire and looks into it.
28334,THOROS: What do you see?
28335,SANDOR: Logs burning.
28336,THOROS: Keep looking. What do you see?
28337,NARRATOR:SANDOR's face twists.
28338,SANDOR: Ice. A wall of ice. The Wall.
28339,THOROS: What else?
28340,SANDOR: It's where the Wall meets the sea. There's a castle there.
28341,NARRATOR:The fire crackles.
28342,SANDOR: There's a mountain. Looks like an arrowhead. The dead are marching past.
28343,NARRATOR:BERIC stands and approaches the fire.
28344,SANDOR: Thousands of them.
28345,"BERIC: Do you believe me now, Clegane? Do you believe we're here for a reason?"
28346,NARRATOR:Thoros wakes to the sound of shoveling. He picks up his sword and a lantern and exits the farmhouse. SANDOR is outside digging a grave.
28347,"THOROS: What the hell are you doing, Clegane?"
28348,NARRATOR:SANDOR plants his shovel in the ground.
28349,SANDOR: Burying the dead.
28350,"NARRATOR:SANDOR walks over to the body of the child, lifts it up, kneels down, and places it in the hole."
28351,THOROS: You knew these people.
28352,SANDOR: Not really.
28353,"NARRATOR:SANDOR stands, walks over to the body of the adult, lifts it up, kneels down, and places it in the hole. Then he stands and starts shoveling dirt into the hole. THOROS plants his sword in the ground and puts down his lantern, then picks up a shovel and begins helping SANDOR bury the bodies. When they're finished,"
28354,NARRATOR:they stand over the grave.
28355,"SANDOR: We ask the Father to judge us with mercy. We ask the Mother to... Fuck it, I don't remember the rest. I'm sorry you're dead. You deserved better. Both of you."
28356,NARRATOR:SANDOR tosses down his shovel and exits. THOROS watches him leave.
28357,LITTLE SAM: Mom.
28358,NARRATOR:GILLY turns to SAM.
28359,"GILLY: You should really sleep, Sam."
28360,SAM: The dead don't.
28361,"NARRATOR:GILLY stands, carries a book over to the table, and sits."
28362,"GILLY: ""Legends of the Long Night."""
28363,NARRATOR:GILLY opens the book.
28364,SAM: The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for.
28365,NARRATOR:SAM sighs and turns the page. There is a diagram of a knife on the page. He turns the page again. There is a map on the page. SAM looks more closely at the map.
28366,GILLY: What is it?
28367,SAM: It's a map of Dragonstone. The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.
28368,NARRATOR:SAM points to a section of the map depicting a cave surrounded by a black mass.
28369,GILLY: That's dragonglass?
28370,"SAM: A mountain of it. Beneath the ground. Stannis told me, but I didn't think... This is important. Jon needs to know."
28371,NARRATOR:SAM grabs a quill and begins writing.
28372,"NARRATOR:SAM wheels a cart along the hall. He removes a bowl from a folded-out plank in the door beside him and folds the plank back up. He puts the bowl on the cart and pushes it further down the hall. He approaches the next door, picks up the bowl, and folds in the plank. A man can be heard vomiting and coughing inside. SAM puts the bowl on the cart and pushes it further down the hall. He approaches the next door and reaches for the bowl, but a hand lurches out from the hole in the door and grabs the bowl. SAM jumps backwards and gasps. The arm of the person behind the door is covered in grayscale, revealing it belongs to JORAH MORMONT. JORAH drops the bowl on the floor."
28373,JORAH: Has she come yet?
28374,SAM: Who?
28375,JORAH: The Dragon Queen. Daenerys Stormborn.
28376,SAM: Haven't heard anything.
28377,NARRATOR:JORAH pulls his hand back inside the cell. SAM approaches and folds up the plank.
28378,"NARRATOR:Everyone gets out of the rowboat. DAENERYS walks on ahead. She kneels down and presses her palm to the sand, then stares up at the castle and walks further down the beach. The others follow. They climb the steps and approach a gate flanked by two statues of dragon heads. Two Unsullied approach the gate and push it open, revealing a walkway up to the castle. DAENERYS, TYRION, MISSANDEI, GREY WORM, and VARYS walk through the gates and up the walkway. They enter the foyer. A tapestry bearing the stag sigil of House Baratheon is hanging off to the side. DAENERYS approaches it and tears it down. DAENERYS approaches a set of doors. Two Unsullied open them for her. She enters the throne room, followed by the others. VARYS and MISSANDEI stop following her. GREY WORM starts to continue onward but MISSANDEI puts her hand on his chest to stop him. DAENERYS approaches the throne and stares at it. TYRION looks around the hall. DAENERYS ascends the steps but walks past the throne into the Chamber of the Painted Table. TYRION follows. DAENERYS walks alongside the table and runs her fingers across it. TYRION walks alongside the table opposite her and stares at the dragon carvings on the wall. DAENERYS stands at the head of the table and stares down at the map of Westeros. TYRION looks at her."
28379,DAENERYS: Shall we begin?
28380,NARRATOR:CREDITS
28381,"TYRION: On a night like this, you came into the world."
28382,VARYS: I remember that storm. All the dogs in King's Landing howled through the night.
28383,DAENERYS: I wish I could remember it.
28384,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns away from the window and walks over to the table.
28385,DAENERYS: I always thought this would be a homecoming. It doesn't feel like home.
28386,TYRION: We won't stay on Dragonstone for long.
28387,DAENERYS: Good.
28388,NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks at the figurines placed on the table
28389,DAENERYS: Not so many lions.
28390,"VARYS: Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms. The lord of Westeros despise her. Even before your arrival, they plotted against her. Now..."
28391,DAENERYS: They cry out for their true queen? They drink secret toasts to my health?
28392,NARRATOR:DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.
28393,"DAENERYS: People used to tell my brother that sort of thing, and he was stupid enough to believe them."
28394,NARRATOR:DAENERYS picks up a dragon figurine from the table.
28395,"DAENERYS: If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back, he'd have invaded King's Landing already."
28396,TYRION: Conquering Westeros would be easy for you. But you're not here to be queen of the ashes.
28397,DAENERYS: No.
28398,NARRATOR:DAENERYS puts down the dragon figurine.
28399,"TYRION: We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse. If the great houses support your claim against Cersei, the game is won. With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side, we have powerful allies in the south."
28400,NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks at VARYS.
28401,DAENERYS: I never properly thanked you for that.
28402,"VARYS: They joined our side, my queen, because they believe in you."
28403,"DAENERYS: You served my father, didn't you, Lord Varys?"
28404,VARYS: I did.
28405,DAENERYS: And then you served the man who overthrew him?
28406,"VARYS: I had a choice, Your Grace--serve Robert Baratheon or face the headman's axe."
28407,DAENERYS: But you didn't serve him long. You turned against him.
28408,"VARYS: Robert was an improvement on your father, to be sure. There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King. Robert was neither mad nor cruel. He simply had no interest in being king."
28409,DAENERYS: So you took it upon yourself to find a better one.
28410,"TYRION: Your Grace, when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin, Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who--"
28411,"DAENERYS (to VARYS): Before I came to power, you favored my brother. All your spies, your little birds, did they tell you Viserys was cruel, stupid, and weak? Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion?"
28412,"VARYS: Until your marriage to Khal Drogo, Your Grace, I knew nothing about you, save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful."
28413,DAENERYS: So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki.
28414,VARYS: Which you turned to your advantage.
28415,DAENERYS: Who gave the order to kill me?
28416,VARYS: King Robert.
28417,DAENERYS: Who hired the assassins?
28418,NARRATOR:DAENERYS walks closer to VARYS.
28419,DAENERYS: Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen?
28420,"VARYS: Your Grace, I did what had to be done to--"
28421,DAENERYS: To keep yourself alive.
28422,TYRION: Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant.
28423,"DAENERYS: Proven himself loyal? Quite the opposite. If he dislikes one monarch, he conspires to crown the next one. What king of a servant is that?"
28424,"VARYS: The kind the realm needs. Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, I'll use them. I wasn't born into a great house. I came from nothing. I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering. When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie? Not with any king or queen, but with the people. The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule. The people whose hearts you aim to win. If you demand blind allegiance, I respect your wishes. Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me. But if you let me live, I will serve you well. I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you. Because I know the people have no better chance than you."
28425,"DAENERYS: Swear this to me, Varys. If you ever think I'm failing the people, you won't conspire behind my back. You'll look me in the eye as you have done today, and you'll tell me how I'm failing them."
28426,"VARYS: I swear it, my queen."
28427,"DAENERYS: And I swear this--if you ever betray me, I'll burn you alive."
28428,NARRATOR:VARYS smiles.
28429,VARYS: I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons.
28430,"GREY WORM: Forgive me, my queen. A red priestess from As'shai has come to see you."
28431,"NARRATOR:MELISANDRE is standing alone in the throne room. DAENERYS enters, accompanied by TYRION, VARYS, MISSANDEI, and GREY WORM. They approach MELISANDRE."
28432,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian.
28433,"MELISANDRE:  Queen Daeneys, I was a slave once, bought and sold, scourged and branded.  It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains."
28434,DAENERYS:  The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen.  You are very welcome here.  What is your name?
28435,MELISANDRE:  I am called Melisandre.
28436,NARRATOR:VARYS begins speaking English.
28437,"VARYS:  She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne.  It didn't end well for Stannis Baratheon, did it?"
28438,"MELISANDRE:  No, it didn't."
28439,DAENERYS:  You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone.
28440,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to look at Varys.
28441,DAENERYS:  We've just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king.
28442,NARRATOR:VARYS bows his head to DAENERYS.  DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE.
28443,"DAENERYS:  The Lord of Light doesn't have  many followers in Westeros, does he?"
28444,MELISDANDRE:  Not yet.   But even those who don't worship the Lord can serve his cause.
28445,DAENERYS:  What does your Lord expect from me?
28446,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE begins speaking Valyrian again.
28447,MELISANDRE:  The Long Night is coming.  Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn.
28448,NARRATOR:DAENERYS speaking in English.
28449,DAENERYS:  The prince who was promised will bring the dawn.  I'm afraid I'm not a prince.
28450,"MISSANDEI:  Your Grace, forgive me, but your translation is not quite accurate.  That noun has no gender in High Valyrian, so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn."
28451,"TYRION:  Doesn't really roll off the tongue, does it?"
28452,"DAENERYS:  No, but I like it better."
28453,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns back to MELISANDRE.
28454,DAENERYS:  And you believe this prophecy refers to me?
28455,"MELISANDRE:  Prophecies are dangerous things.  I believe you have a role to play, as does another.  The King in the North, Jon Snow."
28456,TYRION:  Jon Snow?  Ned Stark's bastard?
28457,DAENERYS:  You know him?
28458,TYRION:  I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Night's Watch.
28459,"VARYS:  And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions you've seen in the flames, that is?"
28460,MELISANDRE:  As Lord Commander of the Night's Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger.  As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy.
28461,DAENERYS:  He sounds like quite a man.
28462,"MELISANDRE:  Summon Jon Snow.  Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him, the things that he has seen with his own eyes."
28463,"TYRION:  I can't speak to prophecies or visions in the flames, but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him, and I am an excellent judge of character."
28464,NARRATOR:DARNERYS smiles at Tyrion.
28465,"TYRION:  If he does rule the north, he would make a valuable ally.  The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother.  Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do."
28466,NARRATOR:DAENERYS pauses for a moment.
28467,DAENERYS:  Very well.  Send a raven north.  Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone...and bend the knee.
28468,"NARRATOR:Young boys and girls are practicing archery.  JON, SANSA and DAVOS stand on the upper level watching the training."
28469,SANSA:  Do you think it's really Tyrion?  It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap.
28470,JON:  Read the last bit.
28471,"SANSA:  ""All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes.""  What does that mean?"
28472,JON:  It's something he said to me the first night we met.  You know him better than any of us.  What do you think?
28473,"SANSA:  Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters.  He was always kind to me, but it's too great a risk.  ""The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne.  Join us.  Together we can end her tyranny."""
28474,"DAVOS:  Sounds like a charmer.  Of course, the casual mention of a Dothraki horde, a legion of Unsullied and three dragons, a bit less charming."
28475,NARRATOR:DAVOS pauses to ponder something.
28476,JON:  What?
28477,"DAVOS:  Fire kills Whites, you told me.  What breathes fire?"
28478,SANSA:  You're not suggesting Jon meet with her?
28479,"DAVOS:  No, too dangerous."
28480,JON:  But?
28481,"DAVOS:  But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall, do we have enough men to fight them?"
28482,NARRATOR:JON gazes back to the courtyard looking concerned.
28483,"NARRATOR:CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne.  She is surrounded by JAIME, QYBURN, THE MOUNTAIN and members of her Queensguard.  Many lords are in attendance including RANDYLL TARLEY."
28484,"CERSEI:  If the Mad King's daughter takes the Iron Throne, she will destroy the Realm as we know it.  Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell.  But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown.  With their help the Mad King's daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores.  Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts.  Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground, rape and enslave your women, and butcher your children without a second thought.  This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty."
28485,NARRATOR:The lords begin murmuring amongst themselves.
28486,"CERSEI:  You all remember the Mad King.  You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people.  His daughter is no different.  In Essos her brutality is already legendary.  She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slaver's Bay.  And when she grew bored of that, she fed them to her dragons."
28487,NARRATOR:The lords murmur louder
28488,"CERSEI:  It is my solemn duty to protect the people, and I will but I need your help, My Lords.  We must stand together, all of us, if we hope to stop her."
28489,NARRATOR:RANDYLL TARLEY slowly approaches the throne.
28490,"RANDYLL:  She has three full-grown dragons, Your Grace.  The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms.  How do you propose to stop them?"
28491,NARRATOR:CERSEI glances over to QYBURN.
28492,"QYBURN:  We are currently at work on a solution, My Lord."
28493,NARRATOR:The meeting disbands.  All the lords walk out into the hall outside of the throne room.  JAIME approaches RANDYLL TARLEY and begins to walk with him.
28494,JAIME:  Lord Tarley.
28495,"RANDYLL:  Ser, Jaime.  I believe you know my son."
28496,"DICKON:  Ser, Jaime."
28497,"JAIME:  Rickon, isn't it?"
28498,DICKON:  Dickon.
28499,JAIME:  That's it.
28500,NARRATOR:JAIME walks past Dickon and begins a discussion with Randyll
28501,JAIME:  Thank you for coming.  The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever.  They might not have come if you hadn't.
28502,"RANDYLL:  If my queen summons me, I answer the call.  And I've heard what she does to those that defy her."
28503,NARRATOR:JAIME and RANDYLL walk to an unoccupied hallway and continue their conversation.
28504,JAIME:  Do you ride for Hornhill today?
28505,RANDYLL:  I have an army to mobilize.  It won't be long until the fighting starts.
28506,JAIME:  And what side will you be fighting for?  You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle.  Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could --
28507,"RANDYLL:  It's a long ride back to the reach, Ser Jaime.  How may I serve?"
28508,JAIME:  I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.  I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies.  All of her enemies.
28509,RANDYLL:  Including Olenna Tyrell?  I'm a Tarley.  That name means something.  We're not oath breakers.  We're not schemers.  We don't stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings.   I swore an oath to House Tyrell.
28510,"JAIME:  You swore an oath to the Crown as well, Lord Tarley."
28511,RANDYLL:  I've known Olenna since I was a child.
28512,"JAIME:  She was a great woman, once.  Now she's broken.  She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores.  The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history.  I know you don't like my sister, but you have to make a choice.  Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs?"
28513,NARRATOR:RANDYLL nods his head in agreement
28514,JAIME:  When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south.  I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley.
28515,"NARRATOR:ARCHMAESTER MARWYN, SAMWELL and JORAH are standing together in the quarantine room.  JORAH's upper body is covered in Greyscale except his face."
28516,MARWYN:  The infection has spread too far.  You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched.
28517,JORAH:  How long?
28518,"MARWYN:  It will be years before it kills you.  It could be 10, could be 20."
28519,JORAH:  But how long 'till...
28520,"MARWYN:  Your mind?  Six months, maybe fewer."
28521,NARRATOR:JORAH sighs and sits down on his bed.  SAMWELL approaches MARWYN.
28522,"SAMWELL: Pardon, Archmaester.  I met Stannis Baratheon's daughter at Castle Black.  She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured.  Isn't there some way --"
28523,MARWYN:  Does this look like a baby to you?
28524,SAMWELL:  No.
28525,MARWYN:  Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men?
28526,SAMWELL:  No.
28527,MARWYN:  Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheon's affliction immediately.
28528,NARRATOR:MARWYN turns to face JORAH.
28529,"MARWYN:  This is quite advanced and beyond our skills, Ser.  Were you a commoner I'd have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men.  As an anointed Knight I'll allow you one more day.  How you choose to spend that time is up to you."
28530,NARRATOR:JORAH nods his head.  MARWYN turns to leave the room and begins walking to the door.
28531,"MARWYN:  Come, Samwell."
28532,"SAMWELL:  Should we send word to your family, Ser..."
28533,JORAH:  Jorah.  Jorah Mormont.
28534,SAMWELL:  Mormont?
28535,JORAH:  There's no need.  I've been dead to them for years.
28536,NARRATOR:MARWYN is waiting for SAMWELL in the hallway
28537,"MARWYN:  Come, Samwell."
28538,NARRATOR:SAMWELL turns and walks out of the room.  He closes the door to the quarantine room.
28539,NARRATOR:QYBURN and CERSEI are walking along the torch lit dungeon passing the dragon skulls.
28540,"QYBURN:  Have you ever been down here, Your Grace?"
28541,"CERSEI:  No, I can't say I have.  I haven't seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room."
28542,QYBURN:  Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed.
28543,CERSEI:  They were his trophies.  He couldn't keep them around.  They would have made him look small.  Sometimes he would come down here and look at them.  I believe he brought his whores on occasion.
28544,NARRATOR:QYBURN and CERSEI arrive at the end of the dungeon.  They are looking at the largest dragon skull in the room.
28545,"QYBURN:  Balerion the Dread.  The beast that Aegon rode across the sea.  Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel.  Powerful, but not invincible."
28546,NARRATOR:QYBURN turns and starts walking away from the dragon skull.
28547,"QYBURN:  Apparently one of Daenarys' dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen.  If they can be wounded, they can be killed."
28548,NARRATOR:QYBURN walks up to a machine covered by a cloth.  He reaches up and removes the cloth revealing an artillery-sized crossbow aimed at Balerion's skull.
28549,"QYBURN:  The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in King's Landing have been laboring day and night, Your Grace.  If you'd kindly pull that lever."
28550,NARRATOR:CERSEI releases a lever on the machine and launches a giant bolt directly into Balerion's eye socket.  The bolt buries deep into the skull and gets stuck.  CERSEI stands behind the machine smirking.
28551,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS, YARA GREYJOY, THEON GREYJOY, ELLARIA SAND, OLENNA TYRELL, VARYS, GREY WORM, MISSANDEI, and TYRION LANNISTER are standing around a carved table of Westeros having a discussion."
28552,"YARA:  If you want the Iron Throne, take it.  We have an army, a fleet, and three dragons.  We should hit King's Landing now.  Hard.  With everything we have.  The city will fall within a day."
28553,"TYRION:  If we turn the dragons loose, tens of thousands will die in the firestorms."
28554,NARRATOR:ELLARIA looks at TYRION with disgust.
28555,"ELLARIA:  It's called war.  You don't have the stomach for it, scurry back into hiding."
28556,TYRION:    I know how you wage war.  We don't poison little girls here.  Myrcella was innocent.
28557,ELLARIA:  She was a Lannister.  There are no innocent Lannisters.  My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you.
28558,DAENERYS:  That's enough.  Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen.  You will treat him with respect.
28559,NARRATOR:DAENERYS pauses for a moment.
28560,DAENERYS:  I am not here to be queen of the ashes.
28561,NARRATOR:OLENNA addresses DAENERYS from across the table.
28562,"OLENNA:  That's very nice to hear.  Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter.  The common people loved her, the nobles loved her.  And what is left of her now?  Ashes.  Commoners, nobles, they're all just children really.  They won't obey you unless they fear you."
28563,"DAENERYS:  I'm grateful to you, Lady Olenna, for your council.  I'm grateful to all of you.  But you have chosen to follow me.  I will not attack King's Landing.  We will not attack King's Landing."
28564,OLEANNA:  Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne?  By asking nicely?
28565,DAENERYS:  We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides.  Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people.
28566,TYRION:  But we won't use Dothraki and Unsullied.
28567,NARRATOR:TYRION begins walking around the carved table of Westeros.
28568,"TYRION:  Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty, their love for their country.  If we besiege the city with foreigners, we prove her point.  Our army should be Westerosi."
28569,ELLIA:  And I suppose we're providing the Westerosi?
28570,TYRION:  You are.
28571,NARRATOR:TYRION reaches down and picks up a figurine that resembles a Kraken in a longship.
28572,TYRION:  Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to King's Landing.
28573,NARRATOR:TYRION walks to the south of the map and picks up a figurine that resembles a sun.  He takes both figurines and places them at King's Landing.
28574,TYRION:  The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army.  Two great kingdoms united against Cersei.
28575,"OLENNA:  So, your master plan is to use our armies?  Forgive me for asking, but why did you bother to bring your own?"
28576,NARRATOR:TYRION reaches down and picks up the figurine resembling an Unsullied helmet.  He begins walking back around the map of Westeros.
28577,TYRION:  The unsullied will have another objective.  For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros.  And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock.  Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it.
28578,NARRATOR:TYRION stops in front of Casterly Rock.  There is a figurine that resembles a lion.  He knocks the lion over with the Unsullied figurine.  Everyone in the room nods in agreement.
28579,DAENERYS:  Do I have your support?
28580,YARA:  You have mine.
28581,"ELLIA:  Dorne is with you, Your Grace."
28582,NARRATOR:Lady Olenna nods her head in agreement.
28583,"DAENERYS:  Thank you all.  Lady Olenna, may I speak with you alone?"
28584,NARRATOR:Everyone except DAENERYS and OLENNA leave the Chamber of the Painted Table.  DAENERYS walks to the end and sits next to OLENNA.
28585,DAENERYS:  I realize you're here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me.  But I swear to you she will pay for what she's done and we will bring peace back to Westeros.
28586,"OLENNA:  Peace.  Do you think that's what we had under your father or his father or his?  Peace never lasts, my dear.  Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman?"
28587,NARRATOR:DAENERYS nods her hod in agreement
28588,"OLENNA:  He's a clever man, your Hand.  I've known a great many clever men.  I've outlived them all.  Do you know why?  I ignored them.  The lords of Westeros are sheep.  Are you a sheep?  No.  You're a dragon.  Be a dragon."
28589,NARRATOR:GREY WORM is sitting sharpening his sword.  Someone knocks on his door.  He begins speaking Valyrian.
28590,GREY WORM:   Enter.
28591,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI walks in.  She speaks in English.
28592,MISSANDEI:  You leave tomorrow.  Were you going to say goodbye?
28593,GREY WORM:  I will see you when I return.
28594,MISSANDEI:  But you don't know when that will be.
28595,GREYWORM:  No one knows.
28596,MISSANDEI:  I wish you good fortune.
28597,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI turns and starts to walk out of the room.
28598,GREY WORM:  Missandei --
28599,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI stops and turns back towards GREY WORM.
28600,GREY WORM:  It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.
28601,MISSANDEI:  Why?
28602,GREY WORM:  You know why.
28603,MISSANDEI:  I don't.
28604,GREY WORM:  You are my weakness.
28605,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI appears offended.
28606,MISSANDEI:  That's what I am?  Your weakness?
28607,"GREY WORM:  When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears.  One boy is scared of dogs.  One boy hates high places.  One is frightened of the ocean.  They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff.  They throw him in the water.  If he learns to swim, good.  If he drowns, good.  Either way, strong Unsullied.  But I had no fears.  I was never the biggest, never the strongest, but I was bravest always."
28608,MISSANDEI:  I believe it.
28609,GREY WORM:  Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth.  Now I have fear.
28610,MISSANDEI:  I do too.
28611,NARRATOR:GREY WORM steps forward and kisses MISSANDEI.  MISSANDEI grabs his hands and stops him.  She begins to undress herself.  MISSANDEI steps forward and begins to undress GREY WORM.
28612,GREY WORM:  No.
28613,MISSANDEI:  I want to see you.  Please.
28614,"NARRATOR:GREY WORM hesitates for a moment, then nods his head in agreement.  MISSANDEI finishes undressing GREY WORM.  Sex scene ensues."
28615,NARRATOR:MARWYN and SAMWELL are walking by various shelves in the library.  SAMWELL is carrying a stack of books for MARWYN.
28616,MARWYN:  It might be useful.  Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher.
28617,"SAMWELL:  Archmaester, I wanted to --"
28618,MARWYN:  And this one.
28619,NARRATOR:MARWYN places another book on the stack SAMWELL is carrying.
28620,MARWYN:  Maester Faol was quite the opposite.  A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells.
28621,NARRATOR:MARWYN continues walking
28622,SAMWELL:  I wanted to ask you --
28623,"MARWYN:  If you need to write histories, Tarley, you have to do the research.  If you want people to read your histories, you need a bit of style.  I'm not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread."
28624,NARRATOR:SAMWELL says nothing.
28625,MARWYN: What?  You don't like the title?  What would you call it then?
28626,SAMWELL:  Possibly something a bit more poetic?
28627,"MARWYN:  We're not poets, Tarley."
28628,"SAMWELL:  Archmaester, if I could just have a moment."
28629,MARWYN:  This is your moment.  Use it wisely.
28630,NARRATOR:MARWYN begins looking through books on the shelf.
28631,SAMWELL:  I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah.  There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured.  I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos.
28632,NARRATOR:MARWYN places a book on SAMWELL's stack.  He continues looking at more books.
28633,MARWYN:  I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases.
28634,"SAMWELL:  Oh, you are?"
28635,MARWYN:  Yes.  Should I tell you how he died?  From Greyscale.
28636,NARRATOR:MARWYN places another book on SAMWELL's stack.
28637,SAMWELL:  Oh.
28638,MARWYN:  The procedure is far too dangerous which is why it's now forbidden.
28639,NARRATOR:MARWYN turns and walks out of the library.
28640,CUT TO: QUARANTINE ROOMS
28641,NARRATOR:A few hours have passed.  JORAH is writing a letter to DAENERYS by candlelight in his quarantine room.  He hears a noise in the hallway and stands to face the door.  SAMWELL opens the door and rolls in a cart filled with medical tools and containers.
28642,SAMWELL:  Hello.
28643,JORAH:  What are you doing?
28644,SAMWELL:  You're Jorah Mormont.  You're the only son of Jeor Mormont.
28645,NARRATOR:SAMWELL picks up a roll of leather and sets it on the table.  He unrolls it revealing an assortment of scalpels and knives.
28646,"SAMWELL:  My name is Samwell Tarley.  I'm a sworn brother of the Night's Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black.  I knew your father.  I was with him when he died.  You're not dying today, Ser Jorah."
28647,NARRATOR:SAMWELL picks up a large flask and hands it to JORAH.
28648,SAMWELL:  Drink this.
28649,JORAH:  What is it?
28650,"SAMWELL:  Rum.  Drink it all, please.  I'm afraid this is going to hurt."
28651,NARRATOR:JORAH reaches for the bottle.  SAMWELL grabs it back and drinks some himself before handing it back to JORAH.  JORAH drains the flask.  SAMWELL picks up a thick book from the medical cart and sets it on the table.
28652,SAMWELL:  If you could take off your shirt.
28653,NARRATOR:SAMWELL gives JORAH a strap made of leather.
28654,"SAMWELL:  If you wouldn't mind, bite down hard.  I'm sorry but no one knows I'm here.  If they hear you screaming then we're both finished."
28655,JORAH:  Have you ever done this before?
28656,"SAMWELL:  No.  No one else will try, so I'm the best you've got.  Have a seat.  I'm going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue, then apply a medicinal ointment to the --"
28657,NARRATOR:JORAH looks at SAMWELL to stop him from explaining.  SAMWELL picks up a pair of tweezers and a scalpel.  He grabs a section of Greyscale to cut it off.  JORAH recoils in pain.
28658,"SAMWELL:  Shh,  shhh.  Again, I'm sorry.  Please try not to scream."
28659,NARRATOR:SAMWELL cuts into the Greyscale.  JORAH begins to writhe in agony and whimper.  Pus is dripping from the wound.  SAMWELL continues cutting and slices a layer of Greyscale off JORAH's skin.
28660,CUT TO:  INN AT THE CROSSROADS
28661,NARRATOR:Two men are at a table having a conversation.
28662,MAN #1:  They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons.
28663,MAN #2:  Horse shit.  Cersei is just trying to frighten us.
28664,"MAN #1:  If it's true, if she lays siege to King's Landing prices will triple."
28665,NARRATOR:The camera zooms out showing Arya eavesdropping on the men.
28666,MAN #2:  As long as we get back there before they start.
28667,MAN #1:  One more round.  It's a long ride.
28668,NARRATOR:A waiter approaches Arya's table.
28669,HOT PIE:  Ary!
28670,"ARYA:  Hello, Hot Pie.  Sit down.  Who's that for?"
28671,NARRATOR:Arya reaches over and grabs a potpie from the tray and starts eating it.
28672,ARYA:  Mmm.  This is good.
28673,HOT PIE:    You think so?  The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.  Most people don't don't do that because it takes up too much time.
28674,ARYA:  I didn't do that.
28675,HOT PIE:  You've been making pies?
28676,ARYA:  One or two.
28677,HOT PIE:  I can't believe you're here.  Did you meet the big lady?
28678,ARYA:  Big lady?
28679,HOT PIE:  The lady knight.  I figured she was a knight because she had armor on.  She was looking for your sister but I told her about you.  Did she ever find you?
28680,ARYA:  She found me.
28681,HOT PIE:  What happened to you Ary?
28682,NARRATOR:ARYA pauses and doesn't answer HOT PIE.
28683,ARYA:  You got any ale?
28684,"NARRATOR:Hot Pie starts to reach for a pitcher on the tray.  Arya reaches over and grabs it before him, pouring herself a cup."
28685,HOT PIE:  Where are you heading?
28686,ARYA:  King's Landing.
28687,HOT PIE:  Why?
28688,ARYA:  I heard Cersei's queen now.
28689,HOT PIE:  I heard she blew up the Great Sept.  That must have been something to see.  Boom.
28690,ARYA:  Hmm.
28691,NARRATOR:Arya nods in agreement.
28692,HOT PIE:  I can't believe someone could do that.
28693,ARYA:  Cersei would do that.
28694,HOT PIE:  I thought you'd be heading for Winterfell.
28695,ARYA:  Why would I go there?  The Boltons have it.
28696,HOT PIE:  No.  The Boltons are dead.
28697,NARRATOR:Arya stops eating and drops her food.
28698,ARYA:  What?
28699,HOT PIE:  Jon Snow came down from Castle Black with a Wildling army and won the Battle of the Bastards.  He's King in the North now.
28700,ARYA:  You're lying.
28701,HOT PIE:  Why would I lie about that?  He's your brother right?
28702,NARRATOR:ARYA starts picking up her things to leave.
28703,ARYA:  Thanks for the pie.
28704,NARRATOR:Arya reaches to her side and produces a bag of gold.  She starts to open the pouch.
28705,HOT PIE:  Friends don't pay.  I can't believe I thought you were a boy.  You're pretty.
28706,ARYA:  Thanks.
28707,NARRATOR:Arya stands and walks past Hot Pie.  She turns and puts her hand on his shoulder.
28708,"ARYA:  Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.  Try not to get killed."
28709,"HOT PIE:  No, I won't.  I'm like you, Ary.  I'm a survivor."
28710,NARRATOR:ARYA turns and exits the Inn
28711,CUT TO:  EXT. INN AT THE CROSSROADS
28712,"NARRATOR:ARYA climbs on her horse.  She looks towards the south, then the north.  She makes a decision and turns around to head back north.  She rides off into the distance."
28713,NARRATOR:JON is bent over his desk looking at maps.  There's a knock at the door.
28714,JON:  Come in.
28715,"WOLKAN:  A raven, My King, from the Citadel."
28716,NARRATOR:JON begins reading the scroll.
28717,"NARRATOR:The room is filled with northern lords and ladies including SANSA, JON, BRIENNE, LYANNA MORMONT, ROBETT GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE, and PETER BAELISH.  JON is standing in the great hall holding a message up for the lords to see."
28718,JON:  This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley.  He was my brother at the Night's Watch.  A man I trust as much as anyone in this world.  He's discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass.
28719,NARRATOR:The lords murmur amongst themselves.  JON hands the first note to ROBETT GLOVER.  JON holds up a different note for the lords to see.
28720,JON:  I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone.  It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister.
28721,NARRATOR:The lords murmur louder.
28722,"JON:  He's now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen.  She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister.  She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed, three dragons."
28723,NARRATOR:The lords speak among themselves and look concerned.
28724,JON:  Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and I'm going to accept.
28725,NARRATOR:There is a negative outcry from the lords gathered in the hall
28726,"JON:  We need this Dragonglass, My Lords.  We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army.  We need to mine it and turn it into weapons."
28727,NARRATOR:The lords nod in agreement
28728,"JON:  But more importantly, we need allies.  The Night King's army grows larger by the day.  We can't defeat them on our own.  We don't have the numbers.  Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire.  I need to try and persuade her to fight with us.  Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow, then sail for Dragonstone."
28729,SANSA:  Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather?  The Mad King invited him to King's Landing and roasted him alive.
28730,JON:  I know that.
28731,"SANSA:  She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms.  The north is one of those seven kingdoms.  This isn't an invitation, it's a trap."
28732,"JON:  It could be, but I don't believe Tyrion would do that.  You know him.  He's a good man."
28733,NARRATOR:YOHN ROYCE stands up and turns to face JON.
28734,"YOHN ROYCE:  Your Grace, with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa.  I remember the Mad King all too well.  A Targaryen cannot be trusted, nor can a Lannister."
28735,NARRATOR:The lords shout in agreement.
28736,"ROBETT GLOVER:  We called your brother king, and then he rode south and lost his kingdom."
28737,"LYANNA MORMONT:  Winter is here, Your Grace.  We need the King in the North in the north."
28738,NARRATOR:The lords pound the tables in agreement.
28739,"JON:  You all crowned me your king.  I never wanted it, I never asked for it, but I accepted it because the north is my home.  It's part of me and I will never stop fighting for it, no matter the odds.  But the odds are against us.  None of you have seen the Army of the Dead.  None of you.  We can never hope to defeat them alone.  We need allies, powerful allies.  I know it's a risk.  But I have to take it."
28740,SANSA:  Then send an emissary.  Don't go yourself.
28741,JON:  Daenerys is a queen.  Only a king can convince her to help us.  It has to be me.
28742,SANSA:  You're abandoning your people.  Your abandoning your home.
28743,JON:  I'm leaving both in good hands.
28744,SANSA:  Whose?
28745,"JON:  Yours.  You are my sister.  You are the only Stark in Winterfell.  Until I return, the north is yours."
28746,NARRATOR:JON stands in the torchlit crypt looking at a statue of Ned Stark.  LORD BAELISH approaches him.
28747,BAELISH:  I delivered his bones myself.  I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister.  It seems like a lifetime ago.  Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him.
28748,NARRATOR:Baelish looks up at the statue of Ned Stark.
28749,"BAELISH:  I was sorry when he died.  Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much.  So did I.  She wasn't fond of you, was she?  Well, it appears she vastly underestimated you.  Your father and brothers are gone, yet here you stand King in the North.  Last best hope against the coming storm."
28750,NARRATOR:JON turns to face BAELISH.
28751,JON:  You don't belong down here.
28752,BAELISH:  Forgive me.  We have never talked properly.  I wanted to remedy that.
28753,JON:  I have nothing to say to you.
28754,"BAELISH:  Not even thank you?  If it weren't for me you'd have been slaughtered at that battlefield.  You have many enemies, My King, but I swear to you I'm not one of them.  I love Sansa as I loved her mother."
28755,NARRATOR:JON grabs BAELISH by the throat and pushes him against the wall.  BAELISH begins choking.
28756,JON:  Touch my sister and I'll kill you myself.
28757,NARRATOR:JON releases BAELISH.  JON turns and walks to exit the crypt.
28758,"NARRATOR:JON walks into the courtyard towards his horse.  SER DAVOS is seated on his own horse awaiting him.  JON climbs onto his horse and looks back.  He sees SANSA on the upper level of the courtyard.  JON waves goodbye and SANSA waves back.  JON, DAVOS and Winterfell guards ride out of the gate and exit the courtyard.

28770,"NARRATOR:ELLARIA SAND's daughters TYENE, OBARA, and NYMERIA are laying in hammocks next to each other having a conversation."
28771,NYMERIA:  You can't have them all.  It's not fair.
28772,OBARA:  I'm oldest.
28773,TYENE:  Momma will want Cersei for herself.
28774,OBARA:  She's not my momma.  You can have Cersei.  I want The Mountain.
28775,NYMERIA:  The Mountain killed father.  He'll crush you with one hand.
28776,TYENE: Father got careless.  That's what Momma says.
28777,"OBARA:  Will you shut up about Momma?  Momma, momma."
28778,NARRATOR:OBARA begins mocking TYENE.
28779,TYENE:  Maybe I'll kill you both before we take King's Landing and then I won't have to share.
28780,NARRATOR:OBARA and NYMERIA mock TYENE in unison.
28781,"NARRATOR:YARA GREYJOY, ELLARIA SAND are seated at a table drinking together.  THEON GREYJOY is standing next to them."
28782,"ELLARIA:  How can you drink this piss?  When we reach Sunspear I'll treat you to a Dornish red, the best in the world.  Have you ever been to Dorne?"
28783,YARA:  A few times.  Never stayed long.
28784,ELLARIA:   A boy in every port?
28785,"YARA:  A boy, a girl.  Depends on the port."
28786,ELLARIA:  Could we get some more?
28787,NARRATOR:ELLARIA hands her empty cup back to THEON.
28788,YARA:  I thought it wasn't for you.
28789,ELLARIA:  I'm developing a taste for it.
28790,NARRATOR:YARA looks at THEON
28791,YARA:  He's not your servant.
28792,THEON:  It's fine.
28793,NARRATOR:THEON begins filling the cup from a barrel of wine.
28794,"ELLARIA:  So, you're going to be Queen of the Iron Islands."
28795,YARA:  Once I kill my uncle.
28796,"ELLARIA:  And what will you be, handsome?"
28797,NARRATOR:ELLARIA stands and gropes THEON.
28798,THEON:  Whatever my queen demands.
28799,"YARA:  He'll be my advisor, my protector."
28800,"ELLARIA:  Oh, I see.  Your protector."
28801,NARRATOR:ELLARIA slowly walks towards YARA.
28802,ELLARIA:  So if someone gets too close to you --
28803,YARA:  He might have to intervene.
28804,YARA:  Until they've made their intentions known.
28805,"NARRATOR:ELLARIA sits next to YARA and spreads her legs apart, then looks at THEON."
28806,ELLARIA:  Why are you standing all the way over there then?  A foreign invasion is under way.  It seems like you don't need a protector.
28807,NARRATOR:A large crash is heard and the ship rocks back and forth.  YARA turns to ELLARIA.
28808,YARA:  Stay here.
28809,"NARRATOR:YARA stands, picks up her sword and rushes for the stairs to the upper deck.  THEON follows her."
28810,NARRATOR:YARA climbs onto the deck and sees mayhem.  There are flaming arrows and flares in the sky.  YARA turns to survey the madness.  A ship bearing the Greyjoy sigil comes sailing out of the smoke and fog directly at YARA's ship.
28811,YARA:  Euron.
28812,NARRATOR:EURON'S ship crashes into YARA's.  An armored gang plank is dropped onto YARA's ship.  Euron Greyjoy is riding on top of the plank as it crashes onto YARA's ship.  A sailor is crushed in the process.  Euron boards YARA's boat and begins cutting men down with an ax and laughing maniacally.  Dozens of men are rushing behind him to board YARA'S ship.  YARA and THEON both yell and leap into battle.  Many people are killed instantly.  More men are running over the gang plank.  TYENE SAND comes from below deck.  She throws a dagger and lodges it in an invader's eye.  She moves to the body to retrieve her knife.  YARA approaches her and kneels beside her.
28813,YARA:  Your mother is below deck.  Keep her safe.
28814,NARRATOR:TYENE nods in agreement.  She stands up and heads down into the captain's quarters.
28815,"NARRATOR:TYENE walks down the stairs and sees her mother, ELLARIA SAND.  TYENE runs to her mother and hugs her.  Immediately three men climb down the stairs and surround the women.  TYENE begins striking at the invaders with her knife."
28816,NARRATOR:THEON is fighting several men with his sword.  He cuts down two men and looks at YARA.  YARA looks around her at the scene.  Severel ships are engulfed in flames.  Flaming arrows are streaking in and men are shouting.  A flaming bolt flies through the air and hits YARA's mast causing it to burst into flames.  More men are rushing from EURON'S boat onto the deck.  YARA is slowly walking and watching the scene unfold.  She then turns and continues fighting.  EURON is cutting through men with ease.  He has just killed another when a whip lashes around his throat.  NYMERIA pulls on the whip and brings EURON towards her.  Euron turns and punches her in the face.  OBARA comes from behind EURON and stabs him in his arm.  He is knocked to the ground but quickly regains his feet.  They continue fighting
28817,NARRATOR:TYENE is still fighting the men.  She slices one man and stabs another in the testicles.
28818,"NARRATOR:OBARA attempts to attack EURON again.  He blocks her attack and disarms her spear.  EURON grabs her by the throat and headbutts her then pushes her to her knees.  He rams her spear through her stomach and lifts her off the ground.  NYMERIA turns and sees her sister and screams, running at EURON.  She whips him several times but EURON graps the end of the whip and pulls NYMERIA towards him.  She is attacking with a knife.  EURON punches her and knocks her down.  EURON then takes NYMERIA'S whip and wraps it around her throat choking her."
28819,NARRATOR:TYENE is now getting overpowered by the men.  They punch her and grab her from behind.  One of the men walks to ELLARIA and grabs her.
28820,ELLARIA:  Kill us!  Get it over with!
28821,NARRATOR:The man in charge smirks at ELLARIA and shakes his head.  The men begin to push ELLARIA and TYENE upstairs to take them as hostages.

28825,EURON:  Theon!
28826,NARRATOR:THEON is still fighting.  He hears his uncle's yell and turns to look.  EURON is holding YARA and has his ax to her neck.  THEON stops and is frozen in place.  EURON begins smirking at him.
28827,"EURON:  Ah, come on your cockless hound.  I have her.  Come and get her."
28828,"NARRATOR:THEON is looking around.  Men are being killed and everything is on fire.  One invader is pulling someone's teeth out.  THEON begins to shake and whimper.  His eye twitches.  He turns, drops his sword and jumps off of the rail of the ship into the water.  EURON begins to laugh and look at YARA."
28829,CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE
28830,NARRATOR:THEON is in the water holding onto some flotsam.  He is watching the ships burn and the Iron Fleet sail away into the distance.
28831,NARRATOR:END CREDITS
28832,TYRION:  The bastard of Winterfell.
28833,JON:  The dwarf of Casterly Rock.
28834,"NARRATOR:TYRION and JON both stare at each for a moment, then break into a smile.  They step forward and shake hands."
28835,TYRION:  I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall.
28836,"JON:  You were pissing off the edge, if I remember right.  You picked up some scars along the road."
28837,NARRATOR:TYRION nods his head in agreement.
28838,TYRION:  It's been a long road.  But we're both still here.
28839,NARRATOR:TYRION turns to address DAVOS.
28840,TYRION:  I'm Tyrion Lannister.
28841,DAVOS:  Davos Seaworth.
28842,NARRATOR:TYRION and DAVOS shake hands.
28843,"TYRION:  Ah, the Onion Knight.  We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay."
28844,DAVOS:  Unluckily for me.
28845,TYRION:  Missandei is the queen's most trusted advisor.
28846,MISSANDEI:  Welcome to Dragonstone.  Our queen knows this is a long journey.  She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf.  If you wouldn't mind handing over your weapons.
28847,NARRATOR:JON looks at DAVOS and his men.
28848,JON:  Of course.
28849,NARRATOR:The Dothraki guard move to take the weapons.  JON unties his sword and hands it over.  The Dothraki pick up JON's boat and begin to carry it away.
28850,"MISSANDEI:  Please, this way."
28851,NARRATOR:DAVOS begins walking with MISSANDEI and TYRION.  JON is following a few steps behind.
28852,DAVOS:  Where are you from?  I can't place the accent.
28853,MISSANDEI:  I was born on the Island of Naarth.
28854,DAVOS:  Ah.  I hear it's beautiful down there.  Palm trees and butterflies.  I haven't been myself.
28855,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI nods and DAVOS slows pace to talk with JON.
28856,DAVOS:  This place has changed.
28857,NARRATOR:The group are making their way up to Dragonstone along a narrow stone pathway built into the cliffs leading to the castle.  TYRION begins speaking to JON.
28858,"TYRION:  And Sansa, I hear she's alive and well."
28859,JON:  She is.
28860,TYRION:  Does she miss me terribly?
28861,NARRATOR:JON looks at TYRION and doesn't say anything.
28862,TYRION:  A sham marriage and unconsummated.
28863,JON:  I didn't ask --
28864,"TYRION:  Well, it was.  It wasn't.  Anyway, she's much smarter than she lets on."
28865,JON:  She's starting to let on.
28866,TYRION:  Good.  At some point I want to hear how a Knight's Watch recruit became King in the North.
28867,JON:  As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen.
28868,"TYRION:  A long and bloody tale.  To be honest, I was drunk for most of it."
28869,JON:  My bannermen think I'm a fool for coming here.
28870,"TYRION:  Of course they do.  If I was your hand I would have advised against it.  General rule of thumb, Stark men don't fare well when they travel south."
28871,JON:  True.  But I'm not a Stark.
28872,"NARRATOR:A loud roar is heard from overhead.  JON and DAVOS dive to the ground.  Drogon flies over them, turns and flies over the castle.  JON and DAVOS look at each other in astonishment.  DAVOS looks back to MISSANDEI who is still standing and smirking.  Tyrion walks over and helps JON up to his feet."
28873,"TYRION:  I'd say you get used to them, but you never really do."
28874,NARRATOR:JON looks back to the sky.  All three dragons are circling above the castle.
28875,TYRION:  Come.  Their mother is waiting for you.
28876,NARRATOR:JON and DAVOS exchange glances.  They continue walking up the path.  The camera shifts focus to MELISANDRE who is far above the group watching them from a cliff.  VARYS approaches MELISANDRE from behind and stands next to her.
28877,VARYS:  I wondered why you weren't there to meet our guests.  You begged us to summon the King in the North.  Don't you want to see him again?
28878,MELISANDRE:  I've done my part.  I've brought ice and fire together.
28879,VARYS:  Strange.  You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff.  I didn't take you for a bashful girl.
28880,MELISANDRE:  My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end.
28881,"VARYS:  Oh, I doubt that.  Give us common folk one taste of power we're like the lion who tasted man.  Nothing is ever so sweet again."
28882,"MELISANDRE:  Neither of us is common folk anymore.  I did not part on good terms with the King in the North, or his advisor."
28883,VARYS:  Why?
28884,MELISANDRE:  Because of mistakes I made.  Terrible mistakes.  I would only be a distraction if I stayed.
28885,VARYS:  So where will you go?
28886,MELISANDRE:  Volantis.
28887,"VARYS:  Good.  If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros.  I'm not sure you'd be safe here."
28888,"MELISANDRE:  I will return, dear spider.  One last time."
28889,NARRATOR:VARYS begins shaking his head.
28890,VARYS:  My Lady --
28891,"MELISANDRE:  I have to die in this strange country, just like you."
28892,NARRATOR:MELISANDRE turns and walks away leaving VARYS alone on the cliff.
28893,"NARRATOR:JON approaches the throne room.  Dothraki guards open the doors and allow him in.  He is walking with TYRION, MISSANDEI, DAVOS and other Dothraki guards.  DAENERYS is sitting on the throne.  MISSANDEI begins addressing JON and DAVOS."
28894,"MISSANDEI:  You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen, rightful heir to the Iron Throne, rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men, Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, The Unburnt, The Breaker of Chains."
28895,NARRATOR:JON turns and looks at DAVOS.
28896,DAVOS:  This is Jon Snow.
28897,NARRATOR:DAVOS nods and pauses.
28898,DAVOS:  He's King in the North.
28899,NARRATOR:TYRION smirks to himself.
28900,"DAENERYS:  Thank you for traveling so far, My Lords.  I hope the seas weren't too rough."
28901,"JON:  The winds were kind, Your Grace."
28902,"DAVOS:  Apologies.  I have a Flea Bottom accent, I know.  But Jon Snow is King in the North, Your Grace.  He's not a lord."
28903,DAENERYS:  Forgive me --
28904,"TYRION:  Your Grace, this is Ser Davos Seaworth."
28905,"DAERNEYS:  Forgive me, Ser Davos.  I never did receive a formal education, but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen.  Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity.  But do I have my facts wrong?"
28906,"DAVOS:  I wasn't there, Your Grace."
28907,TYRION:  Forever.
28908,"DAENERYS:  Forever.  So I assume, My Lord, that you're here to bend the knee."
28909,JON:  I am not.
28910,"DAENERYS:  Oh.  Well, that is unfortunate.  You've travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen?"
28911,JON:  Break faith?  Your father burned my grandfather alive.  He burned my uncle alive.  He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms.
28912,"DAENERYS:  My father was an evil man.  On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family.  And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father.  Our two houses were allies for centuries.  Those were the best centuries the kingdom's ever known.  Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.  I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.  Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.  Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.  Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it."
28913,JON:  You're right.  You're not guilty of your father's crime.  And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.
28914,DAENERYS:  Then why are you here?
28915,JON:  Because I need your help and you need mine.
28916,NARRATOR:DAENERYS smirks and looks over at TYRION.  She starts speaking to JON again.
28917,DAENERYS:  Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?
28918,JON:  I did.
28919,"DAENERYS:  And did you see the Dothraki, all of whom have sworn to kill for me?"
28920,JON:  They're hard to miss.
28921,"DAENERYS:  But still, I need your help?"
28922,"DAVOS:  Not to defeat Cersei.  You could storm King's Landing tomorrow and the city would fall.  Hell, we almost took it and we didn't even have dragons."
28923,TYRION:  Almost.
28924,JON:  But you haven't stormed King's Landing.  Why not?  The only reason I can see is you don't want to kill thousands of innocent people.  It's the fastest way to win the war but you won't do it.  Which means at the very least you're better than Cersei.
28925,"DAENERYS:  Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help."
28926,"JON:  Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game screaming that the rules aren't fair."
28927,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to TYRION.
28928,DAENERYS:  You told me you liked this man.
28929,TYRION:  I do.
28930,"DAENERYS:  In the time since he's met me he's refused to call me queen, he's refused to bow and now he's calling me a child."
28931,TYRION:  I believe he's calling all of us children.  Figure of speech.
28932,"JON:  Your Grace, everone you know will die before winter is over if we don't defeat the enemy to the north."
28933,"DAENERYS:  As far as I can see, you are the enemy to the north."
28934,JON:  I am not your enemy.  The dead are the enemy.
28935,NARRATOR:DAENERYS pauses and is incredulous.
28936,DAENERYS:  The dead?
28937,NARRATOR:DAENERYS addresses TYRION.
28938,DAENERYS:  Is that another figure of speech?
28939,NARRATOR:JON answers her before Tyrion.
28940,JON:  The Army of the Dead is on the march.
28941,TYRION:  The Army of the Dead?
28942,"JON:  You don't know me well, My Lord, but do you think I am a liar or a madman?"
28943,"TYRION:  No, I don't think you're either of those things."
28944,JON:  The Army of the Dead is real.  The White Walkers are real.  The Knight King is real.  I've seen them.  If they get past the wall and we're squabbling amongst ourselves --
28945,NARRATOR:JON begins walking closer to the throne.  The Dothraki guards step towards him to halt him.
28946,NARRATOR:DAENERYS pauses a moment.
28947,DAENERYS:  I was born at Dragonstone.  Not that I can remember it.
28948,NARRATOR:DAENERYS stands from the throne and begins walking down the stairs towards JON.
28949,"DAENERYS:  We fled before Robert's assassins could find us.  Robert was your father's best friend, no?  I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib.  Not that it matters now of course.  I spent my life in foreign lands.  So many men have tried to kill me.  I don't remember all of their names.  I have been sold like a brood mare.  I have been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.  Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?  Faith.  Not in any gods.  Not in myths and legends.  In myself.  In Daenerys Targaryen.  The world hadn't seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born.  The Dothraki hadn't crossed the sea.  Any sea."
28950,NARRATOR:DAENERYS stops walking and is face to face with JON.
28951,DAENERYS:  They did for me.  I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.  And I will.
28952,JON:  You'll be ruling over a graveyard if we don't defeat the Night King.
28953,NARRATOR:Tyrion steps up to stand next to DAENERYS and speaks to JON.
28954,TYRION:  The war against my sister has already begun.  You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting --
28955,NARRATOR:TYRION pauses a moment.
28956,DAVOS:  You don't believe him.  I understand that.  It sounds like nonsense.
28957,NARRATOR:JON nods in agreement.
28958,"DAVOS:  But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.  You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros.  He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen.  He was named Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.  He was named King in the North.  Not because of his birthright.  He has no birthright.  He's a damn bastard.  All those hard son's of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him."
28959,NARRATOR:DAENERYS stops looking at DAVOS and begins looking at JON.
28960,"DAVOS:  All those things you don't believe in, he faced those things.  He fought those things for the good of his people.  He risked his life for his people.  He took a knife in the heart for his people.  He gave his own --"
28961,NARRATOR:JON looks at DAVOS to cut him off.  DAVOS stops talking.  DAENERYS and TYRION exchange glances.
28962,DAVOS:  If we don't put asside our enmities and band together we will die.  And then it doesn't matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne.
28963,TYRION:  If it doesn't matter you might as well kneel.
28964,NARRATOR:JON shakes his head and looks at the floor.
28965,TYRION:  Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys.  Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north.
28966,JON:  There's no time for that.  There's no time for any of this.  While we stand here debating --
28967,TYRION:  It takes no time to bend the knee.  Pledge your sword to her cause.
28968,JON:  And why would I do that?
28969,NARRATOR:JON turns to speak to DAENERYS.
28970,"JON:  I mean no offense, Your Grace, but I don't know you.  As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your father's name.  And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King.  The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them.  And I will continue to do so as well as I can."
28971,"DAENERYS:  That's fair.  It's also fair to point out that I'm the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom, you are in open rebellion."
28972,NARRATOR:VARYS walks quickly into the throne room and approaches DAENERYS.  He begins whispering in her ear.
28973,DAENERYS:  You must forgive my manners.  You will both be tired after your long journey.  We'll have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms.
28974,NARRATOR:DAENERYS begins speaking Valyrian to her Queensguard.  Her guard steps forward to escort JON and DAVOS.  JON speaks to DAENERYS.
28975,JON:  Am I your prisoner?
28976,DAENERYS:  Not yet.
28977,NARRATOR:DAENERYS begins walking back to the throne.  JON and DAVOS exit the throne room with a member of the Queensguard.  The Dothraki close the door to the throne room after JON and DAVOS exit.  VARYS begins speaking to DAENERYS.
28978,VARYS:  Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne.
28979,DAENERYS:  And?
28980,VARYS:  Two or three ships escaped.  The rest sunk our captured.  Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured.  The Greyjoys are dead or captured.
28981,DAENERYS:  All of them?
28982,CUT TO:  SEA OF DORNE
28983,NARRATOR:Theon is hanging on to flotsam on the ocean.  A friendly Greyjoy ship is pulling him out of the water with a rope.  They haul him onto the ship and drop him on deck.  He is shivering and dishelveled.  The captain of the boat approaches THEON and speaks to him while THEON is laying on the deck.
28984,CAPTAIN:  Your sister's dead?
28985,THEON:  Euron has her.
28986,CAPTAIN:  You saw him take her?  And you got away?
28987,THEON:  I couldn't save her.  I tried.
28988,CAPTAIN:  You wouldn't be here if you tried.
28989,"NARRATOR:THEON turns his eyes away from the captain.  The captain turns and walks away.  The men go back to their duties, some stepping over THEON as he continues to lay on the deck."
28990,"NARRATOR:EURON is escorting prisoners YARA GREYJOY, ELLARIA and TYENE SAND.  The prisoners are chained.  EURON is riding a horse.  He has a rope tied to YARA's neck and is leading her towards the Red Keep.  There is a large crowd shouting and cheering as they bring the prisoners through the streets.  EURON is smiling and showing off for the crowd.  The crowd shouts obscenities and curses at the prisoners."
28991,EURON(to YARA):  This is the life.  Look at them.  Cheering for a Greyjoy.
28992,NARRATOR:EURON pulls on the rope around YARA's neck forcing her to run forward to stand next to EURON's horse.
28993,"EURON:  I have to be honest, it's making me hard.  Did you see little Theon's face right before he jumped overboard?"
28994,NARRATOR:EURON begins mocking Theon in a high pitched voice.
28995,EURON:  Oh no!
28996,NARRATOR:EURON laughs.
28997,EURON:  What a twat.
28998,"NARRATOR:CERSEI is sitting on the throne surrounded by QYBURN, JAIME, and THE MOUNTAIN.  There is a crowd gathered and they're clapping as EURON brings the prisoners down the aisle towards the throne.  EURON climbs down from his horse and grabs the chains that bind ELLARIA and TYENE and starts walking them to the throne."
28999,EURON:  My queen.  Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands.
29000,NARRATOR:EURON throws the chains at the feet of CERSEI.
29001,EURON:  I give you --
29002,NARRATOR:EURON looks over to JAIME.
29003,NARRATOR:ELLARIA spits onto the floor near the throne and CERSEI smiles.  CERSEI begins speaking to EURON.
29004,CERSEI:  You've proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown.
29005,NARRATOR:EURON leans in and speaks to CERSEI so the crowd can't hear.
29006,EURON:  A bit more than a true friend.
29007,CERSEI:  And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism.
29008,EURON:  There's only one reward I want.
29009,CERSEI:  You shall have what your heart desires --
29010,NARRATOR:JAIME looks over at CERSEI.
29011,NARRATOR:CERSEI stands and addresses the people gathered in the throne room.
29012,"CERSEI:  With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies, the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country."
29013,NARRATOR:The crowd starts cheering and clapping.  CERSEI turns and walks back to the throne and sits.  EURON is waving to the crowd and begins speaking to JAIME.
29014,"EURON:  There's nothing quite like it, is there?  The love of the people.  I suppose you wouldn't know."
29015,"JAIME:  This same mob spat at my sister not long ago, and if you turn on us, they'll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike."
29016,"EURON:  Or yours.  They just like severed heads really.  Listen, if you have any advice at all I'd love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers."
29017,JAIME:  Advice?
29018,EURON:  Does she like it gentle or rough?  A finger in the bum?
29019,NARRATOR:JAIME turns to EURON angrily.
29020,"EURON:  Shhh, shhh, shhh, not now.  We'll talk later."
29021,NARRATOR:EURON bows to the queen.  He walks down and collects YARA and walks out with her and his guards.
29022,"NARRATOR:THE MOUNTAIN, CERSEI and QYBURN are standing in a torch lit dungeon beneath the Red Keep.  ELLARIA and TYENE are chained to walls opposite of each other.  They are both gagged.  CERSEI speaks to ELLARIA."
29023,"CERSEI:  I want you to know I understand.  Even though we're enemies, you and I, I understand the fear that drives you.  I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lover's head.  I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyn's skull breaking."
29024,NARRATOR:ELLARIA struggles against her restraints
29025,"CERSEI:  The sound of your scream.  I never heard a sound like that.  I thought, that's true love.  Oberyn looked beautiful that day.  He really did.  No one moved like him.  No one had such skill with a spear.  Even Ser Gregor couldn't stop him.  If only he hadn't taunted him.  He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die.  But that wasn't your lover's way, was it?  Now he's burried somewhere.  And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever.  That must be difficult for you.  When my daughter was taken from me, my only daughter, well, you can't imagine how that feels unless you've lost a child.  I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse.  I couldn't bear to see her in another woman's arms.  I never got to have a mother.  But Myrcella did.  She was mine and you took her from me.  Why did you do that?"
29026,NARRATOR:CERSEI pauses and looks at ELLARIA.
29027,CERSEI:  It doesn't matter now.
29028,NARRATOR:CERSEI walks across the room and stands next to TYENE looking at her but continues speaking to ELLARIA.
29029,"CERSEI:  Your daughter is a beauty too.  Brown eyes, those lips.  A perfect Dornish beauty."
29030,"NARRATOR:TYENE is looking from CERSEI to her mother, ELLARIA.  CERSAI stops looking at TYENE and turns back to ELLARIA."
29031,CERSEI:  I imagine she is your favorite.
29032,NARRATOR:ELLARIA pulls on her restraints.
29033,"CERSEI:  I know, I know, we're not supposed to have favorites.  But still, we're only human.  We love who we love."
29034,NARRATOR:ELLARIA begins gasping and trying to speak through her gag.
29035,CERSEI:  I'm sorry.  I can't understand you.  The gag makes it difficult to understand what you're saying.  It must be frustrating.
29036,NARRATOR:ELLARIA whimpers.
29037,CERSEI:  We all make our choices.  You chose to murder my daughter.  You must have felt powerful after you made that choice.
29038,NARRATOR:ELLARIA screams and pulls against her restraints.  She takes the slack out of the chain but is held in place inches from CERSEI.
29039,"CERSEI:  Do you feel powerful now?  I don't sleep very well, not at all really.  I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies.  How to destroy Ellaria Sand, the woman who murdered my only daughter.  I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyn's.  It would be poetic I suppose but fast.  Too fast."
29040,NARRATOR:CERSEI turns away from ELLARIA and walks back to TYENE and takes TYENE's face in her hands.  She continues talking to ELLARIA.
29041,CERSEI:  I thought about having him crush your daughter's skull.
29042,NARRATOR:CERSEI removes the gag from TYENE's mouth.
29043,"CERSEI:  She's so beautiful.  The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg, no, it's just not right."
29044,"NARRATOR:CERSEI is caressing TYENE's face.  CERSEI looks at ELLARIA, then turns back and kisses TYENE.  TYENE is whimpering.  CERSEI stops kissing TYENE and looks back at ELLARIA."
29045,TYENE:  Momma!
29046,NARRATOR:ELLARIA screams and looks at CERSEI.  QYBURN steps to TYENE and puts the gag back on her mouth.  TYENE is crying.  QYBURN walks over to CERSEI and hands her a cloth.  ELLARIA falls down to her knees and is watching her daughter.  CERSEI starts wiping off the red lipstick she was wearing.  CERSEI speaks to ELLARIA.
29047,"CERSEI:  Qyburn, he's the cleverest man I know.  Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella.  The long goodbye, was that it?"
29048,QYBURN:  The Long Farewell.
29049,NARRATOR:QYBURN hands CERSEI a vile containing the posion antidote.
29050,CERSEI:  That's the one.
29051,NARRATOR:CERSEI drinks the antidote.
29052,CERSEI:  How long does the poison take?
29053,"QYBURN:  Difficult to say.  Hours, days, it depends on the subject's constitution."
29054,CERSEI:  But death is certain?
29055,"QYBURN:  Oh yes, Your Grace, quite certain."
29056,NARRATOR:ELLARIA is still on her knees crying.  CERSEI squats down to talk to her.
29057,"CERSEI:  Your daughter will die here in this cell.  You will be here watching when she does.  You will be here the rest of your days.  If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat.  You will live to watch your daughter rot, to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices you've made."
29058,NARRATOR:CERSEI continues looking at ELLARIA but speaks to QYBURN.
29059,CERSEI:  Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours.  I don't want her to miss a thing.
29060,NARRATOR:CERSEI stands and walks out of the chamber with her entourage.  TYENE and ELLARIA both strain against their chains but can't reach each other.
29061,NARRATOR:JAIME sets his gold hand down on the table and pours himself a glass of wine.  CERSEI barges in and approaches him.  CERSEI starts kissing JAIME.
29062,JAIME:  No.
29063,NARRATOR:CERSEI kisses JAIME.  JAIME stands.  CERSEI unties his pants and gets on her knees.  Sex scene ensues.  Some time has passed.  CERSEI is asleep and JAIME is watching her in bed.  There's a knock at the door.
29064,JAIME:  Don't.
29065,"NARRATOR:CERSEI kisses JAIME, gets out of bed and covers herself with a robe.  JAIME sits up concerned."
29066,JAIME:  What are you doing?  No one can see us like this ?
29067,CERSEI:  I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms.  I'll do as I please.
29068,NARRATOR:CERSEI walks over and opens the door.  A messenger looks in and sees JAIME in the bed.
29069,"MESSENGER:  Forgive me, Your Grace.  The visitor from Braavos has arrived."
29070,CERSEI:  Good.  And we'll need fresh sheets for the bed.
29071,"MESSENGER:  At once, Your Grace."
29072,NARRATOR:CERSEI closes the door.  JAIME lays his head against his pillows and laughs nervously.
29073,NARRATOR:CERSEI is pouring two glasses of wine.  She carries them over and offers one to TYCHO NESTORIS of the Iron Bank.
29074,"TYCHO:  No, thank you."
29075,NARRATOR:CERSEI carries both glasses to her desk and sits down.
29076,"TYCHO:  My condolences, Your Grace, on the death of your son.  From all reports he was a fine young man."
29077,CERSEI:  The Iron Bank didn't send you hear to offer condolences.
29078,TYCHO:  Condolences and congratulations.  You've become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms.  That's quite an accomplishment.  The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law.
29079,CERSEI:  The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident.
29080,TYCHO:  Indeed.  But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership.
29081,CERSEI:  The Iron Bank wants its gold back.
29082,"TYCHO:  Your father never minced words either.  But, yes, your debts are considerable.  And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts.  We both know how expensive war can be."
29083,CERSEI:  And we both know gold wins wars.  Your vaults are empty.  Your late husband's profligacy saw to that.
29084,TYCHO:  Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies.  You're surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne.
29085,CERSEI:  And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner.
29086,TYCHO:  We don't make bets.  We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful.
29087,CERSEI:  That's a fancy way of saying bet.  The war has already begun.  I've drawn first blood.  I decapitated the Dornish snake.  My armada owns the Narrow Sea.
29088,TYCHO:  Euron Greyjoy's armada owns the Narrow Sea.
29089,CERSEI:  Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me.
29090,TYCHO:  For now.  Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons.  How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons?
29091,"CERSEI:  Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think.  Now, let's talk about the Targaryen girl.  You want to invest in her?  I'm guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade.  How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves?"
29092,"TYCHO:  The slave trade has entered a down turn, it's true."
29093,CERSEI:  From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch.  In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries?
29094,NARRATOR:TYCHO begins to speak but CERSEI cuts him off.
29095,CERSEI:  The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts.  Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons?
29096,TYCHO:  Your father's daughter indeed.
29097,CERSEI:  Give me a fortnight.  Stay in King's Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full.
29098,NARRATOR:TYRION is walking along the cliffs and sees JON standing alone looking out into the ocean.  TYRION approaches JON and speaks to him.
29099,TYRION:  I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack.  You're making it difficult.  You look a lot better brooding than I do.  You make me feel like I'm failing at brooding over failing.
29100,JON:  I'm a prisoner on this island.
29101,"TYRION:  I wouldn't say you're a prisoner on this island.  You're free to walk the castle, the beaches, to go wherever you want."
29102,JON:  Except to my ship.  They took my ship.
29103,TYRION:  I wouldn't say we took your ship.
29104,JON:  I'm not playing word games with you.  The dead are coming for us all.
29105,"TYRION:  Why don't you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies, and I'll figure out what to do about your walking dead men."
29106,JON:  It's hard for me to fathom.  It really is.  If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King --
29107,NARRATOR:JON pauses and hangs his head.
29108,JON:  You probably don't believe me.
29109,TYRION:  I do actually.
29110,JON:  You didn't before.  Grumpkins and snarks you called them.  Do you remember?  You said it was all nonsense.
29111,"TYRION:  It was all nonsense.  Everybody knew it.  But then Mormont saw them and you saw them, and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows."
29112,JON:  How do I convince people who don't know me that an enemey they don't believe in is coming to kill them all?
29113,TYRION:  Good question.
29114,JON:  I know it's a good question.  I'm looking for an answer.
29115,"TYRION:  People's minds aren't made for problems that large.  White Walkers, the Night King, Army of the Dead, it's almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister."
29116,JON:  I need to help prepare my people for what's coming.  I can't help them from here.  I'd like to leave.
29117,TYRION:  It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily.
29118,"JON:  Everyone told me to learn from my father's mistakes.  Don't go south.  Don't answer a summons from the Mad King's daughter, a foreign invader.  And here I am.  A northern fool."
29119,"TYRION:  Children are not their fathers, luckily for all of us.  And sometimes there's more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye.  Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didn't.  Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now.  While you're our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad King's daughter.  She protects people from monsters, just as you do.  That's why she came here.  And she's not about to head north to fight an enemy she's never seen on a word of a man she doesn't know after a single meeting.  That's not a reasonable thing to ask."
29120,NARRATOR:JON turns from TYRION and begins to walk away.
29121,TYRION:  So do you have anything reasonable to ask?
29122,NARRATOR:JON stops and turns back around.
29123,JON:  What do you mean?
29124,TYRION:  Maybe you are a northern fool.  I'm asking if there's something I can do to help you.
29125,NARRATOR:DAENERYS and TYRION are having a discussion.
29126,DAENERYS:  Dragonglass?
29127,"TYRION:  Yes.  Volcanic glass, obsidian.  He says you have a tremendous amount of it here."
29128,DAENERYS:  Why are we talking about glass?  We just lost two of our allies.
29129,"TYRION:  Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow, a potential ally."
29130,DAENERYS:  And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass?
29131,"TYRION:  Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers, or stop them, destroy them.  I'm unsure of the nomenclature."
29132,DAENERYS:  And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings?
29133,"TYRION:  I'd very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong, but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it."
29134,DAENERYS:  Which wise man said this?
29135,TYRION:  I don't remember.
29136,DAENERYS:  Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?
29137,"TYRION:  I would never do that...to you.  The reason I believe Jon Snow is because he's here.  All of his advisors would have told him not to come.  I would have told him not to come, yet he's here anyway.  You don't have to believe him.  Let him mine the Dragonglass.  If he's wrong it's worthless.  You didn't even know it was here.  It's nothing to you.  Give him something by giving him nothing.  Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally.  Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand.  Casterly Rock."
29138,DAENERYS:  What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people?  Did you notice that?
29139,TYRION:  You must allow them their flights of fancy.  It's dreary in the north.
29140,NARRATOR:DAENERYS is at the bottom of the path looking out into the ocean.  Dragons are flying over the ocean and over the mountains in the distance.  JON approaches DAENERYS from the top of the stairs.
29141,JON:  Amazing thing to see.
29142,DAENERYS:  I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon. They're both gone now.
29143,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to look at JON.
29144,DAENERYS:  You lost two brothers as well?
29145,NARRATOR:JON shakes his head.
29146,DAENERYS:  People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are.  Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know.
29147,JON:  You've been talking to Tyrion?
29148,DAENERYS:  He is my Hand.
29149,JON:  He enjoys talking.
29150,DAENERYS:  We all enjoy what we're good at.
29151,JON:  I don't.
29152,NARRATOR:DAENERYS pauses and looks at JON.
29153,DAENERYS:  You know I'm not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne.
29154,JON:  I never expected that you would.
29155,DAENERYS:  And I haven't changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne.
29156,JON:  I haven't either.
29157,DAENERYS:  I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it.  Any resources or men you need I will provide for you.
29158,JON:  Thank you.
29159,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns back to the ocean.
29160,JON:  So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead?
29161,"DAENERYS:  You better get to work, Jon Snow."
29162,NARRATOR:JON turns and quickly walks up the stairs towards the castly.
29163,"NARRATOR:Men are working in the courtyard rolling carts of hey and carrying water.  A blacksmith is working the forge.  SANSA, PETER BAELISH, YOHN ROYCE and MAESTER WOLKAN are standing on the upper level of the courtyard having a discussion."
29164,SANSA:  How much do we have?
29165,"WOLKAN:  4,000 bushels, My Lady."
29166,SANSA:  What does that mean?
29167,"YOHN:  For the current occupants of the castle it's enough food for a year, perhaps more."
29168,NARRATOR:SANSA begins walking and everyone follows.
29169,SANSA:  What's the longest winter in the past 100 years?
29170,WOLKAN:  I'm not entirely certain.  I'll check Maester Llewyn's records.  He kept a copy of every raven scroll.
29171,NARRATOR:SANSA and the men walk from the upper level down into the courtyard.
29172,"SANSA:  You're telling me we don't have enough food, especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell."
29173,"WOLKAN:  No, My Lady, most likely not."
29174,"SANSA:  We must prepare for that eventuality.  Every direction the threat comes from, this is the best place to be.  We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north.  If we don't use it by winter's end we'll give it back to them, but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there won't be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them."
29175,"YOHN:  Very wise, My Lady."
29176,"SANSA:  Maester Wolkan, you'll see to it?"
29177,NARRATOR:WOLKAN bows and leaves.  SANSA and the others keep walking through the courtyard.  SANSA sees smiths hammering breastplate.
29178,SANSA:  Are they covering those breastplates in leather?
29179,"YOHN:  No, My Lady."
29180,"SANSA:  Well, shouldn't they be once the real cold comes?"
29181,"YOHN:  They should indeed.  Pardon me, My Lady."
29182,NARRATOR:YOHN steps over to the blacksmith.
29183,"YOHN:  You there, why isn't there leather on these?"
29184,NARRATOR:SANSA and BAELISH continue walking.
29185,BAELISH:  Command suits you.  The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall.
29186,SANSA:  So they should be.
29187,BAELISH:  I know Cersei better than anyone here.  If you turn your back on her --
29188,SANSA:  You don't know Cersei better than anyone here.
29189,BAELISH:  I only meant to say --
29190,"SANSA:  That the woman who murdered my mother, father and brother is dangerous?  Thank you for your wise council."
29191,"BAELISH:  One of two things will happen.  Either the dead will defeat the living, in which case all our troubles come to an end.  Or life will win out.  And what then?"
29192,NARRATOR:BAELISH walks in front of SANSA and stops her.
29193,"BAELISH:  Don't fight in the north or the south.  Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind.  Everyone is your enemy, everyone is your friend, every possible series of events is happening all at once.  Live that way and nothing will surprise you.  Everything that happens will be something that you've seen before."
29194,NARRATOR:A Winterfell guard approaches SANSA and BAELISH.
29195,"GUARD:  Lady Sansa, at the gate."
29196,NARRATOR:SANSA turns and walks away from BAELISH.  There is a commotion at the gate.  People are gathered around.  SANSA rushes over to see what's going on.  Bran is in a cart in the Winterfell courtyard.  Bran looks at SANSA for a few moments without saying anything.
29197,"BRAN:  Hello, Sansa."
29198,NARRATOR:SANSA begins to cry and hugs BRAN.
29199,NARRATOR:SANSA and BRAN are sitting next to the Weirwood Tree having a discussion.
29200,SANSA:  I wish Jon was here.
29201,BRAN:  Yes.  I need to speak to him.
29202,SANSA:  Your father's last living true born son.  You're Lord of Winterfell.
29203,BRAN:  I can never be the Lord of Winterfell.  I can never be lord of anything.  I'm the three-eyed raven.
29204,SANSA:  I don't know what that means.
29205,BRAN:  It's difficult to explain.
29206,"SANSA:  Try, please, for me."
29207,"BRAN:  It means I can see everything.  Everything that's ever happened to everyone.  Everything that's happening right now.  It's all pieces, fragments.  I need to learn to see better.  When the long night comes again I need to be ready."
29208,SANSA:  How do you know all of this?
29209,BRAN:  The three-eyed raven taught me.
29210,SANSA:  I thought you were the three-eyed raven.
29211,BRAN:  I told you it's difficult to explain.
29212,SANSA:  Bran --
29213,BRAN:  I'm sorry for all that's happened to you.  I'm sorry it had to happen here at our home.  It was so beautiful that night.  Snow falling just like now.  And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress.
29214,NARRATOR:SANSA appears shaken.  She quickly stands up to leave.
29215,"SANSA:  I have to go back inside, Bran."
29216,BRAN:  I'll stay a bit longer.
29217,"NARRATOR:ARCHMAESTER MARWYN, SAMWELL TARLEY and JORAH MORMONT are standing in JORAH's quarantine room.  JORAH's skin has scars over the surface and the Greyscale is completely gone.  MARWYN extends a medical tool and begins poking around to examine JORAH."
29218,MARWYN:  Hmm.
29219,NARRATOR:MARWYN walks around JORAH and continues to exam him.
29220,MARWYN:  Hmm.  Does it hurt?
29221,JORAH:  A bit.  Less than before.
29222,MARWYN:  The infection no longer appears to be active.
29223,NARRATOR:JORAH sighs with relief and looks at the floor.
29224,MARWYN:  Unusual.  Unlikely.  One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment.
29225,JORAH:  I don't know anything about that.  I just started feeling better.  I assumed it was the rest that did it.
29226,NARRATOR:SAMWELL begins nodding his head in agreement.
29227,JORAH:  And the climate.
29228,"MARWYN:  The climate?  You're free to go, Ser.  This chamber is needed for the infectious, which you are no longer."
29229,NARRATOR:MARWYN begins walking out of the room.
29230,"MARWYN:  Tarley, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening."
29231,NARRATOR:JORAH and SAMWELL stay in the room and have a discussion.
29232,JORAH:  How bad is it?
29233,SAMWELL:  I suppose I'll find out this evening.
29234,NARRATOR:JORAH smiles and nods at SAMWELL.   He turns around and picks up his shirt.
29235,SAMWELL:  Where will you go?
29236,NARRATOR:JORAH puts on his shirt and begins tying it up.
29237,JORAH:  I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.  I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.  Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.  The only place for me is with her.
29238,NARRATOR:JORAH turns to face SAMWELL.
29239,JORAH:  I owe my life to her and you.
29240,SAMWELL:  Your father saved me more than once.  It's the least I could do.
29241,NARRATOR:JORAH nods his head.
29242,JORAH:  Perhaps our paths will cross again?
29243,SAMWELL:  I hope they do.
29244,"NARRATOR:SAMWELL reaches out to shake JORAH's hand.  JORAH hesitates for a moment, then takes SAMWELL's hand.  JORAH places his second hand over SAMWELL's.  SAMWELL turns and walks out of the room leaving JORAH alone.  JORAH looks out the window and smiles."
29245,CUT TO:  ARCHMAESTER'S STUDY
29246,NARRATOR:MARWYN AND SAMWELL are having a discussion.
29247,MARWYN:  You treated him?
29248,SAMWELL:  Yes.
29249,MARWYN:  Who told you to treat him?
29250,SAMWELL:  No one.
29251,MARWYN:  Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him?
29252,SAMWELL:  I seem to remember you.
29253,MARWYN:  But you treated him anyway?
29254,SAMWELL:  I did.
29255,"MARWYN:  I forbade it because it's dangerous and rarely successful.  Especially on someone of that age.  You could have infected yourself and others.  You could have devastated the entire Citadel.  But you didn't.  It's a meticulous, difficult procedure.  Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed.  But you succeeded.  How?"
29256,SAMWELL:  I read the books and followed the instructions.
29257,NARRATOR:MARWYN stands up and walks from behind his desk.
29258,MARWYN:  That man is alive because of you.  You should be proud.
29259,"SAMWELL:  Thank you, Archmaester."
29260,MARWYN:  Come here.
29261,NARRATOR:MARWYN and SAMWELL walk to a table in the study.  It's covered in moldy books and scrolls.
29262,MARWYN:  All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away.  I need you to make copies of them.
29263,NARRATOR:SAMWELL says nothing.
29264,MARWYN:  You were expecting a reward?  Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel.  You'd better get started.  Be mindful of the paper mites.  They like flesh as well.
29265,NARRATOR:MARWYN walks out of the room to leave SAMWELL to his work.
29266,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS, VARYS, MISSANDEI and TYRION are standing around the painted table having a discussion.  TYRION knocks over one of the figurines as DAENERYS and VARYS speak."
29267,DAENERYS:  We need to find Euron Greyjoy's fleet and sink it.
29268,"VARYS:  Your Grace, he's already destroyed a good portion of our fleet.  To send our remaining ships after him --"
29269,DAENERYS:  I'm not talking about sending our ships after him.
29270,NARRATOR:DAENERYS pauses and looks at VARYS.  VARYS looks at TYRION.
29271,TYRION:  But you'll have to go yourself.  Euron's ships could be anywhere or in more than one place.  You'd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long.
29272,"DAENERYS:  I wouldn't be alone.  I'd have Drogon, Vicerion and Rhaegal.  What can anyone do to them?"
29273,MISSANDEI:  They can still do something to you.  It only takes one arrow.
29274,TYRION:  It's too great a risk.  You're too important.
29275,NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks down at the painted table.
29276,DAENERYS:  What about Casterly Rock?
29277,VARYS:  The Unsullied will be there soon.
29278,MISSANDEI:  And what will they face?
29279,VARYS:  A difficult situation.  They know we're coming.
29280,TYRION:  Yes.  Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister.  She will be ready.
29281,CUT TO: CASTERLY ROCK
29282,NARRATOR:TYRION continues narrating as the castle is seen in the distance on top of some cliffs.
29283,TYRION:  No one has ever taken the rock.
29284,NARRATOR:Lannister archers are shown on top of the battlements.  There are hundreds of ships sailing in the ocean heading to Casterly Rock.
29285,"TYRION:  The Lannister army is still the army my father built.  Well trained and well provisioned.  10,000 men at least.  They will see us coming."
29286,NARRATOR:GREY WORM is standing in a landing boat with other Unsullied on their way to the beach.  He puts on his helmet and readies himself for battle.
29287,TYRION:  They will be ready.
29288,NARRATOR:A man is running across the battlements stocking arrows for the archers.  Men are stacking rocks along the wall to throw down at the invaders.
29289,MAN:  Draw!  Loose!
29290,NARRATOR:Archers loose a set of arrows down onto rows of Unsullied marching on the walls of the castle.
29291,TYRION:  The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable.
29292,NARRATOR:Unsullied are being killed by incoming arrows.  Unsullied soldiers begin setting up ladders to scale the battlements.  The Lannister army throws rocks from the top of the wall.
29293,TYRION:  The fight up the walls will be hard.  We'll be at a disadvantage.  Many men will die.
29294,NARRATOR:The archers are easily defending the castle and killing Unsullied soldiers.
29295,NARRATOR:TYRION starts narrating a different battle plan.
29296,"TYRION:  Interesting thing about my father.  He built our house up from near ruin.  He built our army.  He built Casterly Rock as we know it, but he didn't build the sewers.  That was beneath him.  So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find.  Me.  He was right.  I was low.  The company I kept low, women mostly.  They weren't welcome at the Rock.  Father disapproved of that sort of behavior.  I couldn't walk them through the front gates.  I couldn't have them in my chambers.  So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself."
29297,NARRATOR:TYRION continues to narrate.  GREY WORM is in a landing boat sailing for a small opening in the side of a cliff.
29298,TYRION:  It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers.
29299,NARRATOR:The Unsullied sail into the passage.  They jump out of the boat and rush into the sewers.  GREY WORM pushes up a manhole cover and emerges into the castle.  Guards are seen running by and don't notice GREY WORM and the other Unsullied soldiers sneaking in.
29300,"TYRION:  No better place for low pursuits.  Casterly Rock, the impregnable fortress."
29301,NARRATOR:The Unsullied are running through the courtyard cutting down Lannister men.
29302,"TYRION:  As a good friend of mine once said, ""give me 10 good men and I'll impregnate the bitch."""
29303,NARRATOR:The Unsullied fight their way to the main door in the courtyard.  GREY WORM lifts off the bar and opens the door.  Unsullied soldiers coming rushing through the gate by the hundreds.  They begin cutting down every Lannister in their way.
29304,TYRION:  And so it begins.  They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces.  They will be outnumbered.  They will have less armor and fewer weapons.
29305,NARRATOR:There is general mayhem as the battle rages on in the courtyard.  GREY WORM breaks from the main fight and starts climbing to the battlements.  He is disposing of men with his spear on the way.
29306,"TYRION:  But as my sister's armies fights for her, the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.  They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.  They will be fighting for you.  And that is why they will triump."
29307,NARRATOR:GREY WORM is fighting in a hallway killing men from both directions.  A Lannister charges towards GREY WORM.  GREY WORM throws his spear and impales the Lannister soldier to a door.  The battle is over.  GREY WORM and other Unsullied soldiers are stepping over dozens of dead Lannisters on the battlements.  GREY WORM removes his helmet and one of his men speak in Valyrian.
29308,UNSULLIED 1:  There are none left.
29309,GREY WORM:  There are supposed to be more than this.  Many more.
29310,NARRATOR:GREY WORM turns to look out from the battlements towards the ocean.  The Unsullied fleet is under attack from the Iron Fleet and many boats are sunk or in flames.  GREY WORM's face twists in anger.  GREY WORM steps down from the battlement and grabs a bleeding Lannister soldier.  GREY WORM begins speaking English.
29311,GREY WORM:  Where are they?  Where are the rest of the Lannisters?
29312,"NARRATOR:Thousands of fully armored Lannister soldiers are marching towards Highgarden.  JAIME is riding his horse inspecting the lines of soldiers.  He rides over and joins BRONN, RANDYLL TARLEY and DICKON TARLEY.  The camera shifts focus to Lady Olenna who is watching the advancing army from a balcony in Highgarden.  She turns and walks back into her castle."
29313,NARRATOR:Some time has passed.  The battle is already over.  JAIME is walking in the courtyard and there are dead Tyrell men scattered everywhere.  JAIME climbs to the top of the tower to meet OLENNA TYRELL.
29314,CUT TO:  OLENNA'S QUARTERS
29315,NARRATOR:Olenna is sitting alone at a table wearing all black.  JAIME opens the door and enters the room.
29316,OLENNA:  It's done?
29317,JAIME:  It is.
29318,OLENNA:  And now the rains weep for our whores.  Did we fight well?
29319,JAIME:  I suppose as well as can be expected.
29320,NARRATOR:JAIME walks to the wine and pours two glasses.
29321,OLENNA:  It was never our forte.  Golden roses indeed.  Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock.
29322,"JAIME:  The truth is Casterly Rock isn't worth much anymore.  Well, it is to me.  My fond childhood memories won't keep Cersei on the throne."
29323,OLENNA:  So you'll just let them take it?
29324,"JAIME:  For now.  They won't be able to hold it.  Euron Greyjoy's navy burned their ships, we emptied the larders before we left.  Eventually they'll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros."
29325,NARRATOR:JAIME walks to where OLENNA is sitting and places both wine glasses on the table and sits down.
29326,"OLENNA:  And you took your army, your real army, and went where they weren't?"
29327,JAIME:  As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood.  There are always lessons in failures.
29328,OLENNA:  Yes.  You must be very wise by now.
29329,JAIME:  My father always said I was a slow learner.
29330,"OLENNA:  If he was so clever why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?  I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.  No more learning from my mistakes, eh?  How will you do it?  With that sword?"
29331,NARRATOR:JAIME shakes his head no.
29332,"OLENNA:  That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?  Not that he ever used it.  What did he call it?"
29333,JAIME:  Widow's Wail.
29334,"OLENNA:  He really was a cunt, wasn't he?  I did unspeakable things to protect my family, or watched them being done on my orders.  I never lost a night's sleep over them.  They were necessary.  And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did.  But your sister has done things I wasn't capable of imagining.  That was my prize mistake, a failure of imagination.  She's a monster, you do know that?"
29335,"JAIME:  To you, sure.  To others as well.  But after we've won and there's no one left to oppose us, the people living peaceful in the world she built, do you really think they'll wring their hands over the way she built it?"
29336,OLENNA:  You love her.  You really do love her.  You poor fool.  She'll be the end of you.
29337,"JAIME:  Possibly.  Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though, is there?"
29338,OLENNA:  What better person to discuss it with?  What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?  But perhaps you're right.  If she's driven you this far it's gone beyond your control.
29339,"JAIME:  Yes, it has."
29340,OLENNA:  She's a disease.  I regret my role in spreading it.  You will too.
29341,JAIME:  I think we're done here.
29342,NARRATOR:JAIME stands up and moves closer to OLENNA.
29343,OLENNA:  How will it happen?
29344,JAIME:  Cersei had several ideas.  Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep.  Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of King's Landing.  I talked her out of those.
29345,NARRATOR:OLENNA looks up at JAIME.  JAIME produces a small vial from a pouch on his belt and pops the cork off with his thumb.  He pours the contents of the vial into one of the glasses of wine and slides it in front of OLENNA.
29346,OLENNA:  Will there be pain?
29347,JAIME:  No.  I made sure of that.
29348,OLENNA:  That's good.
29349,NARRATOR:OLENNA reaches out and takes the wine.  She drinks the entire cup.  She looks back to JAIME.
29350,"OLENNA:  I'd hate to die like your son clawing at my neck, foam and bile spilling from my mouth, eyes blood red, skin purple.  It must have been horrible for you as a Kingsguard, as a father.  It was horrible enough for me.  A shocking scene.  Not at all what I intended.  You see, I'd never seen the posion work before.  Tell Cersei.  I want her to know it was me."
29351,NARRATOR:JAIME's face twists in anger.  He turns and walks out of the room leaving OLENNA alone.
29352,NARRATOR:END CREDITS
29353,JAIME:  Halt that wagon!
29354,NARRATOR:JAIME opens the carriage.  It is filled with gold bars and coins.  He picks up a large sack and hands it to BRONN.
29355,BRONN:  You just won the biggest prize in the world.  What could you possibly have to be upset about?  Come on.  You can tell me.  Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye?
29356,JAIME:  I'll save my confessions for the High Septon.
29357,BRONN:  There is no more High Septon.
29358,"JAIME:  No, there isn't, is there?"
29359,BRONN:  There is still the question of my prize.
29360,NARRATOR:JAIME is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold.  He stops and turns to BRONN.
29361,JAIME:  That's a lot of money I just gave you.
29362,BRONN:  It's not a castle.
29363,NARRATOR:BRONN turns and points to Highgarden.
29364,BRONN:  How about that one?  It's available.
29365,JAIME:  You don't want Highgarden.
29366,BRONN:  I beg to differ.
29367,"JAIME:  We're at war.  Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in.  Besides, think of the upkeep.  The more you own, the more it weighs you down."
29368,"BRONN:  Oh, is that why you're so fucking glum, eh?  All your new riches weighing you down?"
29369,NARRATOR:JAIME pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting.
29370,JAIME:  They're not mine.  The gold belongs to the Iron Bank.  We pay our debts.
29371,BRONN:  Right.  Just not to me.
29372,"JAIME:  Bronn of the Blackwater, formerly of whatever nameless shit heap you're from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid.  When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you."
29373,"BRONN:  Yes, I'm sure Queen Cersei's reign will be quiet and peaceful."
29374,JAIME:  Stranger things have happened.
29375,BRONN:  Like what?
29376,NARRATOR:RANDYLL TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback.  RANDYLL addresses JAIME.
29377,"RANDYLL:  The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, My Lord."
29378,JAIME:  The current harvest?
29379,DICKON:  We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach.
29380,NARRATOR:JAIME looks over to BRONN.
29381,"JAIME:  Ser Bronn, will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process?"
29382,BRONN:  I'm not much for shoveling weight.
29383,"JAIME:  No, but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest, I've heard you guys have a real talent for that."
29384,RANDYLL:  My Lord.
29385,DICKON:  My Lord.
29386,"NARRATOR:RANDYLL, DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance.  Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road."
29387,NARRATOR:CERSEI and TYCHO NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion.
29388,"TYCHO:  I must say, I don't think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment.  I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man, but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely."
29389,"CERSEI:  You're too kind, My Lord."
29390,"TYCHO:  I am neither kind, nor a lord, Your Grace.  I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent, its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic, not sentiment.  And the current arithmetic is outstanding.  The gold --"
29391,CERSEI:  Is on its way.  My brother is supervising its transportation himself.
29392,TYCHO:  Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed.  They've grown rather fond of your interest payments.
29393,CERSEI:  We must devise a way to raise their spirits.
29394,TYCHO:  Yes.  Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture.
29395,CERSEI:  My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it.
29396,TYCHO:  I see a great deal of potential in that venture.  I imagine that it would require outside investment?
29397,"CERSEI:  It will indeed.  I need to expand my armies, my navies.  My hand, Qyburn, had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos."
29398,TYCHO:  I know them well.  They've helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears.
29399,CERSEI:  That's good to hear.  I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me.
29400,"TYCHO:  Rest assured, Your Grace, you can count on the Iron Bank's support, as soon as the gold arrives."
29401,NARRATOR:BRAN is sitting in a wheelchair.  PETER BAELISH is sitting next to him.  BAELISH unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN.  It's the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago.
29402,BAELISH:  This is for you.
29403,NARRATOR:BAELISH flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN.
29404,"BAELISH:  The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat, but your mother fought him off."
29405,"NARRATOR:BRAN reaches out and takes the knife, turning it and looking it over carefully."
29406,"BAELISH:  The other dagger, the one that took her life, I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have.  I wasn't there for her when she needed me most.  But I am here for her now.  To do what she would have done, to protect her children.  Anything I can do for you, Brandon, you need only ask."
29407,BRAN:  Do you know who this belonged to?
29408,"BAELISH:  No.  That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings.  In a way, that dagger made you what you are today.  Forced from your home, driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall.  I imagine you've seen things most men wouldn't believe."
29409,NARRATOR:BAELISH hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN.  BRAN slides the knife into the sheath.
29410,"BAELISH:  To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world, I can only imagine --"
29411,BRAN:  Chaos is a ladder.
29412,NARRATOR:BRAN is staring at BAELISH.  BAELISH stops speaking.  The door opens and Meera appears.
29413,"BAELISH:  I'm sorry to have disturbed you, Lord Stark."
29414,NARRATOR:BAELISH stands up to leave.
29415,BRAN:  I'm not Lord Stark.
29416,NARRATOR:BAELISH bows and walks past Meera and closes the door.
29417,NARRATOR:MEERA notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair.
29418,MEERA:  What's that?
29419,BRAN:  Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily.
29420,MEERA:  It's a very good idea.
29421,BRAN:  You're leaving?
29422,"MEERA:  I don't want to leave you, but when they come I need to be with my family.  And you're safe, safe as anyone can be now.  You don't need me anymore."
29423,"BRAN:  No, I don't."
29424,MEERA:  That's all you've got to say?
29425,BRAN:  Thank you.
29426,MEERA:  Thank you?
29427,BRAN:  For helping me.
29428,MEERA:  My brother died for you.  Hodor and Summer died for you.  I almost died for you.  Bran!
29429,"BRAN:  I'm not really, not anymore.  I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark, but I remember so much else now."
29430,NARRATOR:MEERA begins to cry.
29431,MEERA:  You died in that cave.
29432,"NARRATOR:MEERA turns to walk out the door.  She hesitates looking at BRAN, then walks out."
29433,CUT TO:  EXT WINTERFELL:
29434,NARRATOR:There is a snow blown field.  ARYA is riding on a horse.  Winterfell can be seen far in the distance.
29435,NARRATOR:ARYA approaches the main gate on foot.  Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm.  There's indistinct chatter.  One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her.
29436,"MAN 1:  Hey, oh.  Where are you going?"
29437,ARYA:  In there.  I live here.
29438,MAN 1:  Fuck off.
29439,ARYA:  I'm Arya Stark.  This is my home.
29440,NARRATOR:Both men look at each and start laughing.
29441,MAN 1:  Arya Stark is dead.
29442,ARYA:  Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick.  They'll tell you who I am.
29443,MAN 2:  There's no Rodrick here.
29444,MAN 1:  Maester's name is Wolkan.
29445,"ARYA:  Go ask Jon Snow then, the King in the North.  He's my brother"
29446,MAN 1:  He's a thousand miles away.
29447,"MAN 2:  It's cold.  We're busy.  So, you know, best fuck off."
29448,MAN 1:  Mm-hmm.
29449,ARYA:  If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell?
29450,"MAN 2:  The Lady of Winterfell, Lady Stark."
29451,ARYA:  Which Lady Stark?
29452,MAN 1:  You tell us.  You're the one impersonating her sister.
29453,ARYA:  Tell Sansa her sister is home.
29454,"MAN 1:  Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you, just like us.  So for the last time, fuck off."
29455,NARRATOR:MAN 1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp.
29456,"ARYA:  I'm getting into this castle one way or another.  If I'm not who I say I am, I won't last long.  But if I am, and Sansa finds out that you turned me away..."
29457,NARRATOR:ARYA keeps glancing at the men.  They look uneasy.  They bring her inside of the gate.  They indicate towards a cart near the entrance.
29458,MAN 2:  You sit there.  Right there.  Don't move.
29459,NARRATOR:Both guards have a conversation out of earshot of Arya.
29460,MAN 2:  Go tell Lady Stark.  I'll watch her.

29469,"MAN 1:  When we turned around she had gone, My Lady.  She was nothing.  Some winter town girl."
29470,MAN 2:  She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn.
29471,"MAN 1:  Don't trouble yourself over it, My Lady.  We'll find her."

29477,NARRATOR:SANSA begins smiling then walking towards ARYA.  SANSA reaches out and hugs ARYA.
29478,SANSA:  You shouldn't have run from the guards.
29479,ARYA:  I didn't run.  You need better guards.
29480,NARRATOR:SANSA smirks at ARYA.
29481,"ARYA:  It suits you, Lady Stark.  Jon left you in charge?"
29482,"SANSA:  He did.  I hope he comes back soon.  I remember how happy he was to see me.  When he sees you, his heart will probably stop."
29483,NARRATOR:Both girls turn and look at the statue of Ned Stark.
29484,ARYA:  That doesn't look like him.  It should have been carved by someone who knew his face.
29485,SANSA:  Everyone who knew his face is dead.
29486,ARYA:  We're not.
29487,NARRATOR:ARYA turns to face SANSA.
29488,ARYA:  They say you killed Joffrey.  Did you?
29489,SANSA:  I wish I had.
29490,ARYA:  Me too.  I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.  However long my list got he was always first.
29491,SANSA:  Your list?
29492,ARYA:  Of people I'm going to kill.
29493,NARRATOR:SANSA begins to laugh.  ARYA joins her.
29494,SANSA:  How did you get back to Winterfell?
29495,ARYA:  It's a long story.  I imagine yours is too.
29496,SANSA:  Yes.  It's not a very pleasant one.
29497,"ARYA:  Mine neither, but our stories aren't over yet."
29498,"SANSA:  No, they're not."
29499,NARRATOR:The girls both embrace again.
29500,"SANSA:  Arya, Bran's home too."
29501,NARRATOR:ARYA smiles and looks at SANSA.  SANSA doesn't smile back.  The smile fades from ARYA's face.
29502,NARRATOR:BRAN is sitting next to the Weirwood tree.  SANSA and ARYA approach.  BRAN turns to look at them.  BRAN begins speaking to ARYA.
29503,BRAN:  You came home.
29504,NARRATOR:ARYA steps forward and throws her arms around BRAN.  SANSA smiles in the background.  ARYA lets go and steps back.
29505,BRAN:  I saw you at the crossroads.
29506,ARYA:  You saw me?
29507,BRAN:  I see quite a lot now.
29508,SANSA:  Bran has visions.
29509,BRAN:  I thought you might go to King's Landing.
29510,ARYA:  So did I.
29511,SANSA:  Why would you go back there?
29512,BRAN:  Cersei is on her list of names.
29513,NARRATOR:ARYA stares at BRAN.  ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
29514,SANSA:  Who else is on your list?
29515,ARYA:  Most of them are dead already.

29517,ARYA:  Where did you get this?

29519,"ARYA:  Littlefinger, he's here?"
29520,NARRATOR:ARYA turns to look at SANSA.
29521,SANSA:  He's declared for House Stark.
29522,NARRATOR:SANSA steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him.
29523,SANSA:  Why would he give you a dagger?
29524,BRAN:  He thought I'd want it.
29525,SANSA:  Why?
29526,BRAN:  Because it was meant to kill me.
29527,SANSA:  The cutthroat after your fall?
29528,ARYA:  Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger?
29529,BRAN:  Someone very wealthy wanted me dead.
29530,SANSA:  He's not a generous man.  He wouldn't give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back.
29531,BRAN:  It doesn't matter.
29532,SANSA:  What do you mean it doesn't matter?
29533,BRAN:  I don't want it.
29534,NARRATOR:BRAN holds the knife out to ARYA.  ARYA looks at BRAN.
29535,ARYA:  Are you sure?  It's Valyrian steel.
29536,BRAN:  It's wasted on a cripple.

29540,BRIENNE:  I did next to nothing.
29541,"PODRICK:  You're too hard on yourself, My Lady."
29542,BRIENNE:  I'm not a --
29543,NARRATOR:BRIENNE pauses for a moment.
29544,"BRIENNE:  Thank you, Podrick."
29545,CUT TO:  DRAGONSTONE
29546,NARRATOR:DAENERYS and MISSANDEI are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard.
29547,"MISSANDEI:  Your Grace, there's still no word from the Unsullied."
29548,DAENERYS:  Soon.  They will come back to me.
29549,MISSANDEI:  He better.

29555,NARRATOR:Jon Snow appears at the bottom of the path.
29556,JON:  Your Grace.
29557,NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard.  She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down.
29558,DAENERYS:  It's all right.
29559,NARRATOR:DAENERYS descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking with JON.  They walk along the beach until they reach a cave.  DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch.
29560,JON:  I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits.
29561,NARRATOR:JON leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave.  He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls.  He continues walking deeper into the cave.
29562,"JON:  So this is it, all we'll ever need."
29563,NARRATOR:DAENERYS is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass.
29564,"JON:  There is something else I want to show your, Your Grace."
29565,NARRATOR:JON and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave.  There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass.
29566,JON:  The Children of the Forest made these.
29567,DAENERYS:  When?
29568,JON:  A very long time ago.
29569,DAENERYS:  They were right here standing where we're standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters.  Maybe even before there were men.
29570,JON:  No.
29571,NARRATOR:DAENERYS stops looking at the walls and turns to look at JON.  JON walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals.  The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together.
29572,JON:  They were here together the Children and the First Men.
29573,DAENERYS:  Doing what?  Fighting each other?
29574,NARRATOR:JON takes DAENERYS by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall.  There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers.
29575,"DAENERYS:  They fought together against their common enemy.  Despite their differences, despite their suspicions, together.  We need to do the same if we're going to survive."
29576,NARRATOR:JON and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King.
29577,JON:  Because the enemy is real.  It's always been real.
29578,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to look at JON.
29579,DAENERYS:  And you say you can't defeat them without my armies and my dragons?
29580,"JON:  No, I don't think I can."
29581,NARRATOR:DAENERYS steps forward closer to JON.
29582,DAENERYS:  I will fight for you.  I will fight for the north...when you bend the knee.
29583,"JON:  My people won't accept a southern ruler, not after everything they've suffered."
29584,NARRATOR:DAENERYS steps even closer to JON until they're face to face.
29585,DAENERYS:  They will if their king does.  They chose you to lead them.  They chose you to protect them.  Isn't their survival more important than your pride?
29586,"NARRATOR:JON and DAENERYS, DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave.  As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them.  DAENERYS begins addressing Tyrion."
29587,DAENERYS:  What is it?
29588,TYRION:  We took Casterly Rock.
29589,DAENERYS:  That's very good to hear.
29590,NARRATOR:TYRION and VARYS look at each other.  They aren't eager to deliver the bad news.
29591,DAENERYS:  Isn't it?
29592,NARRATOR:The group are all walking along the beach.  Daenerys is displeased.
29593,DAVOS:  You'll want to discuss this amongst yourselves.  Perhaps --
29594,DAENERYS:  You will stay.  All my allies are gone.  They've been taken from me while I've been sitting here on this island.
29595,TYRION:  We still have the largest army.
29596,DAENERYS:  Who won't be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach.
29597,TYRION:  Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back.  We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland.  Commit to the blockade of King's Landing.  We have a plan.  It's still the right plan.
29598,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS stops walking, turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion."
29599,"DAENERYS:  The right plan?  Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands and the Reach."
29600,TYRION:  If I've underestimated our enemies --
29601,"DAENERYS:  Our enemies?  Your family, you mean.  Perhaps you don't want to hurt them after all."
29602,NARRATOR:DAENERYS begins looking out to the ocean.  Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water.
29603,DAENERYS:  Enough with the clever plans.
29604,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns back and looks at TYRION.
29605,DAENERYS:  I have three large dragons.  I'm going to fly them to the Red Keep.
29606,TYRION:  We've discussed this.
29607,DAENERYS:  My enemies are in the Red Keep.  What kind of a queen am I if I'm not willing to risk my life to fight them?
29608,TYRION:  A smart one.
29609,NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks over to JON SNOW.
29610,DAENERYS:  What do you think I should do?
29611,JON:  I would never presume to --
29612,DAENERYS:  I'm at war.  I'm losing.
29613,NARRATOR:DAENERYS begins walking close to JON.
29614,DAENERYS:  What do you think I should do?
29615,NARRATOR:JON looks over the ocean at the dragons flying.
29616,JON:  I never thought that dragons would exist again.  No one did.  The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen.  Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen.  Build a world that's different from the shit one they've always known.
29617,NARRATOR:JON glances back towards the dragons.
29618,"JON:  But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities, you're not different.  You're just more of the same."
29619,NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks back out to her dragons flying along the water.
29620,NARRATOR:BRIENNE and PODRICK are sparring.  BRIENNE kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt.

29625,BRIENNE:  Up.
29626,NARRATOR:BRIENNE begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows.  BRIENNE hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground.
29627,BRIENNE:  And don't --
29628,ARYA:  Don't fight someone like her in the first place.
29629,NARRATOR:PODRICK stands up and retrieves his sword.  ARYA walks closer to speak to BRIENNE.
29630,BRIENNE:  Nice sword.  Very nice dagger.

29635,ARYA(TO BRIENNE):  It's been awhile since I've trained.
29636,"BRIENNE:  I can go and find the Master of Arms for you, My Lady."
29637,ARYA:  He didn't beat the hound.  You did.  I want to train with you.
29638,NARRATOR:BRIENNE chuckles.
29639,"ARYA:  You swore to serve both of my mother's daughters, didn't you?"
29640,NARRATOR:BRIENNE nods her head in agreement.
29641,"BRIENNE:  Move aside, Podrick."
29642,"NARRATOR:PODRICK backs away.  ARYA draws her sword, Needle."
29643,"BRIENNE:  You can't use that, My Lady.  It's too small."
29644,ARYA:  I won't cut you.  Don't worry.
29645,NARRATOR:BRIENNE smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture.
29646,BRIENNE:  I'll try not to.
29647,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack.  BRIENNE attacks again and ARYA sidesteps, dodges multiple strikes and parries BRIENNE while smiling.  ARYA strikes at BRIENNE and hits her hand causing BRIENNE to flinch and lose her two-handed grip on her sword.  BRIENNE regains composure and starts to circle ARYA.  BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony.  ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back.  BRIENNE strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks, spins and stabs behind her back and hits BRIENNE in the knee causing BRIENNE's sword to strike the dirt.  BRIENNE kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground.  ARYA quickly gets back to her feet.  BRIENNE overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground.  BRIENNE strikes again but ARYA dodges, draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it near BRIENNE's neck.  BRIENNE and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling."
29648,BRIENNE:  Who taught you to do that?

29653,DAVOS:  What do you think of her?
29654,JON:  Who?
29655,NARRATOR:DAVOS sighs
29656,DAVOS:  I believe you know of whom I speak.
29657,JON:  I think she has a good heart.
29658,DAVOS:  A good heart?  I've noticed you starring at that good heart.
29659,"JON:  There's no time for that.  I saw the Night King, Davos.  I looked into his eyes.  How many men do we have in the north to fight him?  10,000?  Less?"
29660,DAVOS:  Fewer.
29661,JON:  What?
29662,NARRATOR:DAVOS and JON near the end of the path.  MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean.

29667,JON:  It doesn't matter.
29668,"MISSANDEI:  Forgive me, but may I ask a question?"
29669,JON:  Of course.
29670,"MISSANDEI:  Your name is Jon Snow, but your father's name was Ned Stark?"
29671,JON:  I'm a bastard.  My mother and father weren't married.
29672,DAVOS:  Is the custom different in Naarth?
29673,MISSANDEI:  We don't have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesn't exist.
29674,DAVOS:  The sounds liberating.
29675,JON:  Why did you leave your homeland?
29676,MISSANDEI:  I was stolen away by slavers.
29677,JON:  I'm sorry.
29678,"DAVOS:  If I may, how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen?"
29679,MISSANDEI:  She bought me from my master and set me free.
29680,"DAVOS:  That was good of her.  Of course you're serving her now, aren't you?"
29681,MISSANDEI:  I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen.  Because I believe in her.
29682,JON:  And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow --
29683,MISSANDEI:  Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune.
29684,JON:  You believe that?
29685,"MISSANDEI:  I know it.  All of us who came with her from Essos, we believe in her.  She's not our queen because she's the daughter of some king we never knew.  She's the queen we chose."
29686,DAVOS(to JON):  You'll forgive me if I switch sides.
29687,NARRATOR:JON notices a single ship sailing into the bay.  It has a kraken sigil.  MISSANDEI turns to look.

29691,NARRATOR:THEON steps closer to JON.
29692,"THEON:  Sansa, is she all right?"
29693,NARRATOR:JON grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face.
29694,JON:  What you did for her is the only reason I'm not killing you.
29695,NARRATOR:JON releases THEON.
29696,DAVOS:  We heard your uncle attacked your fleet.  We thought you were dead.
29697,THEON:  I should be.
29698,DAVOS:  Your sister?
29699,THEON:  Euron has her.  I came to ask the queen to help get her back.

29703,RANDYLL:  All of the gold is safely through the gates of King's Landing.
29704,JAIME:  Good.
29705,"RANDYLL:  We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall.  If the head of the line is ambushed, the tail will never be able to reinforce in time."
29706,JAIME:  We are stretched a bit thin.
29707,"RANDYLL:  With your permission, flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility."
29708,JAIME:  Let's give them fair warning first.  These men fought well at Highgarden.
29709,"NARRATOR:RANDYLL is clearly disappointed.  He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers.  JAIME and BRONN exchange glances, then follow RANDYLL.  BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks.  DICKON TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation."

29716,JAIME:  And?
29717,DICKON:  It was glorious.
29718,BRONN:  Come on.  Your father's not here.
29719,DICKON:  All my life we've been pledged to House Tyrell.  I knew some of those men.  I hunted with them.
29720,JAIME:  They didn't deserve to die.  But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl.  So here we are.
29721,DICKON:  I didn't expect it to smell like that.
29722,BRONN:  Men shit themselves when they die.  Didn't they teach you that at fancy lad school?
29723,NARRATOR:JAIME looks over at BRONN
29724,"BRONN:  Well, I learned it when I was 5."

They switch from a seated position to standing atop their saddles shooting bow and arrow.  The Lannister archers fire back and many men are killed.  DAENERYS and DROGON circle around and billow flames across the battlefield.  DAENERYS steers DROGON down the King's Road.  DROGON spews flames and destroys the carriages along the road.  Carts are exploding into pieces, barrels are flying through the air.  JAIME is looking at the carnage in astonishment."
29748,JAIME:  Archers!  Archers with me!
29749,NARRATOR:A group of archers break from the main battle and follow JAIME and BRONN.  JAIME lines the men up to counter DAENERYS and DROGON.
29750,JAIME:  Knock!
29751,ARCHERS:  Knock!  Draw!
29752,NARRATOR:DROGON loops around and is making a pass on JAIME and the archers.  DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men.
29753,JAIME:  Loose!
29754,NARRATOR:The archers fire their arrows in unison.  DAENERYS sees the projectiles and turns Drogon so the arrows bounce harmlessly off his breast.  She makes a run on another line of carriages and DROGON burns them in a single breath.  Men are screaming and catching on fire.  JAIME and BRONN survey the damage.
29755,JAIME:  Qyburn's scorpion is over there.
29756,BRONN:  Go get it then.
29757,JAIME:  I can't shoot with one hand.
29758,NARRATOR:JAIME holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point.
29759,NARRATOR:BRONN hesitates for a moment.  He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow.  JAIME draws his sword and rides into battle.
29760,JAIME:  Come on!
29761,"NARRATOR:A Dothraki screamer wielding two swords charges JAIME.  JAIME is blocking the attacks but is getting overpowered.  DICKON stabs the screamer through his back.  JAIME nods at DICKON.  BRONN is making his way to the crossbow.  A Dothraki screamer sees him and charges.  BRONN reaches behind him and retrieves a small sword.  He throws the sword at the Dothraki but the screamer parries it.  BRONN draws his primary sword and the two men charge at each other.  As BRONN is about to strike, the screamer leans over and cuts BRONN's horse's leg off causing BRONN to fall to the ground.  BRONN's bag of gold hits the ground and splits open.  The screamer is turning his horse around and is about to attack BRONN again.  BRONN abandons the gold and runs into the mayhem trying to lose the mounted rider.  BRONN pushes a flaming Lannister soldier out of the way.  He pulls a sword out of a dead man and uses it to start fighting Dothraki.  DROGON flies overhead and spews flames through the air.  BRONN manages to escape the mounted rider and disappear into the fog.  The screamer dismounts and continues the search on foot.  The screamer climbs onto a covered wagon to check for BRONN.  When he pulls the canvas back he see's BRONN behind the crossbow with a bolt pointed at him.  BRONN fires the bolt and impales the Dothraki screamer.  BRONN pulls a lever and the sides of the wagon drop down revealing the crossbow.  BRONN reloads the weapon and begins making adjustments to line up a shot on DROGON."
29762,BRONN:  Where are you?
29763,NARRATOR:TYRION walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards.  He can see Lannisters being slaughtered.  One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak.
29764,GUARD:  Your people can't fight.
29765,NARRATOR:TYRION is watching the mayhem.  Men are screaming and engulfed in flames.  Horses and carriages run wild with no driver.  JAIME is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde.  Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces.  Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire.  DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water.  JAIME sees her approaching his position.
29766,JAIME:  Take cover!
29767,NARRATOR:DROGON spits flames into the Lannister position.  The men standing there are reduced to standing ash.  The wind blows them away.  BRONN is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow.  He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire.  A bolt sails past DROGON and misses.  BRONN reloads the machine.  DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow.  BRONN takes his time aiming his shot.
29768,BRONN:  Come on you fucker.
29769,NARRATOR:DAENERYS commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow.
29770,DAENERYS:  Dracarys!
29771,"NARRATOR:Before DROGON can send flames, BRONN fires a bolt that strikes DROGON in the wing.  DROGON begins to pinwheel out of control towards the ground.  BRONN is smiling.  He whips the machine around and begins reloading.  DAENERYS and DROGON are falling from the sky.  DROGON regains control and begins hovering over the river.  BRONN realizes he doesn't have time to reload and dives out of the way of the incoming dragonfire.  DROGON spits flames at the machine and instantly destroys it.  Flames lick over BRONN but he is uninjured.  DROGON is forced to land on the edge of the river due to his wound.  DAENERYS climbs from her mount and rushes to pull the spear from DROGON's wing.  JAIME is 100 yards from DAENERYS watching her.  She is all alone.  JAIME sees a spear sticking out of a dead man.  TYRION spots JAIME across the battlefield."
29772,"TYRION:  Flee, you idiot!"
29773,NARRATOR:JAIME looks at DAENERYS and readies himself.  He spurs his horse onward.
29774,"JAIME:  Come on, boy.  Come on!"
29775,NARRATOR:JAIME grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position.  JAIME's horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water.  TYRION is watching JAIME's attempt to kill DAENERYS.
29776,TYRION:  You fucking idiot.
29777,"NARRATOR:JAIME is getting close.  DAENERYS turns at the last moment to see JAIME bearing down on her spear in hand.  DROGON notices JAIME, turns his head and spews flames.  BRONN appears from nowhere and manages to dive off of his horse and knock JAIME and himself in the water before they're both consumed by fire.  Their horses are instantly burned to death.  JAIME is being dragged down by a full set of armor into the dark water.  JAIME sinks into blackness and out of sight."
29778,NARRATOR:END CREDITS
29779,JAIME:  You could have killed me.
29780,BRONN:  What the fuck were you doing back there?
29781,JAIME:  Ending the war by killing her.
29782,BRONN:  You saw the dragon between you and her?
29783,NARRATOR:BRONN looks incredulously at JAIME.
29784,BRONN:  And?
29785,NARRATOR:JAIME sits up and says nothing to BRONN.  BRONN sits up and faces JAIME.
29786,"BRONN:  Listen to me, cunt.  Till I get what I'm owed, a dragon doesn't get to kill you.  You don't get to kill you.  Only I get to kill you."
29787,"JAIME:  That was only one of them.  She has two more.  If she decides to use them, to really use them --"
29788,BRONN:  You're fucked.
29789,JAIME:  Don't you mean we're fucked?
29790,"BRONN:  No, I do not.  Dragons are where our partnership ends.  I'm not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on King's Landing."
29791,JAIME:  I have to tell Cersei.
29792,NARRATOR:BRONN pauses and looks at JAIME.
29793,BRONN:  Best well jump back in that river.
29794,NARRATOR:BRONN stands up and walks away.  JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle.
29795,NARRATOR:TYRION is walking over an ash covered ground.  There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about.  Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies.  A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to where DAENERYS and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners.  DAENERYS addresses the captured soldiers.
29796,"DAENERYS:  I know what Cersei has told you, that I've come to destroy your cities --"
29797,NARRATOR:The camera pans around the prisoners.  The men are covered in filth and blood from the battle.
29798,"NARRATOR:A few Lannister men kneel to the ground, while most remain standing.  DROGON roars and moves closer to the men.  Almost all the Lannister men quickly kneel while a few still remain standing including RANDYLL and DICKON TARLEY.  DAENERYS speaks to RANDYLL."
29799,"DAENERYS:  Step forward, My Lord."
29800,NARRATOR:RANDYLL takes several steps towards DAENERYS and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men.
29801,DAENERYS:  You will not kneel?
29802,RANDYLL:  I already have a queen.
29803,"TYRION:  My sister, she wasn't your queen until recently though, was she, until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time.  So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible."
29804,"RANDYLL:  There are no easy choices in war.  Say what you will about your sister, she was born in Westeros, has lived here all her life.  You on the other hand, you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader.  One with no ties to this land, an army of savages at her back."
29805,DAENERYS:  You will not trade your honor for your life.  I respect that.
29806,NARRATOR:TYRION turns to speak to DAENERYS.
29807,"TYRION:  Perhaps he could take the black, Your Grace.  Whatever else he is, he is a true soldier.  He would be invaluable at the Wall."
29808,RANDYLL:  You cannot send me to the Wall.  You are not my queen.
29809,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to look at her Dothraki escort.  The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL.  As the men are pulling RANDYLL away DICKON steps forward.
29810,DICKON:  You will have to kill me too.
29811,NARRATOR:RANDYLL pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son.
29812,RANDYLL:  Step back and shut your mouth.
29813,DAENERYS(to DICKON):  Who are you?
29814,RANDYLL:  A stupid boy.
29815,"DICKON:  I'm Dickon Tarley, son of Randyll Tarley."
29816,TYRION:  You are the future of your house.  This war has already wiped one great house from the world.  Don't let it happen again.  Bend the knee.
29817,NARRATOR:DICKON looks to RANDYLL.  RANDYLL nods to his son.
29818,DICKON:  I will not.
29819,NARRATOR:TYRION turns to speak to DAENERYS.  He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear.
29820,"TYRION:  Your Grace, nothing strips bold notions from a man's head like a few weeks in a dark cell."
29821,DAENERYS:  I meant what I said.  I'm not here to put men in chains.  If that becomes an option many will take it.  I gave them a choice.  They made it.
29822,"TYRION:  Your Grace, if you begin beheading entire families --"
29823,DAENERYS:  I'm not beheading anyone.
29824,NARRATOR:TYRION pauses and looks over the DROGON.  DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings.
29825,TYRION:  Your Grace --
29826,NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal.  The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON.  RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm.
29827,"DAENERYS:  Lord Randyll Tarley, Dickon Tarley, I, Daenerys of House Targaryen, First of my name, Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons, sentence you to die."
29828,NARRATOR:DAENERYS pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON.
29829,DAENERYS:  Dracarys.
29830,NARRATOR:DROGON draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men.  They are instantly engulfed in flames.  They both collapse into ash after a few seconds.  There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood.  The Lannister men recoil in horror.  Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground.  DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield.
29831,"NARRATOR:JAIME is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEI's room.  As he approaches, QYBURN exits the queen's chambers."
29832,QYBURN:  My Lord.
29833,NARRATOR:JAIME passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges into CERSEI's quarters.  CERSEI stand and walks over to JAIME.
29834,CERSEI:  How many men did we lose?
29835,JAIME:  We haven't done a full counting.
29836,"CERSEI:  It's armies that win wars.  We have the Tyrell gold, we have the Iron Bank behind us.  We can buy mercenaries."
29837,NARRATOR:JAIME shakes his head.
29838,"CERSEI:  They're not the same as our men but they'll fight if they're well paid, which they will be."
29839,"JAIME:  I just saw the Dothraki fight.  They'll beat any mercenary army.  They'll beat any army I've ever seen.  Killing our men wasn't war for them, it was sport.  Her dragon burned a thousand wagons.  Qyburn's scorpion fired bolts bigger than you.  They couldn't stop it.  And she has three of them.  This isn't a war we can win."
29840,"CERSEI:  So what do we do?  Sue for peace?  I sit on her father's throne, the father you betrayed and murdered.  And in her mind she's winning.  What sort of offer do you think she'd make?"
29841,NARRATOR:CERSEI turns and walks away from JAIME.
29842,CERSEI:  Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son.
29843,JAIME:  He didn't.
29844,"CERSEI:  You saw the crossbow, you saw his body."
29845,NARRATOR:JAIME walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing.
29846,JAIME:  I'm not talking about father.  Tyrion didn't kill Joffrey.  He had nothing to do with it.
29847,CERSEI:  After all this time it still amazes me --
29848,JAIME:  It was Olenna.  She confessed before she died.
29849,CERSEI:  And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her?
29850,JAIME:  After.
29851,CERSEI:  And you believed her?
29852,JAIME:  If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen?  Which one would Margerey been better able to control?  Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms?  She was telling the truth.
29853,"NARRATOR:CERSEI looks away, then sits down."
29854,CERSEI:  I shouldn't have listened to you.  She should have died screaming.
29855,"JAIME:  She's dead like her son, her grandchildren, her whole house.  And if we don't find a way out of this war we'll follow them."
29856,CERSEI:  So we fight and die or we submit and die.  I know my choice.  A soldier should know his.
29857,NARRATOR:JON SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean.   DROGON roars and flies over him with DAENERYS on his back.  DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him.  DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JON's face.  DROGON creeps closer until he is inches  from JON.  JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON.  DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him.  DAENERYS  looks surprised and steps down from her mount.  DROGON turns and flies away.
29858,"DAENERYS:  They're beautiful, aren't they?"
29859,"JON:  That wasn't the word I was thinking of, but, yes, they are.  Gorgeous beasts."
29860,"DAENERYS:  They're not beasts to me.  No matter how big they get, how terrifying to everyone else, they're my children."
29861,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance.
29862,JON:  You weren't gone long.
29863,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns back to JON.
29864,DAENERYS:  No.
29865,JON:  And?
29866,DAENERYS:  And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday.
29867,NARRATOR:JON pauses and doesn't say anything.
29868,DAENERYS:  You're not sure how you feel about that?
29869,"JON:  No, I'm not."
29870,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns and starts walking towards the castle, JON follows."
29871,DAENERYS:  How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons?
29872,JON:  Thousands.
29873,DAENERYS:  We both want to help people.  We can only help them from a position of strength.  Sometimes strength is terrible.  When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people.
29874,JON:  Ser Davos gets carried away.
29875,DAENERYS:  So it was a figure of speech?
29876,NARRATOR:JON doesn't say anything.  A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue.
29877,"GUARD:  This man says he is your friend, Khaleesi."
29878,NARRATOR:The guard steps to the side and JORAH MORMONT stands behind him.  DAENERYS answers the guard in Dothraki.
29879,DAENERYS:  He is my friend.
29880,NARRATOR:JORAH kneels before DAENERYS.
29881,JORAH:  Your Grace.
29882,NARRATOR:JORAH stands.
29883,"DAENERYS:  Jon Snow, this is Ser Jorah Mormont, an old friend."
29884,JON:  I served with your father.  He was a great man.
29885,NARRATOR:JORAH nods to JON.
29886,DAENERYS:  You look strong.  You found a cure?
29887,"JORAH:  I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.  I return to your service, my queen, if you'll have me."
29888,DAENERYS:  It would be my honor.
29889,NARRATOR:DAENERYS steps forward and hugs JORAH.
29890,CUT TO:  EXT. WINTERFELL
29891,NARRATOR:A group of ravens are resting on a tree.  Several of the ravens' eyes wash white.  They take off and fly over Winterfell.  They cross frozen fields and over a snowy mountain.  They arrive at The Wall at Eastwatch-by-the-sea and continue over the Wall.  The ravens fly many miles over tundra and more mountains.  The birds crest a hill and thousands of dead men can be seen marching south.  A group of riders and the Night King are on top of an outcrop watching the dead file past.  As the ravens approach the Night King peers in their direction and the birds scatter and disperse.
29892,NARRATOR:BRAN's eyes are pure white.  They wash back to their normal color.  He is sitting in front of the Weirwood.  Maester Wolkan stands next to him.
29893,BRAN:  Ravens.  We need to send ravens.
29894,NARRATOR:WOLKAN nods his head to BRAN.
29895,NARRATOR:ARCHMAESTER MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table.  MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents.  SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls.  MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books.
29896,"MAESTER 1:  I put very little stock in it myself.  Prophecies of doom are never in short supply, especially when winter comes."
29897,MARWYN:  I remember Wolkan.   A bit timid but a sharp mind.
29898,"MAESTER 1:  The north has dulled many good maester's wits.  I'm not sure if it's the cold, the drink, or the company."
29899,NARRATOR:All the maesters chuckle.
29900,MAESTER 1:  A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes.
29901,NARRATOR:SAM stops working and turns around.
29902,MARWYN:  It is a bit much.  Still we ought to --
29903,SAMWELL:  Brandon Stark --
29904,NARRATOR:The maesters all turn in their seats to look at SAMWELL.
29905,MARWYN:  Do you know him?
29906,SAMWELL:  I let him through the Wall years ago.  I saw him go beyond the wall.
29907,MARWYN:  And?
29908,"SAMWELL:  Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could.  Not the Night's Watch, not the Wildlings, no one.  Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say."
29909,MAESTER 1:  Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind.
29910,MARWYN:  I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming.
29911,NARRATOR:SAMWELL steps forward and clears his throat.
29912,"SAMWELL:  Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you.  If you tell people the threat is real they'll believe it.  If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall they'll do it.  And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night, they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good."
29913,MARWYN:  It could be done.  And this news could be authentic.  It's possible.  It's also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest.
29914,MAESTER 1:  That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples.
29915,"SAMWELL:  Archmaester, please.  It's real.  I've seen it."
29916,MARWYN:  We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification.  I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another.
29917,SAMWELL:  Archmaester --
29918,"MARWYN:  That will be all, Tarley."
29919,NARRATOR:SAM turns to collect his work and leave.  The maesters begin talking to one another.
29920,"MAESTER 2:  It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone, the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest."
29921,NARRATOR:The maesters all chuckle.
29922,MAESTER 1:  Don't forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer.
29923,NARRATOR:The maesters continue laughing.  SAMWELL gets the last of his work and walks out of the door in disgust.  MAESTER 1 turns to look at MARWYN.
29924,MAESTER 1:  Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive?
29925,MARWYN:  I'm afraid so.
29926,MAESTER 2:  Horrible business.
29927,MARWYN:  I don't have the heart to tell him yet.  He's a good lad.
29928,NARRATOR:MARWYN crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table.
29929,MARWYN:  Right.  The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked...
29930,NARRATOR:VARYS and TYRION are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone.  VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone.  TYRION is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS.
29931,TYRION:  All rulers demand that people bend the knee.  It's why they're rulers.  She gave Tarley a choice.  A man who had taken up arms against her.  What else could she do?
29932,VARYS:  Not burn him alive alongside his son.
29933,"TYRION:  I am her hand, not her head.  I can't make her decisions for her."
29934,VARYS:  That's what I used to tell myself about her father.  I found the traitors but I wasn't the one burning them alive.  I was only a purveyor of information.
29935,"NARRATOR:VARYS reaches over to TYRION's cup of wine, picks it up and begins to drink from it.  He grimaces as he drinks."
29936,"VARYS:  It's what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  As the pitch of their screams rose higher, ""I'm not the one doing it.""  When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room, ""I'm not the one doing it."""
29937,NARRATOR:VARYS drinks again and sets the cup down next to TYRION.  TYRION picks it up.
29938,TYRION:  Daenerys is not her father.
29939,VARYS:  And she never will be... with the right counsel.  You need to find a way to make her listen.
29940,NARRATOR:TYRION looks down at the note in VARYS's hand.
29941,TYRION:  Who is that for?
29942,VARYS:  Jon Snow.
29943,TYRION:  Did you read it?
29944,VARYS:  It's a sealed scroll for the King in the North.
29945,NARRATOR:TYRION pauses and drinks from his cup of wine.
29946,TYRION:  What's it say?
29947,VARYS:  Nothing good.
29948,NARRATOR:DAENERYS and VARYS are seated at the painted table.  TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen.  DAVOS and JON SNOW are standing on the other end of the table.  JON is holding a raven scroll and reading it.
29949,JON:  I thought Arya was dead.  I thought Bran was dead.
29950,DAENERYS:  I'm happy for you.  You don't look happy.
29951,JON:  Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch.  If they make it past the wall --
29952,VARYS:  The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years.  Presumably --
29953,NARRATOR:JON interrupts VARYS.
29954,JON:  I need to go home.
29955,DAENERYS:  You said you don't have enough men.
29956,JON:  We'll fight with the men we have.  Unless you'll join us.
29957,DAENERYS:  And give the country to Cersei?  As soon as I march away she marches in.
29958,TYRION:  Perhaps not.  Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children.  What if we prove her wrong?
29959,JON:  I don't think she'll come see the dead at my invitation.
29960,NARRATOR:TYRION begins walking around the table closer to JON.
29961,TYRION:  So bring the dead to her.
29962,DAENERYS:  I thought that was what we are trying to avoid.
29963,TYRION:  We don't have to bring the whole army.  Only one soldier.
29964,DAVOS(to JON):  Is that possible?
29965,JON:  The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall.
29966,TYRION:  Bring one of these things down to King's Landing and show her the truth.
29967,VARYS:  Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital.
29968,TYRION:  The only person she listens to is Jaime.  He may listen to me.
29969,DAENERYS:  And how would you get into King's Landing.
29970,NARRATOR:Everyone in the room stops and looks at DAVOS.
29971,"DAVOS:  I can smuggle you in, but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you, I'm warning you, I'm not a fighter."
29972,NARRATOR:TYRION nods his head.
29973,"DAENERYS:  Well, it will all be for nothing if we don't have one of these dead men."
29974,VARYS:  Fair point.  How do you propose to find one?
29975,NARRATOR:JON pauses and stares at the ground.  JORAH breaks the silence.
29976,JORAH:  With the queen's permission I'll go north and take one.
29977,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to look at JORAH.
29978,JORAH:  You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you.  Allow me to serve you.
29979,JON:  The free folk will help us.  They know the real north better than anyone.
29980,DAVOS:  They won't follow Ser Jorah.
29981,JON:  They won't have to.
29982,DAVOS:  You can't lead a raid beyond the wall.  You're not in the Night's Watch anymore.  You're King in the North.
29983,JON:  I'm the only one here whose fought them.  I'm the only one here who knows them.
29984,DAENERYS:  I haven't given you permission to leave.
29985,"JON:  With respect, Your Grace, I don't need your permission.  I am a king.  And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive.  I put my trust in you, a stranger, because I knew it was the best chance for my people, for all our people.  Now I'm asking you to trust in a stranger because it's our best chance."
29986,NARRATOR:DAENERYS pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement.
29987,"NARRATOR:Northen lords including ROBETT GLOVER, YOHN ROYCE and LYANNA MORMONT are congregated in the Great Hall.  ARYA walks into the room and hears a loud discussion.  The lords are adressing SANSA who is seated at the head table."
29988,"ROBETT:  The King in the North should stay in the north.  We did not choose you to rule us, My Lady, but perhaps we should have."
29989,NARRATOR:The men agree in unison.  YOHN ROYCE stands up and walks in front of SANSA.
29990,"YOHN:  The Knights of the Vale came here for you, Lady Stark."
29991,"SANSA:  You're very kind, my lords, but Jon is our king.  He is doing what he thinks is best."
29992,NARRATOR:The men sit down and everyone in the hall begins talking to one another.
29993,NARRATOR:SANSA and ARYA are walking through the hall to SANSA's quarters having a discussion.
29994,SANSA:  I warned Jon this would happen.  He can't leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost.
29995,ARYA:  He didn't.  He trusted you to hold it for him.
29996,"SANSA:  Well, he's not making it easy.  The northern lords are proud."
29997,NARRATOR:The girls arrive at SANSA's quarters.  ARYA is glancing around the room.
29998,ARYA:  These are mother and father's chambers.
29999,SANSA:  And?
30000,ARYA:  Nothing.
30001,SANSA:  Don't do that.
30002,NARRATOR:SANSA turns around to face ARYA.
30003,ARYA:  What?
30004,SANSA:  Say what you mean.
30005,ARYA:  You always liked nice things.  It made you feel better than everyone.
30006,NARRATOR:SANSA drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA.
30007,SANSA:  Are you angry with me?
30008,ARYA:  They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened.
30009,"SANSA:  I listened to their complaints, which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell."
30010,ARYA:  Their opinions are important to you?
30011,"SANSA:  Glover has 500 men.  Royce has 2,000.  Offend them and Jon loses his army."
30012,ARYA:  Not if they lose their heads first.
30013,"SANSA:  Winterfell didn't just fall into our hands.  We took it back, and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale, all of us working together.  Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together."
30014,"ARYA:  And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support, so you can work together to give you what you really want."
30015,SANSA:  How can you even think such a horrible thing?
30016,"ARYA:  You're thinking it right now.  You don't want to be, but the thought just won't go away."
30017,NARRATOR:SANSA and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment.
30018,SANSA:  I have work to do.
30019,NARRATOR:SANSA turns and walks away from ARYA.
30020,ARYA:  My lady.
30021,NARRATOR:ARYA exits the room.
30022,NARRATOR:DAVOS and TYRION are standing on the beach of King's Landing.  DAVOS is securing a small row boat.  TYRION is looking up towards the city walls.
30023,TYRION:  Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow.
30024,DAVOS:  Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire.
30025,NARRATOR:TYRION turns to look at DAVOS.  DAVOS walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand.
30026,DAVOS:  There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.  The guards hardly ever patrol it.  Too many steps.
30027,NARRATOR:TYRION begins walking towards the path.  DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead.  TYRION stops and looks back towards the unattended boat.
30028,TYRION:  You're not staying here?
30029,DAVOS:  I've got my own business in Flea Bottom.
30030,TYRION:  What if someone takes the boat?
30031,DAVOS:  Then we're fucked.  Best hurry.
30032,NARRATOR:BRONN and JAIME are walking by the dragon skulls.  Both men have sparring swords in their hand.
30033,JAIME:  We don't have time for this.  We should be preparing the city for a siege.  The Dothraki are coming.
30034,BRONN:  All the more reason for you to train.  Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds.
30035,JAIME:  I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well.
30036,BRONN:  And here I am ready to train.
30037,JAIME:  Why down here?
30038,BRONN:  I don't think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet.
30039,JAIME:  Today might be the day I kill you by accident.
30040,"BRONN:  Oh, you won't be swinging it at me."
30041,NARRATOR:BRONN stops walking and holds his torch out.  TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME.  JAIME looks angrily at BRONN.
30042,BRONN:  I'll leave you to it.
30043,NARRATOR:BRONN turns and walks away leaving JAIME and TYRION alone.
30044,TYRION:  I needed to see you and I knew you'd never agree to meet.
30045,NARRATOR:JAIME remains silent and stares at TYRION.
30046,"TYRION:  You made me look like a complete fool.  I thought I'd surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock, but you were three steps ahead of me.  You abandoned the family home.  Completely unsentimental.  Father would have been proud."
30047,JAIME:  Don't talk about our father.
30048,TYRION:  Listen to me --
30049,JAIME:  I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again I'd cut you in half.
30050,NARRATOR:TYRION glances down at the sword in JAIME's hand.
30051,TYRION:  It would take you awhile with a sparring sword.
30052,NARRATOR:JAIME shakes his head and says nothing.
30053,"TYRION:  He was going to execute me.  He knew I was innocent.  He didn't hate me because of anything I did, he hated me because of what I am.  The little monster sent to punish him.  Do you think I wanted to be born this way?  Did he think I chose --"
30054,JAIME:  What do you want?
30055,TYRION:  Daenerys will win this war.  You're a military man.  You must know there is no way around it.  Daenerys is not her father.  She's even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.
30056,JAIME:  You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself.
30057,NARRATOR:Men are in the market selling their wares.  A blacksmith sharpens a sword on a grinding wheel.  DAVOS is walking through the market glancing around.  A man in a blacksmith shop pulls a sword from the fire and begins to hammer it on his anvil.  DAVOS walks into the shop.
30058,DAVOS:  I wasn't sure I'd find you.
30059,"NARRATOR:The blacksmith puts the sword down and turns around, revealing GENDRY, the bastard son of Robert Baratheon."
30060,DAVOS:  I thought you might still be rowing.
30061,NARRATOR:GENDRY chuckles and DAVOS smiles.
30062,"DAVOS:  I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.  I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel."
30063,GENDRY:  Weren't you worried about the Goldcloaks?
30064,DAVOS:  I haven't been here in years.  Why should they recognize me?  Sometimes I hardly do.  Nothing fucks you harder than time.
30065,"NARRATOR:DAVOS walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords.  He pulls one, nods in approval and puts it back in its place.  He turns back to GENDRY."
30066,DAVOS:  Anybody give you any trouble?
30067,GENDRY:  Here I am arming Lannisters.  I never get a second look.  You were right.  Safest place for me was right under the queen's nose.
30068,DAVOS:  Don't be so sure.  Safety is never a permanent state of affairs.  Bad things are coming.
30069,NARRATOR:GENDRY nods.
30070,GENDRY:  You came to get me.  You want me to come with you.
30071,DAVOS:  I think you need to understand --
30072,GENDRY:  I'm ready.  Let's go.
30073,DAVOS:  You should know what you're heading into.
30074,GENDRY:  Don't you think I've been thinking about it every swing of the hammer... how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father?  They tried to kill me.
30075,NARRATOR:GENDRY is tossing his tools and apron to the side.  He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head.
30076,"GENDRY:  I've been getting ready.  I never knew what for, but I've always known I'd know it when it comes."
30077,DAVOS:  You might want to bring one of those swords.
30078,NARRATOR:GENDRY smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons.
30079,"GENDRY:  I don't know much about swinging swords, but this --"
30080,NARRATOR:GENDRY removes a giant war hammer from the wall.
30081,NARRATOR:GENDRY and DAVOS turn and walk out of the shop.
30082,NARRATOR:DAVOS and GENDRY are walking towards the boat DAVOS left on the beach.
30083,DAVOS:  Keep your father's name to yourself.  The situation is complicated enough already.
30084,NARRATOR:GENDRY and DAVOS arrive at the boat.  GENDRY lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo.  DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope.  Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS and GENDRY.
30085,GENDRY:  Who should I say I am?
30086,NARRATOR:DAVOS turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat.  He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY.
30087,"DAVOS:  I told you, Clovis, if we don't get out of here soon someone is going to --"
30088,GUARD 1:  You there.
30089,NARRATOR:Both guards have their hands on their weapons ready to draw.  DAVOS starts walking towards the guards and spreads his cloak open.  GENDRY remains by the boat.
30090,"DAVOS:  No weapons, friends.  I promise.  What can I do for you?"
30091,GUARD 1:  Is that your boat?
30092,DAVOS:  It is.
30093,NARRATOR:GENDRY looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view.
30094,GUARD 2:  The docks are that way.
30095,GENDRY:  That they are.  I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves.
30096,NARRATOR:The two guards look at each other and chuckle.  DAVOS retrieves a coin purse and opens it.
30097,DAVOS:  Still five gold dragons?
30098,GUARD 1:  Are you joking?
30099,GUARD 2:  You must be even older than you look.  15.
30100,DAVOS:  15?
30101,GUARD 1:  Apiece.
30102,NARRATOR:DAVOS angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men.
30103,DAVOS:  I can't say it was a pleasure doing business with you.
30104,NARRATOR:DAVOS turns and begins walking back to his boat.
30105,GUARD 1:  What's in the boat?
30106,NARRATOR:DAVOS pauses and turns back to the guards.
30107,DAVOS:  Not more gold.
30108,GUARD 2:  Wine?
30109,GUARD 1:  Mmm.
30110,GUARD 2:  I like wine.
30111,GUARD 1:  Or hams.
30112,DAVOS:  Come and have a look.
30113,"NARRATOR:The guards walk over to the boat.  As they approach, DAVOS walks to the boat and pulls a cover to reveal the cargo.  As he pulls back the canvas, he throws it over GENDRY's exposed weapon covering it from view.  There are several baskets of fermented meat.  The guards twist their faces in disgust."
30114,DAVOS:  Fermented crab.
30115,GUARD 2:  What?
30116,"DAVOS:  Fermented crab.  One bucket of this triples the brothel's earnings for the week.  A man thinks he's done, he's ready to go back to his loving family, but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth.  Five minutes later, he's back in the race.  Here, have a taste."
30117,NARRATOR:DAVOS scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards.  Both men reach out and take a pinch.  The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth.  They both recoil from the taste and look at each other.
30118,DAVOS:  I'd hurry to your favorite establishment or you'll put a whole in that chainmail.
30119,NARRATOR:The guards and DAVOS laugh.  The guards turn and start walking back towards the city.  GENDRY nods at them as they go.  TYRION appears at the top of the stairs leading to the beach.  The Goldcloaks see him as he's walking down the path.  TYRION walks by the guards and they exchange glances.  The guards stop and turn back toward the boat.
30120,"GUARD 2:  Oi, Dwarf!"
30121,NARRATOR:DAVOS quickly walks to cut the guards off.
30122,DAVOS:  I really wouldn't try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you.
30123,GUARD 2:  That dwarf --
30124,NARRATOR:The guards blow past DAVOS and begin talking to TYRION.
30125,GUARD 1:  Where did you get that scar?
30126,TYRION:  Fish hook.  Some men you just can't teach.
30127,GUARD 2:  We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back.
30128,NARRATOR:DAVOS is still standing behind the guards.  He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it.
30129,DAVOS:  Perhaps there's some arrangement?
30130,NARRATOR:The two guards turn back to DAVOS.
30131,GUARD 2:  Arrangement?  You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei?
30132,"NARRATOR:GENDRY can be seen behind the backs of the guards.  He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2.  He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guard's head.  The man drops.  As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer, GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face."
30133,NARRATOR:DAVOS is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY.
30134,DAVOS:  This is Gendry.
30135,TYRION:  He'll do.
30136,NARRATOR:The men grab onto the boat and begin to push it into the water.
30137,NARRATOR:JAIME opens the door and step into the queen's room.  CERSEI is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN.
30138,CERSEI:  That won't be necessary.
30139,NARRATOR:QYBURN bows his head and walks to leave the room.  As he passes by JAIME he addresses him.
30140,QYBURN:  Ser Jaime.
30141,NARRATOR:QYBURN closes the door as he leaves.  JAIME and CERSEI are alone.  CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front of JAIME and sits.
30142,JAIME:  Why was QYBURN here?
30143,CERSEI:  He's Hand of the Queen.  Why are you here?
30144,JAIME:  I met with Tyrion.
30145,NARRATOR:CERSEI pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable.
30146,CERSEI:  What did our brother have to say?
30147,JAIME:  Daenerys wants to meet.
30148,CERSEI:  To discuss a surrender?
30149,JAIME:  To discuss an armistice.
30150,CERSEI:  She just won a great victory.  Why would she want a truce now?
30151,JAIME:  Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms.  Tyrion claims he'll have proof.
30152,NARRATOR:CERSEI smirks and looks away from JAIME.
30153,CERSEI:  Are you going to punish him?
30154,JAIME:  Tyrion?
30155,CERSEI:  Bronn.
30156,NARRATOR:JAIME looks confused.
30157,CERSEI:  He betrayed you.  He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent.  Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing?
30158,NARRATOR:JAIME shakes his head.
30159,JAIME:  You let it happen.  Why?
30160,"CERSEI:  I've come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest.  She has the numbers.  If we want to beat her we have to be clever.  We have to fight her like father would have.  Dead men, dragons and Dragon Queens, whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house.  For this."
30161,NARRATOR:CERSEI lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating she's pregnant.  JAIME looks shocked.
30162,JAIME:  Who will you say is the father?
30163,CERSEI:  You.
30164,JAIME:  People won't like that.
30165,NARRATOR:CERSEI stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME.
30166,CERSEI:  Do you remember what father used to say about people?
30167,JAIME:  The lion doesn't concern himself with the opinions of the sheep.
30168,NARRATOR:JAIME reaches forward and takes CERSEI and kisses her.  While they embrace CERSEI speaks to JAIME.
30169,CERSEI:  Never betray me again.
30170,NARRATOR:GENDRY and DAVOS are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave.  Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave.  DAVOS and GENDRY are having a discussion.
30171,DAVOS:  We're leaving today.  The king's got a lot on his mind.
30172,GENDRY:  I understand.
30173,DAVOS:  He doesn't need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king.
30174,GENDRY:  You don't have to worry.
30175,"DAVOS:  You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges."
30176,GENDRY:  Understood.
30177,NARRATOR:DAVOS and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave.  JON is walking along the corridor.
30178,"DAVOS:  Begging your pardon, Your Grace."
30179,NARRATOR:JON stops and turns around to face DAVOS.
30180,JON:  You survived King's Landing.
30181,DAVOS:  Yet again.
30182,"JON:  Your Grace, this is --"
30183,NARRATOR:GENDRY steps forward in front of DAVOS.
30184,"GENDRY:  It's Gendry, Your Grace.  I'm Robert Baratheon's son.  Bastard son."
30185,NARRATOR:JON looks to DAVOS.
30186,DAVOS:  He was meant to keep that to himself.
30187,GENDRY:  Our fathers trusted each other.  Why shouldn't we?
30188,JON:  I saw your father once at Winterfell.
30189,GENDRY:  I met yours in my shop.
30190,JON:  You're a lot leaner.
30191,GENDRY:  You're a lot shorter.
30192,NARRATOR:JON stops smiling and pauses a moment.  Then he chuckles.
30193,JON:  I grew up on stories about them.
30194,"GENDRY:  All I ever knew was they fought together and won.  Ser Davos told me where you're going, Your Grace, and why.  Let me come with you."
30195,DAVOS:  Don't be a fool.  You're not a soldier.
30196,"GENDRY:  No, but I'm a fighter.  And he won't be needing a smith with a sword like that."
30197,JON:  Do you know how to use one?
30198,NARRATOR:GENDRY shakes his head.
30199,"JON:  Well, that's a problem."
30200,GENDRY:  I prefer a hammer.
30201,NARRATOR:GENDRY looks to DAVOS.
30202,DAVOS:  He can handle himself.
30203,NARRATOR:JON nods.
30204,JON:  We could use the help.
30205,"DAVOS:  As my father used to say, it's better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life."
30206,"GENDRY(to DAVOS):  I owe you my life.  Twice over.  But if what you said is true about what's out there, I can't wait out this war."
30207,DAVOS:  Yeah.  Nobody mind me.  All I've ever done is live to a ripe old age.
30208,NARRATOR:Two landing boats are sitting on the beach surrounded by two groups of men.  A large sailboat is anchored in the bay.  JORAH places his sword and a case of Dragonglass into the boat.  TYRION walks down the beach and stands next to JORAH.
30209,"TYRION:  You may not believe it, but I've missed you Mormont.  Nobody glowers quite like you.  Not even Grey Worm."
30210,NARRATOR:TYRION retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands.
30211,TYRION:  This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us.  Remember?
30212,JORAH:  It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives.
30213,NARRATOR:TYRION smiles and hands the coin to JORAH.
30214,TYRION:  Take it with you.  You'll bring it back.  Our queen needs you.
30215,NARRATOR:JORAH nods to TYRION.  DAENERYS appears and walks up to JORAH.
30216,DAENERYS:  We should be better at saying farewell by now.
30217,"JORAH:  Your Grace, I --"
30218,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands.  JON SNOW, DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats.  JORAH bends and kisses DAENERY's hand.  He turns and continues readying the boat.  JON stands in front of DAENERYS."
30219,JON:  If I don't return at least you won't have to deal with the King in the North anymore.
30220,NARRATOR:DAENERYS smiles.
30221,DAENERYS:  But I've grown used to him.
30222,"JON:  I wish you good fortune in the wars to come, Your Grace."
30223,NARRATOR:DAENERYS nods to JON.  JON turns and walks to the head of the boat.  The men take hold of it.
30224,JON:  Heave!
30225,NARRATOR:The men push the boat into the sea.  DAENERYS and TYRION remain on the beach watching them go.
30226,NARRATOR:SAM is seated at a table surround by papers and candles.  He is writing notes into a book.  Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome.  SAM JR. is playing on the bed.
30227,GILLY:  Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel?
30228,SAM:  No.
30229,"GILLY:  15,782."
30230,NARRATOR:SAM looks up from his work annoyed.  He remains silent and continues working.
30231,GILLY:  Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor.
30232,NARRATOR:SAMWELL looks away and pauses.
30233,SAMWELL:  None anymore.
30234,"GILLY:  That's true.  This High Septon Meynard, he recorded everything.  He even recorded his own bowel movements.  What does ""annulment"" mean?"
30235,SAMWELL:  It's when a man sets asside his lawful wife.
30236,GILLY:  Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne.  Is that a common thing --
30237,NARRATOR:SAMWELL isn't paying much attention to GILLY.  He loudly interrupts her.
30238,"SAMWELL:  These maesters, they set me to the task of preserving that man's window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night King's probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored.  But that's all right, isn't it.  We could all become slavering, murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynard's 15,782 shits."
30239,GILLY:  Steps.  That number was steps.
30240,NARRATOR:SAMWELL is dismayed.  He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr.  He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door.
30241,"NARRATOR:SAM is walking through a dark library.  He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate.  He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel.  After retrieving what he needs, SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library.  He pauses before he leaves and turns around.  He glances back at the library.  It is many stories tall lined with countless  shelves of books.  SAMWELL looks at the library one last time, turns and walks out of the door."
30242,CUT TO:  EXT. CITADEL
30243,NARRATOR:SAMWELL is loading a wagon with his things.  He walks around to the driver seat.  GILLY and SAM JR. are already in the wagon dressed for the road.  SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand.
30244,GILLY:  Are you sure you want to do this?  You always wanted to be a maester.
30245,SAMWELL:  I'm tired of reading about the achievements of better men.
30246,NARRATOR:The horse neighs and begins pulling the carriage away from the city.  The Citadel can be seen with a torch burning bright on top of the tallest tower.
30247,NARRATOR:ARYA is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation.  The servent is whispering in BAELISH's ear.  ARYA can't hear the conversation.  ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll.  The servant turns to leave.  BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished.  BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels.
30248,NARRATOR:ARYA is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH.  He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE.  She can't hear what's being said.  BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men.  ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH.
30249,"NARRATOR:ARYA is walking down the hallway.  She pauses, peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISH's quarters.  BAELISH appears and unlocks his door.  Before he walks in MAESTER WOLKAN approaches him.  She continues watching the men."
30250,"WOLKAN:  I found it, my Lord."
30251,NARRATOR:WOLKAN hands BAELISH a raven scroll.
30252,WOLKAN:  It took some searching.  Maester Llewyn's archives are thorough.
30253,NARRATOR:BAELISH reads the note then looks at WOLKAN.
30254,BAELISH:  Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell?
30255,"WOLKAN:  Yes, my Lord."
30256,BAELISH:  Lady Stark thanks you for your service.
30257,"NARRATOR:WOLKAN turns and walks away.  BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door.  ARYA continues watching.  A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room, locking the door as he leaves.  After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve.  She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll.  She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value.  She checks another cabinet, then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing.  She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding.  She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll.  She unrolls it and reads the contents."
30258,"""Robb, I write to you with a heavy heart. Our good king Robert is dead, killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt. Father has been charged with treason. He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne. The Lannisters are treating me very well and provide me with every comfort. I beg you: come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark. Your faithfull sister, Sansa."""
30259,"NARRATOR:Arya rerolls the note and exits the room.  She locks the door behind her and leaves the hallway.  After a moment BAELISH emerges from a dark corner, watching ARYA with a smirk on his face."
30260,NARRATOR:JON and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch.  JON looks up at the castle.  The men collect their equipment and make for the castle.
30261,"NARRATOR:TORMUND, JON, DAVOS, GENDRY, and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation."
30262,TORMUND:  Isn't it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this?
30263,DAVOS:  I've been failing at that job of late.
30264,TORMUND:  How many queens are there now?
30265,JON:  Two.
30266,TORMUND:  And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?
30267,JON:  Both.
30268,TORMUND:  How many men did you bring?
30269,NARRATOR:JON looks around the table.
30270,JON:  Not enough.
30271,TORMUND:  The big woman?
30272,NARRATOR:JON smiles and shakes his head.  TORMUND is disappointed.
30273,JORAH:  We were hoping some of your men could help.
30274,DAVOS:  I'll be staying behind.  I'm a liability out there as you well know.
30275,NARRATOR:TORMUND nods his head.
30276,TORMUND:  You are.
30277,NARRATOR:TORMUND turns to look at JON.
30278,TORMUND:  You really want to go out there again?
30279,NARRATOR:JON nods.
30280,TORMUND:  You're not the only ones.
30281,NARRATOR:The raiding party walk down to the Eastwatch cells.  TORMUND is leading them.
30282,TORMUND:  My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall.  Said they were on their way here.
30283,"NARRATOR:The men look into the cells.  It is occupied by SANDOR CLEGANE, THOROS of MYR, and BERIC DONDARRION."
30284,JON:  You're The Hound.  I saw you once at Winterfell.
30285,NARRATOR:SANDOR pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on.
30286,TORMUND:  They want to go beyond the Wall too.
30287,"BERIC:  We don't want to go beyond the Wall, we have to.  Our lord told us the great war is coming."
30288,GENDRY:  Don't trust them.  Don't trust any of them.
30289,NARRATOR:The men turn to look at GENDRY.  GENDRY walks up and presses his face to the bars of the cell.
30290,GENDRY:  They're the Brotherhood.  And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered.
30291,JORAH:  Thoros?
30292,NARRATOR:THOROS sits up from a dark corner.
30293,JORAH:  I hardly recognized you.
30294,THOROS:  Ser Jorah Mormont --
30295,NARRATOR:TORMUND turns and angrily looks at JORAH.
30296,THOROS:  They won't give me anything to drink down here.  I haven't been feeling like myself.
30297,TORMUND:  You're a fucking Mormont?  Like the last Lord Commander?
30298,JORAH:  He was my father.
30299,TORMUND:  He hunted us like animals.
30300,"JORAH:  You returned the favor, as I recall."
30301,BERIC:  Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason.
30302,DAVOS:  Our reasons aren't your reasons.
30303,BERIC:  It doesn't matter what we think our reasons are.
30304,NARRATOR:BERIC stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell.
30305,BERIC:  There's a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not.  We may take the steps but the Lord of Light --
30306,"SANDOR:  For fuck's sake, will you shut your hole.  Are we coming with you or not?"
30307,JORAH:  Don't you want to know what we're doing?
30308,THOROS:  Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die?
30309,JON:  He's right.  We're all on the same side.
30310,GENDRY:  How can we be?
30311,JON:  We're all breathing.
30312,NARRATOR:TORMUND hands the cell keys to JON.  JON opens the door and let the men out.
30313,"NARRATOR:The ranger gate opens and the raiding party consisting of TORMUND, JON, GENDRY, THOROS, SANDOR, JORAH and BERIC stand at the edge of the true north.  There is a blizzard raging and snow blows over the tundra.  JON looks back at the party and the men glance at each other.  THOROS drinks from a flask of wine.  JON looks back to the north and the men begin marching into the wild.  A group of Wildlings pull a sled loaded with equipment behind the raiding party.  The men disappear into the white of the blizzard."
30314,NARRATOR:END CREDITS
30315,NARRATOR:Script in progress
30316,"NARRATOR:The camera floats over the painted table showing detailed carvings of rivers, holdfasts, and cities.  A fire burns in the hearth."
30317,CUT TO:  BEYOND THE WALL
30318,"NARRATOR:A raiding party consisting of JON SNOW, TORMUND, GENDRY BRATHEON, JORAH MORMONT, SANDOR CLEGANE, BERIC DONDARRIAN, THOROS of MYR and several Wildlings are ranging beyond the wall of Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.  The men trek through a frozen valley filled with jagged rocks.  The Wildlings are pulling a sled loaded with gear and provisions.  The camera shifts and the men are climbing a steep mountain covered in snow."
30319,JON(to Gendry):  Are you all right?
30320,NARRATOR:GENDRY faces JON and grunts.
30321,JON:  Ever been north before?
30322,GENDRY:  Never seen snow before.
30323,"TORMUND:  Beautiful, eh?  I can breath again.  Down south the air smells like pig shit."
30324,JON:  You've never been down south.
30325,TORMUND:  I've been to Winterfell.
30326,JON:  That's the north.
30327,NARRATOR:The group of men continue north.  A Wildling scout is ahead of the group surveying the area.
30328,GENDRY(to TORMUND):  How do you live up here?  How do you keep your balls from freezing off?
30329,"TORMUND:  You have to keep moving.  That's the secret.  Walking is good, fighting is better, fucking is best."
30330,JON:  There's not another woman within 100 miles of here.
30331,NARRATOR:TORMUND turns to look at JON and GENDRY.
30332,TORMUND:  We have to make due with what we've got.
30333,NARRATOR:JON glances at GENDRY.  GENDRY backs away from JON and TORMUND.
30334,TORMUND:  This one is maybe not so smart.
30335,JON:  Davos says he is a strong fighter.
30336,TORMUND:  Good.  That's more important than being smart.
30337,NARRATOR:TORMUND looks at JON as they continue to walk.
30338,"TORMUND:  Smart people don't come up here looking for the dead.  So, you met this Dragon Queen, huh?  And?"
30339,JON:  She'll only fight beside us if I bend the knee.
30340,"TORMUND:  You spent too much time with the free folk and now you don't like kneeling.  Mance Rayder was a great man, a proud man.  The king beyond the wall never bent the knee.  How many of his people died for his pride?"
30341,"NARRATOR:The camera pans out to a frozen vista.  The men are walking across broken slabs of ice and tundra.  There are mountains and a lake of ice in the distance.  The view shifts to GENDRY walking along with THOROS, BERIC and SANDOR.  THOROS is carrying his wine flask."
30342,"THOROS:  Are you still mad at us, boy?"
30343,GENDRY:  You sold me to a witch.
30344,"THOROS:  Priestess.  I'll admit, it is a subtle distinction."
30345,BERIC:  We're fighting a great war.  Wars cost money.
30346,"GENDRY:  I wanted to be one of you.  I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave.  Do you know what she did to me?  She strapped me down on a bed, she stripped me naked --"
30347,SANDOR:  Sounds all right so far.
30348,SANDOR:  Was she naked too?
30349,THOROS:  She needed your blood.
30350,GENDRY:  Yes. Thank you.  I know that.
30351,NARRATOR:SANDOR steps in front of GENDRY to halt him.
30352,SANDOR:  It could have been worse.
30353,GENDRY:  She wanted to kill me.  They would have killed me if it wasn't for Davos --
30354,"SANDOR:  But they didn't, did they?  So what you whinging about?"
30355,GENDRY:  I'm not whinging.
30356,SANDOR:  Your lips are moving and you're complaining about something.  That's whinging.
30357,NARRATOR:SANDOR motions to BERIC.
30358,SANDOR:  This one's been killed six times.  You don't hear him bitching about it.
30359,NARRATOR:SANDOR walks away to join the group.  BERIC and THOROS smile to each other.  THOROS holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back to THOROS.
30360,THOROS:  Good lad.
30361,NARRATOR:The camera shifts to the head of the line.  JON is walking with JORAH.
30362,JON:  The first time I went north of the wall was with your father.
30363,JORAH:  He was a good man.  He deserved a better son.  Were you with him at the end?
30364,JON:  I was a prisoner of the Wildlings.  But we avenged him.  I want you to know that every mutineer found justice.
30365,"JORAH:  I can't think of a worse way for him to go.  The Night's Watch was his life.  He would have died to protect every one of those men, and they butchered him."
30366,JON:  I hate that he died that way.  My father was the most honorable man I ever met.  He was good all the way through.  And he died on the executioner's block.
30367,JORAH:  Your father wanted to execute me.
30368,JON:  I heard.
30369,JORAH:  He was in the right of course.  It didn't make me hate him any less.
30370,NARRATOR:JORAH and JON glance at each other.
30371,JON:  I'm glad he didn't capture you.
30372,JORAH:  Me too.
30373,NARRATOR:JON stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword.
30374,"JON:  Your father gave me this sword.  He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf, but it's still Long Claw."
30375,NARRATOR:JON hands the sword to JORAH.  JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands.
30376,JON:  Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.
30377,NARRATOR:JORAH stops examining the sword and looks up to JON.
30378,JON:  But you are back and it's been in your family for centuries.  It's not right for me to have it.
30379,"NARRATOR:JORAH pauses, then nods at JON."
30380,JORAH:  He gave it to you.
30381,JON:  I'm not his son.
30382,"NARRATOR:JORAH pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade, turning it in his hands."
30383,JORAH:  I brought shame to my house.  I broke my father's heart.
30384,NARRATOR:JORAH resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON.
30385,JORAH:  I forfeited the right to claim this sword.  It's yours.  May it serve you well and your children after you.
30386,NARRATOR:Snow is falling into the courtyard.  The ground is covered with several inches of snow.  Several braziers are burning and a servant carries a bucket of steaming water across the grounds.  ARYA is standing on the upper level looking into the courtyard.  SANSA approaches her from behind.
30387,ARYA:  Father used to watch us from up here.  He wouldn't say much.  You probably don't remember.  You were inside knitting all the time.
30388,SANSA:  I remember.
30389,"ARYA:  One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick.  I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground.  Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw.  There was one arrow in the target.  There was no one around, just like now.  No one to stop me.  So I started shooting.  And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again.  I wasn't very good.  Finally I hit the bullseye.  It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th.  I don't remember.  But I hit the bullseye and I heard this."
30390,NARRATOR:ARYA starts a slow clap.
30391,ARYA:  I looked up and he's standing right here smiling down at me.  I knew what I was doing was against the rules.  But he was smiling so I knew it wasn't wrong.  The rules were wrong.  I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.  Now he's dead.  Killed by the Lannisters with your help.
30392,NARRATOR:SANSA turns to look at ARYA.
30393,SANSA:  What?
30394,NARRATOR:ARYA retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it.
30395,"ARYA:  That's your pretty handwriting.  Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldn't write as well as you.  ""Robb, I write to you today with heavy heart.  Our good King Robert is dead.  Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt --"
30396,SANSA:  You don't have to read it.  I remember.
30397,"ARYA:  ""Father has been charged with treason.  He conspired with Robert's brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne.  The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort.  I beg you, come to King's Landing, swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark.  Your faithful sister, Sansa."""
30398,SANSA:  They forced me to do it.
30399,ARYA:  Did they.  With a knife at your throat?  Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop?
30400,SANSA:  You don't know what it was like.  I was a child.
30401,ARYA:  So was I.  I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family.
30402,SANSA:  They told me it was the only way to save father.
30403,ARYA:  And you were stupid enough to believe them.  I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block.  I remember the pretty dress you were wearing.  I remember the fancy way you did your hair.
30404,SANSA:  You were there?
30405,ARYA:  I was there standing in the crowd near Baelor's statue.
30406,SANSA:  And what did you do?  Did you come running to the rescue?  Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father?
30407,ARYA:  I wanted to.
30408,SANSA:  But you didn't.  Just like me.
30409,ARYA:  I didn't betray him.  I didn't betray Robb.  I didn't betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey.
30410,"SANSA:  You should be on your knees thanking me.  We're standing in Winterfell again because of me.  You didn't win it back.  Jon didn't win it back.  He lost the Battle of the Bastards.  The Knight's of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where, traveling the world?"
30411,ARYA:  I was training.
30412,"SANSA:  Training.  Well, while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine."
30413,"ARYA:  Oh, I don't know about that.  I can imagine quite a lot."
30414,SANSA:  You never would have survived what I survived.
30415,ARYA:  I guess we'll never know.
30416,SANSA:  What are you doing to do with that letter.
30417,ARYA:  I don't know yet.
30418,SANSA:  Who did you show it to?  Where did you find it?
30419,"ARYA:  You're scared, aren't you?  What are you scared of?  You didn't commit any crimes.  No one's going to hang you."
30420,SANSA:  Arya --
30421,ARYA:  Are you scared I'll show it to Jon and he'll be angry?  No.  That's not Jon.  He'll understand.  You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters.
30422,"SANSA:  Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting?  This is exactly what she wants.  This is what she's always wanted, to tear us apart --"
30423,"ARYA:  The northern lords will read it.  They wouldn't think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cersei's bidding.  What would little Lyanna Mormont say?  She's younger than you were when you wrote this.  Are you going to say, ""But I was just a child""?"
30424,SANSA:  You're angry.  Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things.
30425,ARYA:  Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things.  I'll go with anger.
30426,NARRATOR:ARYA turns and walks away.
30427,NARRATOR:The raiding party are marching single file acorss the frozen tundra.  SANDOR stops to tie a fur cover over his boot that came loose.  TORMUND approaches him.
30428,TORMUND:  You’re the one they call the dog.
30429,SANDOR:  Fuck off.
30430,TORMUND:  They told me you were mean.  Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings?
30431,SANDOR:  I don't give two shits about Wildlings.
30432,NARRATOR:SANDOR looks up at TORMUND.
30433,SANDOR:  Gingers I hate.
30434,TORMUND:  Gingers are beautiful.  We are kissed by fire.  Just like you.
30435,NARRATOR:TORMUND points and motions to SANDOR's burned face.  SANDOR slaps his hand away.
30436,SANDOR:  Don't point your fucking finger at me.
30437,NARRATOR:SANDOR walks away to rejoin the group.  TORMUND begins smiling and walks after him.
30438,TORMUND:  Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby?
30439,SANDOR:  I didn't trip.  I was pushed.
30440,TORMUND:  Ever since you've been mean.
30441,SANDOR:  Will you fuck off?
30442,TORMUND:  I don't think you're truly mean.  You have sad eyes.
30443,NARRATOR:SANDOR stops and turns to TORMUND.
30444,SANDOR:  Do you want to suck my dick?  Is that it?
30445,TORMUND:  Dick?
30446,SANDOR:  Cock.
30447,TORMUND:  Ah.  Dick.  I like it.
30448,SANDOR:  I bet you do.
30449,"NARRATOR:SANDOR turns and begins walking, TORMUND follows."
30450,TORMUND:  Nope.  It's pussy for me.  I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell.  If I ever get back there.  Yellow hair.  Blue eyes.  Tallest woman you've ever seen.  Almost as tall as you.
30451,NARRATOR:SANDOR stops and glances at TORMUND.
30452,SANDOR:  Brienne of Tarth.
30453,TORMUND:  You know her?
30454,SANDOR:  You're with Brienne of fucking Tarth?
30455,"TORMUND:  Well, not with her yet, but I see the way she looks at me."
30456,SANDOR:  How does she look at you?  Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver?
30457,NARRATOR:TORMUND nods.
30458,TORMUND:  You do know her.
30459,SANDOR:  We've met.
30460,NARRATOR:SANDOR and TORMUND begin walking.
30461,TORMUND:  I want to make babies with her.  Think of the great big monsters.  They'd conquer the world.
30462,SANDOR:  How did a mad fucker like you live this long?
30463,TORMUND:  I'm good at killing people.
30464,NARRATOR:The camera shifts to the middle of the line.  JON and BERIC are walking together.
30465,BERIC:  You don't much look like him.
30466,JON:  Who's that?
30467,BERIC:  Your father.  I suppose you favor your mother.
30468,JON:  You knew him?
30469,BERIC:  Of course I did.  When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain.  Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back.  Thoros has brought me back six times.  We both serve the same lord.
30470,JON:  I serve the north.
30471,BERIC:  The north didn't raise you from the dead.
30472,JON:  The lord of light never spoke to me.  I don't know anything about him.  I don't know what he wants from me.
30473,BERIC:  He wants you alive.
30474,JON:  Why?
30475,BERIC:  I don't know.
30476,"JON:  That's all anyone can tell me, I don't know.  So what's the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants."
30477,BERIC:  I think about that all the time.  I don't think it's our purpose to understand except one thing.  We're soldiers.  We have to know what we're fighting for.  I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords.
30478,JON:  So what are you fighting for?
30479,BERIC:  Life.  Death is the enemy.  The first enemy and the last.
30480,JON:  But we all die.
30481,BERIC:  The enemy always wins.  And we still need to fight him.  That's all I know.  You and I wont find much joy while we're here.  But we can keep others alive.  We can defend those who can't defend themselves.
30482,"JON:  ""I am the shield that guards the realms of men."""
30483,BERIC:  Maybe we don't need to understand any more than that.  Maybe that's enough.
30484,JON:  Aye.  Maybe that's enough.
30485,NARRATOR:SANDOR stops and looks into the distance.  There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance.
30486,SANDOR:  That's what I saw in the fire.
30487,NARRATOR:SANDOR points towards the mountain.
30488,SANDOR:  A mountain like an arrowhead.
30489,THOROS:  Are you sure?
30490,NARRATOR:SANDOR turns to THOROS and nods his head.
30491,SANDOR:  We're getting close.

30493,NARRATOR:TYRION is sitting in a chair staring into the fire.  DAENERYS stands across the room next to the painted table.
30494,DAENERYS:  Do you know what I like about you?
30495,NARRATOR:TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS.
30496,TYRION:  I honestly don't.
30497,DAENERYS:  You're not a hero.
30498,TYRION:  Oh.  I've been heroic on occasion.
30499,NARRATOR:DAENERYS walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite from TYRION.
30500,TYRION:  I once charged through the mud gate of King's Landing.
30501,"DAENERYS:  I don't want you to be a hero.  Heroes do stupid things and they die.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist, bravest thing."
30502,"TYRION:  It's interesting these heroes you name.  Drogo, Jorah, Dario, even this Jon Snow, they all fell in love with you."
30503,DAENERYS:  Jon Snow's not in love with me.
30504,"TYRION:  Oh, my mistake.  I suppose he stares at you longingly because he's hopeful for a successful military alliance."

30506,"NARRATOR:GREY WORM and the Unsullied stand in formation in front of King's Landing. JAIME and the Lannister forces survey them from atop the rampart. BRONN walks the length of the rampart, overseeing the men."
30507,"NARRATOR:The camera shifts to a courtyard. The soldiers work, boiling pitch, filling barrels and rolling them up to the defensive wall."
30508,BRONN: Oil?
30509,"SOLDIER: Pitch, my lord."
30510,BRONN: How many barrels?
30511,"SOLDIER: 500, my lord."
30512,BRONN: Get 500 more.
30513,"SOLDIER:  Yes, my lord."
30514,NARRATOR:The soldier exits and BRONN walks the wall to JAIME
30515,"BRONN: I still enjoy it when they call me ""my lord."""
30516,JAIME: The thrill will fade.
30517,BRONN: If we live that long. Men without cocks. You wouldn't find me fighting in an army if I had no cock. What's left to fight for?
30518,JAIME: Gold?
30519,BRONN: I spent my life around soldiers. What do you think they spend that gold on?
30520,JAIME: Family.
30521,"BRONN: Not without a cock, you don't."
30522,JAIME: Maybe it really is all cocks in the end.
30523,"BRONN: Yet, your brother--"
30524,"JAIME: Yes, he's always been a champion of the downtrodden."
30525,"NARRATOR:A trumpet blares. Men howl and whoop in the distance, accompanied by thundering hoofbeats. The Dothraki crest the hill behind the disciplined unsullied army. They are savage and shrieking. They ride through and past the Unsullied."

30533,JON:  How many people live here?
30534,"TYRION: A million, give or take."
30535,JON: That's more people than the entire North crammed into that. Why would anyone want to live that way?
30536,TYRION: There's more work in the city. And the brothels are far superior.

30538,"NARRATOR:SANDOR descends a staircase into a dark hold, bearing a lantern. He advances carefully and stops at a crate. He gives one knock, and the WIGHT screeches in a frenzy, shaking his crate prison. Satisfied that the WIGHT lives, SANDOR turns and exits."

30552,MISSANDEI: Why did they build it?
30553,"JORAH: Dragons don't understand the difference between what is theirs and what isn't. Land, livestock, children... Letting them roam free around a city was a problem."
30554,"TYRION: I imagine it was a sad joke at the end. An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs. But in the beginning, when it was home to Balerion the Dread, it must have been the most dangerous place in the world."
30555,"NARRATOR:Lannister guards approach, led by BRONN and accompanied by BRIENNE and PODRICK."
30556,DAVOS: Maybe it still is.
30557,"BRONN: Welcome, my lords. Your friends arrived before you did."

30561,TYRION: A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation.
30562,"PODRICK: I never thought I'd see you again, my lord."
30563,"TYRION: Supporting the enemy, no less."
30564,PODRICK: Hard to blame you.
30565,TYRION: Cersei will anyway.
30566,PODRICK: I'm glad you're alive.
30567,BRONN: Come on! You can suck his magic cock later.

30573,BRIENNE: I thought you were dead.
30574,SANDOR: Not yet. You came pretty close.
30575,BRIENNE: I was only trying to protect her.
30576,SANDOR: You and me both.
30577,BRIENNE: She's alive. Arya.
30578,SANDOR: Where?
30579,BRIENNE: Winterfell.
30580,SANDOR: Who's protecting her if you're here?
30581,BRIENNE: The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way.
30582,SANDOR: It won't be me.
30583,NARRATOR:The camera shifts forward as they travel to the meeting.
30584,TYRION: Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay. Strange place for a reunion.
30585,"PODRICK: It is, my lord."
30586,"TYRION: I don't think I'm anyone's lord anymore, Podrick. Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater."
30587,BRONN: I'm sure your new queen--
30588,TYRION: You've been thinking about our new queen.
30589,"VARYS: And that would be double what now, exactly?"
30590,BRONN: Don't you worry about me. I'm doing all right. Looking after myself.
30591,"TYRION: Are you? Helping me to arrange this meeting wasn't exactly looking after yourself, was it? You put yourself at risk."
30592,"BRONN: I put yourself at risk. Important difference. It's your head Queen Cersei's offered a bag of gold for, it's not mine. Now, thanks to me, she's got two traitors' heads coming right through her door. She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes. All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater. If that's not looking after myself, I don't know what is."
30593,TYRION: It's good to see you again.
30594,"BRONN: Yeah, you, too."

30600,"BRONN: Come on, Pod. Let's you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk, eh?"
30601,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE gives her permission to PODRICK, who exits with BRONN. JON watches them go."
30602,NARRATOR:JORAH and TYRION look around. SANDOR paces.
30603,SANDOR: I left this shit city because I didn't want to die in it. Am I going to die in this shit city?
30604,TYRION: You might.
30605,SANDOR: And this is all your idea. Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it.
30606,TYRION: And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through.
30607,"NARRATOR:CERSEI enters with the MOUNTAIN, QYBURN, EURON and JAIME. JON and CERSEI exchange glances. So do BRIENNE and JAIME, CERSEI and TYRION, EURON and THEON. The royal party seats themselves, and SANDOR and the MOUNTAIN exchange looks. The Cleganes walk to confront one another before the dais."
30608,"SANDOR: Remember me? Yeah, you do. You're even fucking uglier than I am now. What did they do to you? Doesn't matter. That's not how it ends for you, brother."
30609,"NARRATOR:SANDOR walks away. The MOUNTAIN watches him go, then takes his place behind Cersei."
30610,CERSEI: Where is she?
30611,TYRION: She'll be here soon.
30612,CERSEI: Didn't travel with you?
30613,TYRION: No.
30614,"NARRATOR:Everyone waits. Then, dragons screech. JAIME and EURON stand to watch the dragons arrive.  Drogon lands powerfully next to the stage and roars. TYRION turns to look at CERSEI. JON and DAVOS look on as Drogon roars again, lowering his head to reveal DAENERYS on his back. Drogon climbs down to the dragon pit, and DAENERYS dismounts. She walks to the dais as Drogon flies away. DAENERYS and CERSEI eye one another as she takes her seat next to TYRION."
30615,CERSEI: We've been here for some time.
30616,DAENERYS: My apologies.
30617,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks to TYRION, who stands in response."
30618,TYRION: We are all facing a unique
30619,EURON: Theon! I have your sister
30620,NARRATOR:TYRION and JAIME exchange confused glances. JAIME shakes TYRION off.
30621,TYRION: I think we ought to begin with larger concerns.
30622,EURON: Then why are you talking? You're the smallest concern here.
30623,NARRATOR:EURON walks towards TYRION.
30624,TYRION: Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes? His wasn't even good. He explained it at the end. Never explain. It always ruins it.
30625,"EURON: We don't even let your kind live in the Iron Islands, you know? We kill you at birth. An act of mercy for the parents."
30626,JAIME: Perhaps you ought to sit down.
30627,EURON: Why?
30628,CERSEI: Sit down or leave.
30629,"NARRATOR:The MOUNTAIN moves forward, threatening to enforce CERSEI's will. EURON laughs and returns to his seat. THEON watches silently."
30630,"TYRION: We are a group of people who do not like one another, as this recent demonstration has shown. We have suffered at each other's hands. We have lost people we love at each other's hands. If all we wanted was more of the same, there would be no need for this gathering. We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting face-to-face."
30631,"CERSEI: So instead, we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days?"
30632,TYRION: We all know that will never happen.
30633,CERSEI: Then why are we here?
30634,NARRATOR:JON rises and walks forward to make his case.
30635,JON: This isn't about living in harmony. It's just about living. The same thing is coming for all of us. A general you can't negotiate with. An army that doesn't leave corpses behind on the battlefield. Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city. They're about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead.
30636,CERSEI: I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement.
30637,JON: This is serious. I wouldn't be here if it weren't.
30638,"CERSEI: I don't think it's serious at all. I think it's another bad joke. If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly, you're asking me for a truce."
30639,DAENERYS: Yes. That's all.
30640,CERSEI: That's all? Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt. Or while you solidify and expand your position. Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men.
30641,DAENERYS: Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with. You have my word.
30642,CERSEI: The word of a would-be usurper.
30643,TYRION: There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years. We have something to show you.
30644,"NARRATOR:SANDOR returns, bearing the crate on his back. He puts it down, removes the chains and bars that lock it. He removes the lid, and stands back in caution, grasping the hilt of his sword. Nothing happens. He kicks over the crate to reveal the WIGHT, who charges towards CERSEI, screeching horribly. SANDOR follows, while the WIGHT reaches for the frozen CERSEI. At the last minute, SANDOR pulls the chain that binds him, yanking the WIGHT off of its feet.  JAIME and the MOUNTAIN stand to protect CERSEI. The WIGHT turns its attention to SANDOR. He draws his sword, and slices the WIGHT in half as it attacks him. Both halves of the WIGHT continue to move. The upper half crawls towards SANDOR, who slices away a forearm. QYBURN picks up the undead arm to examine it. JON takes it, and with Davos's help, lights a torch."
30645,JON:  We can destroy them by burning them.
30646,"NARRATOR:JON sets the hand aflame, and it writhes. The WIGHT screeches helplessly. JON drops the arm."
30647,"JON: And we can destroy them with dragonglass. If we don't win this fight, then that is the fate of every person in the world."
30648,"NARRATOR:JON stabs the WIGHT in the heart with his dragonglass knife, and the WIGHT falls lifeless after a final screech. CERSEI stares in disbelief, and DAENERYS watches. JON approaches CERSEI."
30649,JON: There is only one war that matters the Great War. And it is here.
30650,NARRATOR:CERSEI looks to JAIME.
30651,DAENERYS: I didn't believe it until I saw them. I saw them all.
30652,JAIME: How many?
30653,"DAENERYS: A hundred thousand, at least."
30654,NARRATOR:EURON rises to investigate the lifeless WIGHT.
30655,EURON: Can they swim?
30656,JON: No.
30657,EURON: Good. I'm taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands.
30658,CERSEI: What are you talking about?
30659,"EURON: I've been around the world. I've seen everything, things you couldn't imagine, and this this is the only thing I've ever seen that terrifies me."
30660,NARRATOR:EURON walks over to DAENERYS.
30661,"EURON: I'm going back to my island. You should go back to yours. When winter's over, we'll be the only ones left alive."
30662,NARRATOR:EURON exits.
30663,"CERSEI: He's right to be afraid. And a coward to run. If those things come for us, there will be no kingdoms to rule. Everything we suffered will have been for nothing. Everything we lost will have been for nothing. The crown accepts your truce. Until the dead are defeated, they are the true enemy."
30664,JON: (SIGHS)
30665,"CERSEI: In return, the King"
30666,DAENERYS: Just the King
30667,"CERSEI: (CHUCKLES) I would never ask it of you. You would never agree to it. And if you did, I would trust you even less than I do now. I ask it only of Ned Stark's son. I know Ned Stark's son."
30668,NARRATOR:JON looks to DAVOS and DAENERYS.
30669,JON: I am true to my word. Or I try to be. That is why I cannot give you what you ask. I cannot serve two queens. And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen.
30670,CERSEI: Then there is nothing left to discuss. The dead will come north first. Enjoy dealing with them. We will deal with whatever is left of you.
30671,"NARRATOR:CERSEI, JAIME, QYBURN and the MOUNTAIN move to leave. BRIENNE follows."
30672,BRIENNE: Ser Jaime.
30673,JAIME: It's been good to see you. I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield.
30674,BRIENNE: We both saw what just happened. We both saw that thing.
30675,"JAIME: Yes, and I'm not looking forward to seeing more of them. But I'm loyal to the queen and you're loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother."
30676,NARRATOR:BRIENNE hits JAIME on the arm
30677,"BRIENNE: Oh, fuck loyalty!"
30678,JAIME: Fuck loyalty?
30679,BRIENNE: This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths. Talk to the queen.
30680,"NARRATOR:JAIME looks to CERSEI, who turns and walks away with QYBURN."
30681,JAIME: And tell her what?
30682,NARRATOR:JAIME exits.
30683,NARRATOR:Those that remain contemplate what has happened.
30684,DAVOS: I wish you hadn't done that.
30685,"DAENERYS: I'm grateful for your loyalty, but my dragon died so that we could be here. If it's all for nothing, then he died for nothing."
30686,JON: I know!
30687,TYRION: I'm pleased you bent the knee to our queen
30688,JON: I'm not going to swear an oath I can't uphold. Talk about my father.
30689,TYRION: That is indeed a problem. The more immediate problem is that we're fucked.
30690,DAVOS: Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs?
30691,"TYRION: Only one. Everyone stays here, and I go and talk to my sister."
30692,DAENERYS: I didn't come all this way to have my Hand
30693,TYRION: I don't want Cersei to murder me either. I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble.
30694,JON: I did this. I should go.
30695,TYRION:  She'll definitely murder you. I go see my sister.
30696,DAENERYS: (Nods)
30697,NARRATOR:Tyrion exits.
30698,CUT TO: King's Landing portico
30699,"NARRATOR:Tyrion walks the halls of the castle, followed by the MOUNTAIN. He meets with JAIME."
30700,TYRION: You spoke with her?
30701,"JAIME: At her until she kicked me out. She thinks I was an idiot to trust you. A lot of people seem to think that, actually."
30702,"TYRION: I'm about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world who's already tried to kill me twice, that I know of. Who's an idiot?"
30703,"JAIME: I suppose we should say goodbye, one idiot to another."
30704,"NARRATOR:TYRION advances, and the MOUNTAIN leads him inside"
30705,CUT TO: Council Chamber.
30706,NARRATOR:The MOUNTAIN accompanies TYRION into the chamber to meet CERSEI.
30707,"CERSEI: I shouldn't be surprised, I suppose. She's your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesn't know her place."
30708,"TYRION: A foreign whore you can't abduct, beat, or intimidate. That must be difficult for you."
30709,"CERSEI: So you bring her here with her pet Northerner,  whom you've convinced to bow down before her."
30710,TYRION:  I didn't know about that.
30711,"CERSEI: And now you've got them both working towards the same goal, the goal you've worked towards your entire life."
30712,"TYRION:  Cersei, I didn't know."
30713,CERSEI: the destruction of this family.
30714,TYRION: I am the one preventing that from happening. Daenerys didn't want to debate and negotiate. She didn't want to bring you words. She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise. I don't want to destroy our family. I never have.
30715,CERSEI: You killed our father
30716,"TYRION: After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didn't commit, yes, I killed him. Hate me for it if you want. I hate myself for it in spite of what he was, in spite of what he did to me."
30717,"CERSEI: Oh, poor little man. Your papa was mean to you. Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow? You left us open. You laid us bare for the vultures, and the vultures came and tore us apart. You may not have killed Joffrey, but you killed Myrcella, you killed Tommen. No one would've touched them if Father--"
30718,TYRION:  I have never been more sorry about anything.
30719,"CERSEI: I will not hear it, not from you."
30720,TYRION: (starts)
30721,CERSEI: I will not hear it!
30722,"TYRION: All right. You love your family, and I have destroyed it. I will always be a threat. So put an end to me."
30723,NARRATOR:CERSEI pauses.
30724,"TYRION: If it weren't for me, you'd have a motherIf it weren't for me, you'd have a father."
30725,"NARRATOR:The MOUNTAIN readies to draw his sword. CERSEI sighs and sits back, eyes closed. The MOUNTAIN stands back. TYRION pours himself some wine and drinks it down. He pours another glass, and walks back to CERSEI, placing his cup on her desk. He takes another glass.."
30726,TYRION: I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know.
30727,CERSEI: I will not
30728,TYRION:  I don't care. I loved them. You know I did. You know it in your heart if there's anything left of it.
30729,NARRATOR:TYRION pours himself wine and takes a drink.
30730,CERSEI: It doesn't matter. Your love doesn't matter. Your feelings don't matter. I don't care why you did what you did. I only care what it cost us. It cost us our future.
30731,"TYRION: If there's no future, then why are we here? Why did you allow me to come?"
30732,CERSEI: Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction.
30733,"TYRION: Yes, no, not what you hoped for, but you must have hoped for something."
30734,CERSEI: What did you hope for?  To make Jon Snow submit to your queen.
30735,"TYRION: Mm, not like this."
30736,"CERSEI: But eventually, you want everyone to bend the knee to her."
30737,TYRION: Yes.
30738,CERSEI: Why?
30739,TYRION: Because I think she will make the world a better place.
30740,CERSEI: You said she'd destroy King's Landing.
30741,TYRION: She knows herself. She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them.
30742,CERSEI: That's the difference between you. I don't care about checking my worst impulses. I don't care about making the world a better place. Hang the world.
30743,NARRATOR:CERSEI cradles her belly and TYRION notices. She takes a deep breath.
30744,"CERSEI: That thing you dragged here, I know what it is, I know what it means. And when it came at me, I didn't think about the world. Not at all. As soon as it opened its mouth, the world disappeared for me, right down its black throat. All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most, away from my family. Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea. Get on a boat, take those who matter."
30745,TYRION: You're pregnant.
30746,NARRATOR:CERSEI does not answer.
30747,CUT TO: Side Area of the Dragon Pit
30748,NARRATOR:JON picks up some bleached bones from the dirt floor. DAENERYS approaches him.
30749,JON: No one is less happy about this than I am.
30750,"DAENERYS: I know. I respect what you did. Wish you hadn't done it, but I respect it."
30751,NARRATOR:DAENERYS takes the bone from JON.
30752,"DAENERYS: This place was the beginning of the end for my family. (Speaks Valerian.) A dragon is not a slave. They were terrifying. Extraordinary. They filled people with wonder and awe, and we locked them in here. They wasted away. They grew small. And we grew small as well. We weren't extraordinary without them. We were just like everyone else."
30753,NARRATOR:She hands the bone back to JON.
30754,JON: You're not like everyone else. And your family hasn't seen its end. You're still here.
30755,DAENERYS: I can't have children.
30756,JON: Who told you that?
30757,DAENERYS: The witch who murdered my husband.
30758,JON: Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information?
30759,"DAENERYS: You were right from the beginning. If I had trusted you, everything would be different."
30760,"JON: So, what now?"
30761,DAENERYS: I can't forget what I saw north of the Wall. And I can't pretend that Cersei won't take back half the country the moment I march north.
30762,JON: It appears Tyrion's assessment was correct. We're fucked.
30763,DAENERYS: (Laughs)
30764,"NARRATOR:They hear footsteps, and they walk back to the others. The camera shifts to the main area of the Dragon Pit. TYRION walks in alone. He is followed by CERSEI, the MOUNTAIN, QYBURN, JAIME and the Lannister guards. The northern delegation watches as they approach the dais."
30765,"CERSEI: My armies will not stand down. I will not pull them back to the capital. I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War. The darkness is coming for us all. We'll face it together. And when the Great War is over, perhaps you'll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you. I expect not. Call our banners. All of them."
30766,CUT TO: The North
30767,NARRATOR:A raven flies in the wintery night towards Winterfell.
30768,CUT TO: Winterfell interior
30769,LITTLEFINGER: It's not easy for ravens to fly in these storms. Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier.
30770,"SANSA: No, this is the way he is, the way he's always been. He never asked for my opinion. Why would he start now?"
30771,LITTLEFINGER: I can't believe he'd surrender the Northern crown without consulting you.
30772,"SANSA: This is his writing, his signature. He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen. He's bent the knee."
30773,LITTLEFINGER: I've heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful.
30774,SANSA: What does that have to do with anything?
30775,LITTLEFINGER: Jon is young and unmarried. Daenerys is young and unmarried.
30776,SANSA: You think he wants to marry her?
30777,"LITTLEFINGER: An alliance makes sense. Together, they'd be difficult to defeat. He was named King."
30778,"SANSA: Even if I wanted to, Arya would never go along. She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me, and she'd kill anyone who betrayed her family."
30779,"LITTLEFINGER: You are family, too. Would Arya really murder her own sister?"
30780,SANSA: Do you know what she is now? Do you know what the Faceless Men are?
30781,"LITTLEFINGER: Only by reputation. They worship the God of Death, I believe. I never trust godly men."
30782,SANSA: They're killers. And Arya was one of them. What do you think she's after?
30783,LITTLEFINGER: She's your sister
30784,SANSA: She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family.
30785,LITTLEFINGER: Why did she come to Winterfell?
30786,SANSA: To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family.
30787,LITTLEFINGER: Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write?
30788,SANSA: To provide proof of my betrayals. To provide justification after she murders me.
30789,"LITTLEFINGER: And after she murders you, what does she become?"
30790,SANSA: Lady
30791,NARRATOR:SANSA contemplates.
30792,CUT TO: Dragonstone Map Room
30793,"NARRATOR:JON, DAENERYS, DAVOS, JORAH, THEON, VARYS, MISSANDEI, GREY WORM and TYRION strategize."
30794,"JON: If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad, they'll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight."
30795,"DAENERYS: And the Unsullied? We can sail with them to White Harbor, meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad, then ride together to Winterfell."
30796,"JORAH: Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell, Your Grace. You have many enemies in the North. Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow. He'll see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one well-placed bolt will make him a hero. The man who killed the conqueror."
30797,"JON: It's your decision, Your Grace. But if we're going to be allies in this war, it's important for the Northerners to see us as allies. If we sail to White Harbor together, I think it sends a better message."
30798,DAENERYS: I've not come to conquer the North. I'm coming to save the North. We sail together.
30799,CUT TO: Dragonstone Throne Room
30800,"NARRATOR:JON and DAVOS walk through the room, away from the meeting. THEON trails behind."
30801,THEON: Jon.
30802,NARRATOR:JON and DAVOS stop and turn.
30803,THEON: Can I speak with you?
30804,JON: All right.
30805,NARRATOR:DAVOS exits.
30806,"THEON: What you did in King's Landing, what you said... You could've lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys. You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth."
30807,JON: We went down there to make peace. And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if we're going to fight together.
30808,"THEON: You've always known what was right. Even when we were all young and stupid, you always knew. Every step you take it's always the right step."
30809,"JON: It's not. It may seem that way from the outside, but I promise you, it's not true. I've done plenty of things that I regret."
30810,"THEON: Not compared to me, you haven't."
30811,JON: No. Not compared to you.
30812,THEON: I always wanted to do the right thing. Be the right kind of person. But I never knew what that meant. It always seemed like there's like there was an impossible choice I had to make. Stark or Greyjoy.
30813,JON: Our father was more of a father.
30814,THEON: He was.
30815,JON: And you betrayed him. Betrayed his memory.
30816,THEON: I did.
30817,JON: (SIGHS) But you never lost him. He's a part of you. Just like he's a part of me.
30818,THEON: But the things I've done.
30819,"JON: It's not my place to forgive you for all of it. But what I can forgive, I do. You don't need to choose. You're a Greyjoy and you're a Stark."
30820,"THEON: When I was Ramsay's prisoner, Yara tried to save me. She's the only one who tried to save me. (SNIFFLES) She needs me now."
30821,"JON: So, why are you still talking to me?"
30822,NARRATOR:JON exits.
30823,CUT TO: The shores of King's Landing
30824,"NARRATOR:HARRAG and the ironborn load their skiffs, preparing to depart."
30825,"HARRAG: Load up. Load up, lads. Go on. Tide's coming in."
30826,NARRATOR:THEON approaches
30827,THEON: All of us chose to follow Yara. We left the Iron Islands for Yara. She would never leave one of us behind. We're not leaving her behind.
30828,HARRAG: Your sister--
30829,THEON:  She's not dead.
30830,"HARRAG:  She's dead. Even if Euron hasn't cut her throat yet, she's dead."
30831,THEON: She's our queen
30832,HARRAG: She's your sister
30833,THEON: I did. I ran from my uncle.
30834,"HARRAG: So, why in fuck's name should we listen to you? They say the dead can't swim. We're going to sail east, find a nice, quiet island, kill all the men, and take their wives for ourselves."
30835,THEON:  We're done with all that.
30836,HARRAG: Who says we are?
30837,"THEON: Yara did. She made a pledge. We're going to find her, and we're going to set her free."
30838,NARRATOR:HARRAG spits in THEON's face. The men laugh.
30839,"HARRAG: Run away, little Theon. It's what you do best."
30840,MAN: He needs to shut his mouth.
30841,"NARRATOR:HARRAG swings a strong blow to THEON's chin. THEON reels, but recovers to throw a counter-punch. HARRAG evades the blow, they grapple and THEON is thrown to the ground."
30842,MAN: Hey!
30843,"NARRATOR:The ironborn are enjoying the fight. THEON gets up and the grapple, before HARRAG lands a head butt. Followed by a leveling punch to the face."
30844,"MAN #2: Oh, yes!"
30845,MAN #3: That's more like it.
30846,"NARRATOR:THEON charges, grabbing HARRAG around the waist. But HARRAG gets the better of him, and THEON ends up back on the sand, bloodied."
30847,HARRAG: Stay down or I'll kill you!
30848,"NARRATOR:THEON gets up, woozy. HARRAG punches him again, and he crumbles to the sand, groaning."
30849,HARRAG: (panting) I said stay down or I'll kill you!
30850,"NARRATOR:THEON gets up again, and they set on one another. HARRAG knees THEON in the groin, but there is no reaction. He does it again. THEON is emboldened. He head butts HARRAG, then tackles him. He sits astride HARRAG and delivers repeated, punishing blows to his bloodied face. HARRAG is defeated."
30851,THEON: Not for me. For Yara!
30852,MEN: Yara!
30853,"NARRATOR:THEON staggers to the water, and he cleanses his face."
30854,CUT TO: King's Landing Exterior
30855,"NARRATOR:Sansa contemplates the landscape on a grey, snowy day from the ramparts of Winterfell. She makes up her mind and walks towards a guard."
30856,SANSA: Have my sister
30857,CUT TO: The Great Hall of Winterfell
30858,"NARRATOR:SANSA and BRAN sit at the great table, with WOLKAN standing to the side. The room is filled with northmen. The guards escort ARYA into the hall, and leave her standing alone in front of the table. ARYA looks around and spies YOHN ROYCE, then LITTLEFINGER."
30859,ARYA: Are you sure you want to do this?
30860,SANSA: It's not what I want. It's what honor demands.
30861,ARYA: And what does honor demand?
30862,SANSA: That I defend my family from those who would harm us. That I defend the North from those who would betray us.
30863,"ARYA: All right, then. Get on with it."
30864,SANSA: You stand accused of murder. You stand accused of treason. How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish?
30865,"NARRATOR:SANSA and ARYA turn their heads towards LITTLEFINGER, as do the others in the room. LITTLEFINGER is dumbfounded."
30866,ARYA: My sister asked you a question.
30867,"LITTLEFINGER: Lady Sansa, forgive me I'm a bit confused."
30868,"SANSA: Which charges confuse you? Let's start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt, Lysa Arryn. You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall. Do you deny it?"
30869,LITTLEFINGER: I did it to protect you.
30870,"SANSA: You did it to take power in the Vale. Earlier, you conspired to murder Jon."
30871,LITTLEFINGER: Whatever your aunt
30872,SANSA: You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon.
30873,LITTLEFINGER: I know of no such letter.
30874,SANSA: You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father.
30875,LITTLEFINGER: I deny it! None of you were there to see what happened. None of you knows the truth.
30876,BRAN: You held a knife to his throat.
30877,"NARRATOR:LITTLEFINGER turns to face BRAN, surprised at this knowledge he has."
30878,"BRAN: You said, ""I did warn you not the trust me."""
30879,ARYA: You told our mother
30880,NARRATOR:ARYA draws the knife.
30881,"LITTLEFINGER: Lady Sansa, I have known you since you were a girl. I've protected you."
30882,SANSA: Protected me? By selling me to the Boltons?
30883,"LITTLEFINGER: If we could speak alone, I can explain everything."
30884,"SANSA: Sometimes when I'm trying to understand a person's motives, I play a little game. I assume the worst. What's the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThat's what you do, isn't it? That's what you've always done turn family against family, turn sister against sister. That's what you did to our mother."
30885,"LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, please."
30886,"SANSA: I'm a slow learner, it's true. But I learn."
30887,LITTLEFINGER: Give me a chance to defend myself. I deserve that.
30888,SANSA: (Nods.)
30889,LITTLEFINGER: I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie.
30890,JOHN ROYCE: I think not.
30891,NARRATOR:LITTLEFINGER kneels before SANSA.
30892,"LITTLEFINGER: Sansa, I beg you! I loved your mother since the time I was a boy."
30893,"SANSA: And yet, you betrayed her."
30894,LITTLEFINGER: I loved you. More than anyone.
30895,"SANSA: And yet, you betrayed me."
30896,NARRATOR:SANSA rises.
30897,"SANSA: When you brought me back to Winterfell, you told me there's no justice in the world, not unless we make it. Thank you for all your many lessons, Lord Baelish. I will never forget them."
30898,"NARRATOR:ARYA steps briskly towards LITTLEFINGER, and slashes his throat with his own knife, swiftly."
30899,LITTLEFINGER: Sansa! (GASPS) I--
30900,"NARRATOR:ARYA returns tableside, and everyone watches as LITTLEFINGER dies."
30901,CUT TO: An Interior Courtyard in King's Landing.
30902,NARRATOR:Jaime paces into the yard. CERSEI watches from the upper level.
30903,JAIME: Our men in King's Landing will march north in three days' time.
30904,MAN: It'll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train.
30905,"JAIME: We don't have a fortnight. If the North falls, we fall. Three days. The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east. We'll meet at Lord Harroway's Town and march together to Winterfell."
30906,CERSEI: Ser Jaime.
30907,JAIME: Your Grace.
30908,NARRATOR:The lords bow in union to CERSEI
30909,"CERSEI: My lords, I need a moment with my brother."
30910,MEN: Your Grace.
30911,NARRATOR:JAIME dismisses them and the lords exit. CERSEI walks down to ground level to join him.
30912,CERSEI: What are you doing?
30913,JAIME: Preparing the expedition north.
30914,"CERSEI: Expedition north? I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister. The Starks and Targaryens have united against us, and you want to fight alongside them? Are you a traitor or an idiot?"
30915,JAIME: You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy.
30916,CERSEI: I'll say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house. You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father.
30917,JAIME: You saw it with your own eyes. You saw a dead man trying to kill us.
30918,"CERSEI: I saw it burn. If dragons can't stop them, if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen can't stop them, how will our armies make a difference?"
30919,"JAIME: This isn't about noble houses, this is about the living and the dead!"
30920,CERSEI: And I intend to stay amongst the living. Let the Stark boy and his new queen--
30921,JAIME: I made a promise.
30922,CERSEI: Our child will rule Westeros.
30923,JAIME: Our child will never be born if the dead come south.
30924,"CERSEI: The monsters are real. The white walkers, the dragons, the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young, they're all real. So be it. Let the monsters kill each other. And while they battle in the North, we take back the lands that belong to us."
30925,JAIME: And then what?
30926,CERSEI: And then we rule.
30927,"JAIME: When the fighting in the North is over, someone wins. You understand that, don't you? If the dead win, they march south and kill us all. If the living win, and we've betrayed them, they march south and kill us all!"
30928,CERSEI: The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all. Most of them will die in the North.
30929,JAIME: I faced them in the field. We can't beat them. We can't beat their dragons.
30930,CERSEI: How many dragons did you see at the pit?
30931,JAIME: Two.
30932,CERSEI: What happened to the third?
30933,"JAIME: For all we know, it's guarding her fleet!"
30934,"CERSEI: She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied. She came here to show us all her power. No, something happened.The dragons are vulnerable."
30935,JAIME: We can't beat the Dothraki. We don't have the numbers. We don't have the support of the other houses!
30936,"CERSEI: No, we have something better. We have the Iron Bank. You should've listened more when Father--"
30937,JAIME: The Golden Company is not here. They're in Essos. How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us?
30938,CERSEI: Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands? Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen?
30939,"JAIME: You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me, the commander."
30940,"CERSEI: And you conspired with Tyrion, the man who murdered our father without telling me, your queen."
30941,JAIME: I didn't conspire with him.
30942,CERSEI: You met with him in secret without my consent. You planned to promote my enemies' interests. That is the definition of conspiracy.
30943,JAIME: I pledged to ride north. I intend to honor that pledge.
30944,CERSEI: And that will be treason.
30945,JAIME: Treason?
30946,CERSEI: Disobeying your queen
30947,JAIME: Doesn't matter what I'd call it.
30948,"NARRATOR:JAIME starts to exit, but he is blocked by the MOUNTAIN."
30949,CERSEI: I told you no one walks away from me.
30950,"JAIME: Are you going to order him to kill me? I'm the only one you have left. Our children are gone, our father"
30951,CERSEI:  There's one more yet to come.
30952,"JAIME: Give the order, then."
30953,"NARRATOR:CERSEI hesitates, and JAIME thinks that he has called her bluff. Then CERSEI nods to the MOUNTAIN, who unsheathes his sword. JAIME looks nervous, then makes up his mind."
30954,JAIME: I  don't believe you.
30955,"NARRATOR:JAIME moves past the MOUNTAIN, who lets him go. CERSEI starts after him, but lets him go."
30956,CUT TO: Outside King's Landing.
30957,"NARRATOR:JAIME rides his horse away from KIng's Landing. He inspects his golden hand, then fits his glove over it. He looks up into the grey day, as snow flurries come down. He rides off."

30962,NARRATOR:SAM enters.
30963,BRAN: Samwell Tarly.
30964,SAM: I wasn't sure if you'd remember me.
30965,BRAN: I remember everything.

30967,BRAN: You helped us get beyond the Wall. You're a good man.
30968,"SAM: Oh, well, thank you, but, um, I'm not sure that I am. What happened to you beyond the Wall?"
30969,BRAN: I became the Three-Eyed Raven.
30970,SAM: Oh! I don't know what that means.
30971,BRAN: I can see things that happened in the past. I can see things happening now all over the world. Why did you come to Winterfell?
30972,"SAM: Um, Jon's the one to lead the fight against the dead. I know he is. But he can't do it alone, so I've come here to help him."
30973,BRAN: He's on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen. You you saw this  in a vision?
30974,NARRATOR:BRAN holds up a scroll delivered by a raven.
30975,SAM: Oh.
30976,BRAN: He needs to know the truth.
30977,SAM: The truth about what?
30978,BRAN: About himself. No one knows. No one but me. Jon isn't really my father's son He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt.
30979,SAM: It's not.
30980,BRAN: Dornish bastards are named Sand.
30981,"SAM: At the Citadel, I transcribed a High Septon's diary. He annulled Rhaegar's marriage to Elia. He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony."
30982,BRAN: Are you certain?
30983,SAM:  It's what the High Septon wrote in his private diary. I don't know why he'd lie. Is this something you can see?

30987,"LYANNA: Father, Smith, Warrior, Mother, Maiden, Crone, Stranger. I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days."

31007,SANSA: You did it.
31008,ARYA: I'm just the executioner. You passed the sentence. You're the Lady.
31009,SANSA: Does that bother you?
31010,ARYA: I was never going to be as good a lady as you. So I had to be something else. I never could have survived what you survived.

31023,TORMUND: Yeah. The crows keep telling me I'll get used to it.
31024,NARRATOR:Figures start to emerge from the forrest.
31025,"MAN: I can see movement. Watch, on the tree line!"
31026,MAN #2: What is it?
31027,"NARRATOR:A huge undead army emerges from the trees. The white walkers are mounted, holding a spear. Dark clouds swirl. A horn blares as the undead army gets closer to the wall. The undead army stops, and all is still."
31028,"NARRATOR:Atop the wall, TORMUND and BERIC look out nervously. A dragon's screech comes from the darkness. The undead Viserion flies in, and spits out blue flame at the wall as he passes. TORMUND and BERIC stare in disbelief. The Night King rides astride the undead dragon. TORMUND and BERIC hurry down from the watchtower."
31029,TORMUND: Come on!  Run! Run!
31030,"NARRATOR:The Night's Watchmen flee as the undead dragon attacks the wall will blue flame. The wall begins to buckle and fall. The stairways shake and destruct. Many fall to their deaths. The undead army watches, motionless. TORMUND and BERIC barely escape from the collapsing section of the wall. Once it has come to the ground, the undead army starts to advance. The army seems endless, and includes undead giants. The Night King leads from above, riding Viserion. The undead march south of the wall."
31031,CUT TO: HORSE-DRAWN CARRIAGE
31032,NARRATOR:A carriage is among the army and it carries within it TYRION LANNISTER who sits opposite LORD VARYS.
31033,TYRION: You should consider yourself lucky. At least your balls won’t freeze off.
31034,"VARYS: You take great offense at dwarf jokes, but love telling eunuch jokes. Why is that?"
31035,"TYRION: Because I have balls, and you don't."
31036,NARRATOR:The army continues to march and MISSANDEI and GREY WORM ride alongside each other. The villagers stare at them disapprovingly. People also stare at JON and DAENERYS as they ride past.
31037,JON: I warned you. Northerners don't much trust outsiders.
31038,"NARRATOR:A dragon roars and the villagers look up at the sky in fear. People start clamouring as DAENERYS’ dragons, DROGON and RHAEGAL, fly overhead. ARYA emerges from the crowd smiling. The dragons swoop over Winterfell and SANSA STARK watches them fly overhead from the walls of Winterfell."
31039,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE
31040,NARRATOR:DAENERYS and JON ride into Winterfell towards a crowd of people standing within. BRAN STARK is sitting at the front of the crowd. JON rides up to him and dismounts his horse. He walks up to BRAN and kisses him on the forehead.
31041,JON: Look at you.
31042,NARRATOR:JON sniffles
31043,JON: You're a man.
31044,BRAN: Almost.
31045,NARRATOR:JON looks at him quizzically and then up to SANSA who is standing next to him. He walks up to her and gives her a hug. JORAH MORMONT and DAENERYS watch from behind.
31046,JON: Where's Arya?
31047,SANSA: Lurking somewhere.
31048,NARRATOR:JON turns around to DAENERYS and she walks over to him.
31049,"JON: Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen. My sister, Sansa Stark, the Lady of Winterfell."
31050,"DAENERYS: Thank you for inviting us into your home, Lady Stark. The North is as beautiful as your brother claimed, as are you."
31051,NARRATOR:SANSA looks at DAENERYS hesitantly.
31052,"SANSA: Winterfell is yours, Your Grace."
31053,BRAN: We don't have time for all this. The Night King has your dragon.
31054,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns to look at BRAN.
31055,"BRAN: He's one of them now. The Wall has fallen, the dead march south."
31056,"NARRATOR:SANSA, DAENERYS and JON all look at each other concerned."
31057,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – LARGE HALL
31058,"SANSA: As soon as we heard about the Wall, I called all our banners to retreat to Winterfell. Lord Umber when can we expect your people to arrive?"
31059,NARRATOR:A young boy stands up from the side of the room and walks forwards.
31060,"UMBER: We need more horses and wagons, if it please my lady."
31061,NARRATOR:He stops and then turns to look at JON.
31062,UMBER: And my lord.
31063,NARRATOR:He stops again and then turns to look at DAENERYS.
31064,UMBER: And my queen. Sorry.
31065,SANSA: You'll have as many as we can spare. Hurry back to Last Hearth and bring your people here.
31066,NARRATOR:UMBER bows and walks out the hall as people chatter.
31067,JON: We need to send ravens to the Night's Watch as well. There's no sense in manning the castles anymore. We make our stand here.
31068,"MAESTER WOLKAN: At once, Your Grace."
31069,NARRATOR:WOLKAN exits.
31070,"LYANNA MORMONT: ""Your Grace."""
31071,NARRATOR:LYANNA stands up and walks forwards
31072,NARRATOR:People start murmuring.
31073,LYANNA: A lord? Nothing at all?
31074,JON: It's not important.
31075,LYANNA: Not important? We named you King in the North.
31076,NARRATOR:People start cheering.
31077,MAN: King of the North!
31078,"JON: You did, my lady. It was the honor of my life. I’ll always be grateful for your faith. But when I left Winterfell, I told you we need allies or we will die. I have brought those allies home to fight alongside us. I had a choice, keep my crown or protect the North. I chose the North."
31079,NARRATOR:People murmur. TYRION stands up and walks to the centre of the room.
31080,"TYRION: If anyone survives the war to come, we'll have Jon Snow to thank. He risked his life to show us the threat is real. Thanks to his courage, we have brought with us the greatest army the world has ever seen. We have brought two full-grown dragons. And soon, the Lannister army will ride north to join our cause."
31081,NARRATOR:People grumble and yell out indistinctly.
31082,"TYRION: I know, I know, our people haven't been friends in the past. But we must fight together now or die."
31083,"SANSA: May I ask, how are we meant to feed the greatest army the world has ever seen? While I ensured our stores would last through winter, I didn't account for Dothraki, Unsullied and two full-grown dragons. What do dragons eat, anyway?"
31084,DAENERYS: Whatever they want.
31085,NARRATOR:Many men move around wagons full of dragonglass. One man knocks a bit out of a wagon and GENDRY catches it before it hits the ground.
31086,"GENDRY: Hey, careful, lads. We need every last bit of it."
31087,MAN 1: Sorry ’bout that.
31088,NARRATOR:GENDRY climbs into the back of one of the wagons.
31089,GENDRY: Are these the last of the wagons?
31090,NARRATOR:The camera cuts to TYRION who is watching over the courtyard.
31091,MAN 2 (O.S.): Aye.
31092,"GENDRY (O.S.): All right, let's get it all to the forges."
31093,NARRATOR:TYRION walks up to SANSA and YOHN ROYCE.
31094,TYRION: My lord. My lady.
31095,"NARRATOR:ROYCE turns to look at SANSA, who nods back."
31096,ROYCE: My lady.
31097,NARRATOR:ROYCE exits.
31098,TYRION: The Lady of Winterfell. Has a nice ring to it.
31099,"SANSA: So does Hand of the Queen. Depending on the queen, I suppose."
31100,TYRION: Last time we spoke was at Joffrey's wedding. Miserable affair.
31101,SANSA: It had its moments.
31102,"NARRATOR:They both glance at each other, remembering the murder of JOFFREY BARATHEON."
31103,SANSA: Apologies for leaving like that.
31104,"TYRION: Yes, it was a bit hard to explain why my wife fled moments after the king's murder."
31105,SANSA: We both survived.
31106,TYRION: Many underestimated you. Most of them are dead now.
31107,NARRATOR:There is a short silence.
31108,"TYRION: I'm sure you weren't thrilled to hear the Lannister army's marching north. You have every right to be fearful of my sister. No one fears her more than I do. But I promise, you'll be safe-"
31109,SANSA: Cersei told you her army was coming north to fight for you?
31110,TYRION: She did.
31111,SANSA: And you believed her?
31112,TYRION: She has something to live for now. I believe she wants to survive.
31113,SANSA: I used to think you were the cleverest man alive.
31114,NARRATOR:SANSA exits and TYRION turns to see BRAN staring at him from the courtyard.
31115,NARRATOR:JON stands next to the weirwood tree and looks at the face carved into the trunk
31116,ARYA (O.S.): You used to be taller.
31117,NARRATOR:JON turns around to see ARYA standing near him.
31118,JON: How did you sneak up on me?
31119,ARYA: How did you survive a knife through the heart?
31120,JON: I didn't.
31121,"NARRATOR:ARYA laughs, they both run towards each other and embrace. Once they break from their hug, JON looks down to see ARYA's sword and scoffs in disbelief."
31122,JON: You still have it.
31123,NARRATOR:ARYA unsheathes her sword.
31124,ARYA: Needle.
31125,JON: Have you ever used it?
31126,ARYA: Once or twice.
31127,"NARRATOR:ARYA puts Needle away. JON pulls out his sword, Longclaw, and hands it to ARYA."
31128,ARYA: Valyrian steel.
31129,JON: Jealous?
31130,NARRATOR:ARYA scoffs.
31131,ARYA: Too heavy for me.
31132,NARRATOR:JON sheaths his sword and puts his hand on ARYA's shoulder.
31133,JON: Where were you before? I could've used your help with Sansa.
31134,"ARYA: She doesn't like your queen, does she?"
31135,JON: Sansa thinks she's smarter than everyone.
31136,ARYA: She's the smartest person I've ever met.
31137,JON: Now you're defending her?
31138,NARRATOR:JON chuckles.
31139,JON: You?
31140,ARYA: I'm defending our family. So is she.
31141,JON: Yeah. I'm her family too.
31142,NARRATOR:ARYA hugs JON.
31143,ARYA: Don't forget that.
31144,"QYBURN: Your Grace, I'm afraid I bring terrible news. The dead have broken through the Wall."
31145,NARRATOR:CERSEI's lips curl.
31146,CERSEI: Good.
31147,NARRATOR:She exits as the camera pans around. EURON GREYJOY's Iron Fleet is out at sea and QYBURN turns to look out at them.
31148,CUT TO: EURON'S SHIP
31149,NARRATOR:EURON smiles and stares out at King's Landing from his ship. He walks in the cabin
31150,NARRATOR:EURON walks inside and past YARA GREYJOY who is tied to a post in the cabin.
31151,YARA: Why don't you just get it over with and kill me?
31152,NARRATOR:EURON walks up to her and crouches down.
31153,EURON: But we're family. The last Greyjoys left in the world. The last ones with balls anyway.
31154,NARRATOR:EURON chuckles and pops the lid off his drink.
31155,EURON: If I kill you who can I talk to? Hmm?
31156,NARRATOR:He sighs.
31157,EURON: I've got a crew full of mutes. It gets lonely at sea.
31158,YARA: Are we in King's Landing?
31159,EURON: Mm.
31160,NARRATOR:He turns and offers his drink.
31161,YARA: You picked the losing side.
31162,EURON: Then I'll sail the Iron Fleet somewhere else.
31163,NARRATOR:He stands up and turns to look her in the eyes.
31164,EURON: But first I'm gonna fuck the queen.
31165,NARRATOR:EURON exits.
31166,CUT TO: RED KEEP – GREAT HALL
31167,"NARRATOR:CERSEI sits on the Iron Throne, EURON and HARRY STRICKLAND stand opposite her."
31168,"CERSEI: Twenty-thousand men, is it?"
31169,"HARRY: Yes, Your Grace. A few died in transit."
31170,EURON: They cheated at dice. Or maybe I cheated. Someone cheated. They weren't good fighters. You won't miss them.
31171,CERSEI: Horses?
31172,HARRY: Two thousand.
31173,CERSEI: And elephants?
31174,"HARRY: Uh, no elephants, Your Grace."
31175,CERSEI: That's disappointing. I was told the Golden Company had elephants.
31176,"HARRY: They are excellent beasts, Your Grace, but not well-suited to long sea voyages."
31177,"CERSEI: In any event, you are most welcome here in King's Landing, Captain Strickland."
31178,"HARRY: We look forward to fighting on your behalf, Your Grace."
31179,NARRATOR:HARRY bows and exits.
31180,EURON: Am I most welcome here?
31181,CERSEI: You are a true friend of the crown and an honored guest.
31182,EURON: Good. As a true friend and an honored guest
31183,"NARRATOR:EURON starts to walk forward but GREGOR ""THE MOUNTAIN"" CLEGANE steps in the way. EURON stops but leans towards CERSEI."
31184,EURON: I was hoping we could talk in private.
31185,CERSEI: After the war. That was our agreement.
31186,EURON: Wars sometimes last years.
31187,"CERSEI: You want a whore, buy one. You want a queen, earn her."
31188,NARRATOR:CERSEI stands and starts to walk out.
31189,EURON: How?
31190,NARRATOR:CERSEI stops.
31191,"EURON: I've given her justice, an army and the Iron Fleet, yet she gives me no sign of affection. My heart is nearly broken."
31192,NARRATOR:CERSEI turns around to face EURON.
31193,CERSEI: You're insolent. I've executed men for less.
31194,EURON: They were lesser men.
31195,"NARRATOR:CERSEI walks towards the door but halts. She turns around and looks at EURON. EURON chuckles and follows CERSEI, staring at THE MOUNTAIN as he walks past."
31196,"NARRATOR:BRONN is on a bed in brothel with 3 women around him, DIRAH, CRAYAH and MAREI."
31197,DIRAH: I hear the dragon burnt up a thousand Lannister men.
31198,CRAYAH: Burnt up some of my favorite boys.
31199,"DIRAH: Archie, was it?"
31200,CRAYAH: And William.
31201,DIRAH: Tall handsome William?
31202,"CRAYAH: Yeah, tall handsome William."
31203,DIRAH: They said what's left of him could fit in a wine glass.
31204,BRONN: I am the only man you ever met who shot a dragon.
31205,CRAYAH: Did you?
31206,BRONN: Nearly killed it.
31207,MAREI: That's brave.
31208,"NARRATOR:MAREI pushes BRONN back and climbs on top of him, CRAYAH and DIRAH climb on the bed either side."
31209,CRAYAH: That boy Eddie.
31210,DIRAH: The ginger?
31211,CRAYAH: That's him. Came back with his face burnt right off. He's got no eyelids now.
31212,DIRAH: How does he sleep with no eyelids?
31213,"BRONN: All right, can we stop talking about the fucking dragons now?"
31214,QYBURN (O.S.): Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.
31215,NARRATOR:BRONN sits up and all four of them look at QYBURN who is standing in the doorway.
31216,BRONN: You're kidding me.
31217,"QYBURN: Apologies for the interruption, but the queen did urge me to hurry."
31218,NARRATOR:BRONN sighs and removes MAREI from his lap.
31219,"BRONN: Sorry, ladies. Another time perhaps."
31220,NARRATOR:BRONN stands up and starts dressing himself. CRAYAH walks up to QYBURN.
31221,CRAYAH: You ever get lonely; I am partial to older gentlemen.
31222,NARRATOR:The three women leave.
31223,QYBURN: Poor girl. The pox will take her within the year.
31224,NARRATOR:BRONN chokes on his drink and coughs.
31225,BRONN: Which girl?
31226,QYBURN: The queen's brothers made promises to you and broke them. Her Grace wants to rectify their mistake.
31227,"BRONN: She once gave me a castle and a wife, then rectified me right out of them."
31228,"QYBURN: That was Ser Jaime's doing, not hers. When Queen Cersei wants something, she pays in advance and in gold. Several chests of it, in fact. Waiting for you in a wagon just outside."
31229,"BRONN: So, she wants to murder someone, but she can't send her soldiers. If it's the Dragon Queen she's after-"
31230,QYBURN: She has other plans for the Targaryen girl.
31231,"BRONN: Yeah, well, good luck with that."
31232,QYBURN: Our queen's brothers are unlikely to survive their Northern adventures. But in the event that they do-
31233,"NARRATOR:A guard brings in a large crossbow, one that TYRION had previously used to murder his, JAIME's and CERSEI's father, TYWIN LANNISTER."
31234,QYBURN: She has a keen sense of poetic justice.
31235,BRONN: That fucking family.
31236,"QYBURN: When the Citadel expelled me, I thought I would die poor and alone, but in exchange for my service, Queen Cersei made me her Hand. What would she do for the man who rids her of her treasonous brothers?"
31237,"NARRATOR:QYBURN walks up to BRONN and holds out the crossbow. After a short silence, BRONN takes it. QYBURN exits whilst BRONN looks at the crossbow in his hands."
31238,NARRATOR:CERSEI is standing behind a chair and sighs.
31239,CERSEI: I wanted those elephants.
31240,NARRATOR:The camera pans to reveal EURON getting dressed. He sighs and CERSEI walks around the chair and sits down.
31241,"EURON: So, how do I compare to the fat king?"
31242,CERSEI: You're insulting my late husband?
31243,NARRATOR:EURON walks up to her and whispers in her ear.
31244,EURON: Are you offended?
31245,"CERSEI: Robert had a different whore every night, but he still didn't know his way around a woman's body."
31246,EURON: And the Kingslayer?
31247,NARRATOR:CERSEI glares at EURON.
31248,"CERSEI: You enjoy risking your neck, don't you?"
31249,NARRATOR:EURON chuckles.
31250,EURON: Life is boring.
31251,"CERSEI: You're not boring, I'll give you that."
31252,"NARRATOR:EURON smiles and walks up to CERSEI, standing over her."
31253,EURON: Do I please the queen?
31254,CERSEI: You might be the most arrogant man I've ever met. I like that.
31255,NARRATOR:EURON chuckles.
31256,CERSEI: But now I want to be alone.
31257,NARRATOR:EURON leans down and speaks softly to CERSEI.
31258,EURON: I'm going to put a prince in your belly.
31259,NARRATOR:EURON exits and tears start to form in CERSEI's eyes.
31260,CUT TO: IRON FLEET
31261,"NARRATOR:A door can be heard open and then close, a bow string creaks and then an arrow pierces a man's head. More and more of EURON's men drop dead and a group of men walk over their bodies. YARA is still tied to the post in the cabin and looks up when she hears a bang. Suddenly, a body falls through the door with an axe in his face. THEON GREYJOY walks in after it, retrieves the axe and unties YARA. THEON helps YARA to her feet before she turns to him and headbutts him. THEON falls to the floor, stunned, and YARA extends a hand. THEON grabs her hand and they both exit the cabin."
31262,CUT TO: THEON'S SHIPS
31263,NARRATOR:Three ships from the Iron Fleet sail together.
31264,"YARA (O.S.): Euron can't defend the Iron Islands, not if he's in King's Landing with all his men and his ships."
31265,NARRATOR:YARA and THEON stand on deck next to one another.
31266,YARA: We can take our home back.
31267,THEON: Daenerys went north.
31268,YARA: Daenerys will need somewhere to retreat if they can't hold the North. Somewhere the dead can't go.
31269,NARRATOR:THEON pauses and sighs.
31270,THEON: You're my queen. I go where you command.
31271,NARRATOR:YARA turns to him.
31272,YARA: You want to go to Winterfell. To fight for the Starks. Go. What is dead may never die.
31273,NARRATOR:THEON turns to YARA.
31274,THEON: What is dead may never die.
31275,NARRATOR:They embrace and YARA leans to his ear.
31276,YARA: But kill the bastards anyway.
31277,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE
31278,"NARRATOR:Inside the gate, WOLKAN is greeting ALYS KARSTARK as the KARSTARKS arrive."
31279,"WOLKAN: Welcome back, my lady. If you'd follow me"
31280,"NARRATOR:WOLKAN and ALYS exit, VARYS, DAVOS SEAWORTH and TYRION are watching on."
31281,VARYS: The Karstarks.
31282,"TYRION: One of the better sigils. Beats an onion, anyway."
31283,DAVOS: Can't argue with that.
31284,NARRATOR:The three men start walking with each other.
31285,"DAVOS: Not so long ago, the Starks and the Karstarks were slaughtering each other on the battlefield. Jon Snow brought peace to the houses."
31286,TYRION: And our queen is grateful.
31287,"DAVOS: Her gratitude is lovely, but that's not my point. The Northmen are loyal to Jon Snow, not to her. They don't know her. The Free Folk don't know her. I've been up here a while, and I'm telling you, they're stubborn as goats. You want their loyalty, you have to earn it."
31288,NARRATOR:TYRION stops and thinks. He then catches up with DAVOS and VARYS who continued to walk.
31289,TYRION: I sense that you're leading to a proposal.
31290,NARRATOR:DAVOS looks out over the castle wall.
31291,"DAVOS: A proposal is what I'm proposing. On the off chance that we survive the Night King, what if the Seven Kingdoms, for once in their whole shit history, were ruled by a just woman and an honorable man?"
31292,"NARRATOR:VARYS and TYRION walk forward to look over the wall with DAVOS, they see JON and DAENERYS standing and talking with each other."
31293,TYRION: They do make a handsome couple.
31294,VARYS: You overestimate our influence. Jon and Daenerys don't want to listen to lonely old men.
31295,TYRION: I'm not that old.
31296,NARRATOR:TYRION looks up at VARYS and then at DAVOS.
31297,TYRION: Not as old as him.
31298,NARRATOR:DAVOS chuckles.
31299,TYRION: Our queen respects the wisdom of age.
31300,"VARYS: Of course she does. Respect is how the young keep us at a distance, so we don't remind them of an unpleasant truth."
31301,TYRION: What is that?
31302,VARYS: Nothing lasts.
31303,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE THE WALL
31304,NARRATOR:JON and DAENERYS walk together as men shout indistinctly in the background.
31305,DAENERYS: Your sister doesn't like me.
31306,NARRATOR:They both stop and turn to one another.
31307,"JON: She doesn't know you. If it makes you feel any better, she didn't like me either when we were growing up."
31308,DAENERYS: She doesn't need to be my friend but I am her queen. If she can't respect me-
31309,NARRATOR:Three Dothraki men ride up to DAENERYS.
31310,DAENERYS (speaking Dothraki): How many today?
31311,DOTHRAKI MAN #1: Only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
31312,NARRATOR:The Dothraki men ride away.
31313,JON (speaking the Common Tongue): What's the matter?
31314,DAENERYS: The dragons are barely eating.
31315,NARRATOR:DAENERYS walks off and JON follows.
31316,NARRATOR:EXT. FLAT CLEARINGJON and DAENERYS walk up to DROGON and RHAEGAL who are standing either side of a pile of bones. The dragons growl softly as they approach.
31317,JON: What's wrong with them?
31318,DAENERYS: They don't like the North.
31319,"NARRATOR:She touches DROGON's nose and RHAEGAL looks at JON and gets close. DAENERYS climbs on DROGON's back and, smiling, nods towards RHAEGAL."
31320,DAENERYS: Go on.
31321,"NARRATOR:JON looks at the dragon, unsure as to what to do."
31322,JON: I don't know how to ride a dragon.
31323,DAENERYS: Nobody does. Until they ride a dragon.
31324,JON: What if he doesn't want me to?
31325,"DAENERYS: Then I've enjoyed your company, Jon Snow."
31326,"NARRATOR:Defeated, JON walks around the side of RHAEGAL and then climbs on top whilst grunting."
31327,JON: What do I hold onto?
31328,DAENERYS: Whatever you can.
31329,"NARRATOR:JON grabs onto the dragon, which then proceeds to lift off whilst chittering. DAENERYS watches and smiles, before leaning forwards, cuing DROGON to follow suit. The dragons continue to fly higher, RHAEGAL turns side-to-side causing JON to yell out. They fly over the soldiers outside Winterfell and past TYRION, DAVOS and VARYS who are standing at the castle wall, staring in disbelief as they watch. DROGON flies ahead of RHAEGAL and continues higher before nosediving; RHAEGAL follows after his brother. They continue calmly before reaching a canyon, where the dragons dive straight down, before flying along the canyon floor. Once out of the canyon, RHAEGAL turns off, so DAENERYS instructs DROGON to do the same. She lands down next to JON. JON and DAENERYS, now dismounted from their dragons, walk together away from the dragons."
31330,JON: You've completely ruined horses for me.
31331,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS giggles and then notices a large waterfall, they stop."
31332,DAENERYS: We could stay a thousand years-
31333,NARRATOR:She turns back to look at JON.
31334,DAENERYS: No one would find us.
31335,JON: We'd be pretty old.
31336,NARRATOR:DAENERYS chuckles and the two walk up to one another.
31337,JON: It's cold up here for a southern girl.
31338,DAENERYS: So keep your queen warm.
31339,NARRATOR:JON pulls her in and kisses her. The dragons start to growl softly causing JON to pull away.
31340,DAENERYS: Don't be afraid.
31341,NARRATOR:They smile and continue their kiss in each other's embrace. JON opens his eyes to see DROGON staring at them.

31343,MAN 1: Gendry?
31344,MAN 2: He's here.
31345,NARRATOR:GENDRY hears and grabs a large axe made from dragonglass. He hands it over to SANDOR.
31346,GENDRY: It isn't easy making a blade that big with dragonglass.
31347,"SANDOR: You're saying you're good, is that it?"
31348,GENDRY: I'm just saying it's a tricky material to-
31349,SANDOR: You know who makes weapons for the wildlings? Cripples and cocksuckers. Which one are you?
31350,ARYA (O.S.): Leave him be.
31351,NARRATOR:GENDRY and SANDOR turn to see ARYA and stare at her.
31352,SANDOR: I heard you were here. You left me to die.
31353,ARYA: First I robbed you.
31354,"NARRATOR:SANDOR stands up and walks over to her, not breaking eye-contact."
31355,"SANDOR: You're a cold little bitch, aren't you? Guess that's why you're still alive."
31356,NARRATOR:SANDOR exits and GENDRY walks up to ARYA.
31357,ARYA: That was a nice ax you made for him. You've gotten better.
31358,"GENDRY: Yeah, thanks. So have you."
31359,NARRATOR:He pauses.
31360,"GENDRY: I mean, you look good."
31361,ARYA: Thanks. So do you.
31362,"NARRATOR:GENDRY pauses, he then walks away whilst still talking to her."
31363,"GENDRY: It's not a bad place to grow up, if it wasn't so cold."
31364,NARRATOR:ARYA follows.
31365,"ARYA: Stay close to that forge, then."
31366,"GENDRY: Is that a command, Lady Stark?"
31367,ARYA: Don't call me that.
31368,"GENDRY: As you wish, milady."
31369,NARRATOR:She smiles and chuckles.
31370,ARYA: Here's my wish.
31371,"NARRATOR:ARYA hands GENDRY a piece of parchment with a detachable spear drawn on it, with a dragonglass tip."
31372,ARYA: Can you make it?
31373,GENDRY: What do you need something like this for?
31374,ARYA: Can you make it or not?
31375,GENDRY: You already have a sword. What's that?
31376,NARRATOR:ARYA removes a Valyrian steel dagger from her person and hands it to him.
31377,GENDRY: It's Valyrian steel. I always knew you were just another rich girl.
31378,NARRATOR:ARYA smirks and takes the dagger back.
31379,ARYA: You don't know any other rich girls.

31381,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – SANSA'S QUARTERS
31382,NARRATOR:SANSA is reading a letter when there is a knock on the door.
31383,SANSA: Come in.
31384,NARRATOR:The door creaks open and then shuts. JON walks in before stopping next to her. SANSA sighs.
31385,"SANSA: Lord Glover wishes us good fortune, but he's staying in Deepwood Motte with his men."
31386,"JON: ""House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousand years."" Isn't that what he said?"
31387,"SANSA: ""I will stand behind Jon Snow,"" he said."
31388,NARRATOR:SANSA stands up and walks a bit before stopping and turning to look at him
31389,"SANSA: ""The King in the North."""
31390,JON: I told you we needed allies.
31391,SANSA: You didn't tell me you were going to abandon your crown.
31392,"JON: I never wanted a crown. All I wanted was to protect the North. I brought two armies home with me, two dragons."
31393,SANSA: And a Targaryen queen.
31394,NARRATOR:JON sighs.
31395,"JON: Do you think we can beat the Army of the Dead without her? I fought them, Sansa. Twice. You want to worry about who holds what title, I'm telling you it doesn't matter. Without her, we don't stand a chance."
31396,NARRATOR:They fall silent and JON sighs.
31397,JON: Do you have any faith in me at all?
31398,SANSA: You know I do.
31399,JON: She'll be a good queen. For all of us. She's not her father.
31400,NARRATOR:SANSA sighs.
31401,"SANSA: No, she's much prettier."
31402,NARRATOR:JON scoffs.
31403,SANSA: Did you bend the knee to save the North or because you love her?
31404,NARRATOR:He looks up at her.
31405,NARRATOR:A door creaks open and then shuts as DAENERYS and JORAH enter the library. They walk to where SAMWELL TARLY sits and JORAH nods in his direction. DAENERYS clears her throat.
31406,SAMWELL: Oh!
31407,"NARRATOR:Startled, SAMWELL stands up and dusts himself off."
31408,DAENERYS: So you're the man?
31409,"SAMWELL: Um. Which man am I, Your Grace?"
31410,DAENERYS: The one who saved Ser Jorah when no one else could.
31411,"JORAH: They could, they just wouldn't."
31412,DAENERYS: I'll have to make some changes in the Citadel when I take my throne. A great service merits a great reward.
31413,"SAMWELL: Oh, it's my honor to serve you, Your Grace."
31414,"DAENERYS: Well, there must be something I could give you."
31415,NARRATOR:SAMWELL nods.
31416,"SAMWELL: If it's not too much trouble, I could use a pardon."
31417,DAENERYS: For what crime?
31418,"SAMWELL: Um, I borrowed a few books from the Citadel."
31419,NARRATOR:JORAH and DAENERYS both smile to themselves.
31420,SAMWELL: And also a sword.
31421,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks at him, confused."
31422,DAENERYS: From the Citadel?
31423,SAMWELL: From my family. It's been in House Tarly for generations.
31424,NARRATOR:DAENERYS' face drops and she looks concerned.
31425,"SAMWELL: It would've been mine anyway, eventually, but my father had other ideas."
31426,DAENERYS: Not Randyll Tarly?
31427,SAMWELL: You know him?
31428,"NARRATOR:He looks at her, surprised. JORAH looks guilty."
31429,DAENERYS: I offered to let him retain his lands and titles if he bent the knee. He refused.
31430,NARRATOR:JORAH looks down as SAMWELL tried to hold it together. He gulps.
31431,"SAMWELL: Well At least I'll be allowed home again, now that my brother's the lord."
31432,NARRATOR:DAENERYS' face is stern.
31433,DAENERYS: Your brother stood with your father.
31434,NARRATOR:SAMWELL's lips start quivering and his breathe becomes shaky.
31435,DAENERYS: Of course.
31436,"NARRATOR:SAMWELL exits quickly, and DAENERYS and JORAH look at each other."
31437,NARRATOR:SAMWELL heads outside before being startled by a horse carrying a wagon. He stops and sees BRAN staring at him from across the courtyard. He walks over.
31438,SAMWELL: What are you doing out here?
31439,"BRAN: Waiting, for an old friend. It's time to tell Jon the truth."
31440,NARRATOR:SAMWELL shakes his head.
31441,"SAMWELL: No, no. You're his brother. Shouldn't you tell him?"
31442,BRAN: I'm not his brother. He trusts you more than anyone. Now's the time.
31443,"NARRATOR:JON blows out a candle and stands back to look at his father, EDDARD STARK's, statue. He sighs and hears a man grunting and a thud. He walks around the corner to see SAMWELL stand up."
31444,JON: Sam?
31445,"SAMWELL: I'm sorry, I know I'm not supposed to be down here."
31446,NARRATOR:JON grabs SAMWELL and hugs him tightly.
31447,JON: Were you hiding from me?
31448,SAMWELL: Of course not.
31449,JON: What are you doing in Winterfell? Or did you read every book in the Citadel already?
31450,NARRATOR:He looks at SAMWELL's face and sees he is worried.
31451,JON: What's wrong? Gilly? Is she all right?
31452,SAMWELL: She's good.
31453,JON: Little Sam?
31454,SAMWELL: Don't you know?
31455,JON: Know what?
31456,SAMWELL: Daenerys. She executed my father and brother. They were her prisoners.
31457,"NARRATOR:JON looks at SAMWELL, shocked at the news he was hearing."
31458,SAMWELL: She didn't tell you.
31459,JON: I'm so sorry. We need to end this war.
31460,SAMWELL: Would you have done it?
31461,"JON: Well, I've executed men who disobeyed me."
31462,SAMWELL: You've also spared men. Thousands of wildlings when they refused to kneel.
31463,JON: I wasn't a king.
31464,SAMWELL: But you were. You've always been.
31465,"JON: I gave up my crown, Sam."
31466,"NARRATOR:JON starts walking away, SAMWELL follows."
31467,JON: I bent the knee. I'm not King in the North anymore.
31468,SAMWELL: I'm not talking about the King in the North. I'm talking about the King of the bloody Seven Kingdoms.
31469,"NARRATOR:JON stops immediately, pauses and turns around."
31470,SAMWELL: Bran and I worked it out. I had a High Septon's diary. Bran had whatever Bran has.
31471,JON: What are you talking about?
31472,SAMWELL: Your mother was Lyanna Stark.
31473,NARRATOR:JON exhales sharply.
31474,JON: My father was the most honorable man I ever met. You're saying he lied to me all my life.
31475,NARRATOR:JON takes a couple of steps back whilst breathing heavily.
31476,JON: Daenerys is our queen.
31477,SAMWELL: She shouldn't be.
31478,JON: That's treason.
31479,SAMWELL: It's the truth. You gave up your crown to save your people. Would she do the same?
31480,"EDD: Stay back, he's got blue eyes!"
31481,TORMUND: I've always had blue eyes!
31482,NARRATOR:Everyone pauses and lowers their weapons.
31483,BERIC: Did you find anyone?
31484,"NARRATOR:EDD leads BERIC and TORMUND through a large hall, faintly illuminated by BERIC's ignited sword. When they reach the far wall there is a young boy impaled on the wall with several spirals of limbs surrounding him."
31485,EDD: The Umber boy.
31486,BERIC: It's a message. From the Night King.
31487,TORMUND: His army's between us and Winterfell. We're on foot.
31488,EDD: We rode down from Castle Black. We can double up on the horses.
31489,"TORMUND: If the horses last, we'll get there before the dead."
31490,NARRATOR:UMBER's eyes open.
31491,TORMUND: We just have to hope the Night King doesn't come first-
31492,"NARRATOR:UMBER starts shrieking, the three men start clamouring and BERIC shoves his sword in the boy, both igniting him and causing him to shriek even louder. The shrieking eventually stops, but not before the entire mosaic of appendages has been engulfed by flames."
31493,CUT TO: WINTERFELL
31494,NARRATOR:The cloaked man rides the horse up to the stable and dismounts as men around shout indistinctly. He removes his hood and JAIME LANNISTER's face is revealed. He sighs and looks around the courtyard before BRAN catches his eye. JAIME stares at him in disbelief at the camera zooms in on BRAN's face.
31495,NARRATOR:CREDITS
31496,NARRATOR:JAIME LANNISTER stands in the Great Hall of Winterfell.
31497,"DAENERYS TARGARYEN: When I was a child, my brother would tell me a bedtime story about the man who murdered our father."
31498,"NARRATOR:The camera cuts to a wide view of the hall and we see a multitude of guards placed around the room and the many who ally with House Stark. Sitting at the head of the room is DAENERYS in the centre of a long table; JON SNOW sits on her left and SANSA STARK on her right and JAIME is standing in the middle of the room facing DAENERYS. On the left of the room there is a shorter table where TYRION LANNISTER, LORD VARYS, MISSANDEI and JORAH MORMONT sit. On the right there is another table where DAVOS SEAWORTH, LYANNA MORMONT, LORD YOHN ROYCE, ALYS KARSTARK and BRIENNE OF TARTH sit"
31499,DAENERYS: Who stabbed him in the back and cut his throat. Who sat down on the Iron Throne and watched as his blood poured onto the floor.
31500,NARRATOR:JAIME’s eyes lowered.
31501,DAENERYS: He told me other stories as well. About all the things we would do to that man once we took back the Seven Kingdoms and had him in our grasp.
31502,NARRATOR:She pauses.
31503,DAENERYS: Your sister pledged to send her army north.
31504,JAIME: She did.
31505,"DAENERYS: I don't see an army. I see one man, with one hand. It appears your sister lied to me."
31506,NARRATOR:TYRION looks up at his brother and JAIME looks back.
31507,JAIME: She lied to me as well. She never had any intention of sending her army north.
31508,NARRATOR:DAENERYS turned her glare towards TYRION.
31509,"JAIME: She has Euron Greyjoy's fleet and 20,000 fresh troops. The Golden Company from Essos, bought and paid for. Even if we defeat the dead, she'll have more than enough to destroy the survivors."
31510,"DAENERYS: ""We""?"
31511,JAIME: I promised to fight for the living. I intend to keep that promise.
31512,NARRATOR:TYRION steps forwards towards DAENERYS.
31513,"TYRION: Your Grace, I know my brother-"
31514,DAENERYS: Like you knew your sister?
31515,"TYRION: He came here alone, knowing full well how he'd be received. Why would he do that if he weren't telling the truth?"
31516,"DAENERYS: Perhaps he trusts his little brother to defend him, right up to the moment he slits my throat."
31517,NARRATOR:TYRION looks to JON and SANSA.
31518,"SANSA: You're right. We can't trust him. He attacked my father in the streets. He tried to destroy my house and my family, the same as he did yours."
31519,"JAIME: Do you want me to apologize? I won't. We were at war. Everything I did, I did for my house and my family. I'd do it all again."
31520,BRAN: The things we do for love.
31521,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS, SANSA and JON all turn slowly to look at BRAN who sits to the side of SANSA. JAIME looks at him and BRAN maintains eye-contact."
31522,DAENERYS: So why have you abandoned your house and family now?
31523,JAIME: Because this goes beyond loyalty.
31524,"NARRATOR:He looks around to see BRIENNE, then turns back."
31525,JAIME: This is about survival.
31526,NARRATOR:TYRION turns to look at DAENERYS. BRIENNE then stands up.
31527,"BRIENNE: You don't know me well, Your Grace."
31528,NARRATOR:She walks from behind her table to stand in the middle of the Hall beside JAIME.
31529,"BRIENNE: But I know Ser Jaime. He is a man of honor. I was his captor once. But when we were both taken prisoner and the men holding us tried to force themselves on me, Ser Jaime defended me. And lost his hand because of it."
31530,NARRATOR:She then addresses SANSA.
31531,"BRIENNE: Without him, my lady, you would not be alive. He armed me, armored me, and sent me to find you and bring you home because he'd sworn an oath to your mother."
31532,NARRATOR:SANSA looks down and then back up at BRIENNE.
31533,SANSA: You vouch for him?
31534,BRIENNE: I do.
31535,SANSA: You would fight beside him?
31536,BRIENNE: I would.
31537,"SANSA: I trust you with my life. If you trust him with yours, we should let him stay."
31538,DAENERYS: What does the Warden of the North say about it?
31539,NARRATOR:She turns to JON who sighs.
31540,JON: We need every man we can get.
31541,NARRATOR:The room falls silent as DAENERYS thinks to herself.
31542,DAENERYS: Very well.
31543,"NARRATOR:TYRION exhales sharply in relief. GREY WORM picks up JAIME’s sword, walks over to him, handing it over aggressively."
31544,"JAIME: Thank you, Your Grace."
31545,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS stands up and the rest of the room does as she does. SANSA exits. DAENERYS turns to JON who exits after his sister. DAENERYS then exits followed by TYRION, VARYS, JORAH and MISSANDEI. JAIME then catches BRIENNE’s eye as she leaves and then he ends up looking at BRAN again who mimics his stare."
31546,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – HALLWAY
31547,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS walks along the hallway outside the hall followed by TYRION, VARYS and JORAH."
31548,"DAENERYS: Either you knew Cersei was lying and let me believe otherwise, or you didn't know at all. Which makes you either a traitor or a fool."
31549,TYRION: I was a fool.
31550,DAENERYS: Not for the first time.
31551,NARRATOR:DAENERYS stops walking and turns to TYRION.
31552,"DAENERYS: Cersei still sits on the throne. If you can't help me take it back, I'll find another Hand who can."
31553,NARRATOR:DAENERYS exits. TYRION turns to VARYS and JORAH.
31554,TYRION: I suspect one of you will be wearing this before it's all over.
31555,"NARRATOR:Men chatter indistinctly as they forge the weapons. GENDRY walks into frame, dumping dragonglass out of a bucket. He then walks up to furnace and pulls out some dragonglass, moulding it and then dousing it in a bucket of water. ARYA STARK walks towards him. As the steam rises from the bucket she catches his eye."
31556,GENDRY: Don't you have something better to do?
31557,ARYA: You make my weapon yet?
31558,GENDRY: Just as soon as I'm done making a few thousand of these.
31559,NARRATOR:GENDRY hands her a small axe with a blade made of dragonglass.
31560,ARYA: You should make mine first. And make sure it's stronger than this.
31561,NARRATOR:GENDRY grabs the axe and brings it down harshly on a wooden stump.
31562,GENDRY: It's strong enough.
31563,"NARRATOR:GENDRY moves to a pile of dragonglass spearheads and checks on it, ARYA follows."
31564,"GENDRY: It's going to be safer down in the crypt, you know."
31565,ARYA: Are you going to be down in the crypt?
31566,"GENDRY: No, but-"
31567,ARYA: But you're a fighter.
31568,NARRATOR:He glances up at her.
31569,GENDRY: I've done my share.
31570,ARYA: You've fought them?
31571,GENDRY: I did. Some of them.
31572,ARYA: How many?
31573,GENDRY: A few. That was enough.
31574,ARYA: What are they like?
31575,GENDRY: Bad. Really bad.
31576,"ARYA: ""Really bad""?"
31577,NARRATOR:She walks behind him and around the other side of the table so she is facing him.
31578,"ARYA: Even a smith's apprentice can do better than ""really bad."" What do they look like? What do they smell like? How do they move? How hard are they to kill?"
31579,"GENDRY: Look, I know you want to fight. And I know you're not scared of rapers or murderers or-This is different. This is-This is death. You want to know what they're like? Death. That's what they're like."
31580,"NARRATOR:ARYA picks up one of the spearheads, turning it in her hand."
31581,ARYA: I know Death.
31582,"NARRATOR:She throws the spearhead, narrowly missing a blacksmith’s head. GENDRY exhales, staring in disbelief at the dragonglass impaled on the wooden beam."
31583,ARYA: He's got many faces.
31584,NARRATOR:She tosses another landing next to the first. The blacksmith quickly runs away. GENDRY slowly turns back to ARYA who picks up a third spearhead.
31585,ARYA: I look forward to seeing this one.
31586,NARRATOR:She throws it and it lands with the first two. GENDRY chuckles to himself and ARYA walks back round the table and past GENDRY.
31587,ARYA: My weapon?
31588,GENDRY: I'll get right on it.
31589,NARRATOR:ARYA walks off as GENDRY watches. He smirks to himself.
31590,NARRATOR:The camera pans from behind a tree to show BRAN sitting in his wheelchair facing the weirwood tree. JAIME walks towards him. He stops a couple feet from him and looks down.
31591,JAIME: I'm sorry for what I did to you.
31592,NARRATOR:BRAN turns his head towards JAIME.
31593,BRAN: You weren't sorry then. You were protecting your family.
31594,NARRATOR:JAIME walks around in front of BRAN.
31595,JAIME: I'm not that person anymore.
31596,"BRAN: You still would be, if you hadn't pushed me out of that window. And I would still be Brandon Stark."
31597,JAIME: You're not?
31598,BRAN: No. I'm something else now.
31599,JAIME: You're not angry at me.
31600,BRAN: I'm not angry at anyone.
31601,JAIME: Why didn't you tell them?
31602,BRAN: You won't be able to help us in this fight if I let them murder you first.
31603,NARRATOR:JAIME nods and raises an eyebrow.
31604,JAIME: What about afterwards?
31605,BRAN: How do you know there is an afterwards?
31606,NARRATOR:JAIME stares at BRAN.
31607,NARRATOR:All of the northerners are busy building defences in preparation for the army of the dead as TYRION walks past. JAIME approaches him.
31608,"TYRION: Well, here we are."
31609,"JAIME: Yes, here we are."
31610,TYRION: Together again.
31611,NARRATOR:A man standing above them clears his throat and then spits on the floor beside them.
31612,TYRION: And the masses rejoice.
31613,JAIME: How do they feel about their new queen?
31614,TYRION: She's your new queen too.
31615,NARRATOR:They start walking together.
31616,TYRION: They remember what happened the last time Targaryens brought dragons north. They'll come around once they see Daenerys is different.
31617,JAIME: And she is? Different?
31618,TYRION: She is.
31619,JAIME: You're sure about her?
31620,TYRION: I am.
31621,JAIME: She didn't seem sure about you.
31622,TYRION: It's hard to blame her. I made a mistake common to clever people. I underestimated my opponents.
31623,JAIME: Hmm.
31624,TYRION: Cersei told me the pregnancy had changed her. A chance for you both to start again. And I believed her.
31625,NARRATOR:They stop walking and TYRION turns to look up at JAIME.
31626,TYRION: Was she lying about the baby too?
31627,"JAIME: No, that part is real."
31628,NARRATOR:TYRION thinks to himself and they both start walking again.
31629,JAIME: She's always been good at using the truth to tell lies. I wouldn't be too hard on yourself. She's fooled me more than anybody.
31630,NARRATOR:They start to walk up a staircase and TYRION turns to look at JAIME.
31631,JAIME: What?
31632,"TYRION: She never fooled you. You always knew exactly what she was, and you loved her anyway."
31633,"NARRATOR:TYRION walks ahead as JAIME remains in the same spot. After a couple seconds, he follows. They both walk along the walls of castle looking over the courtyard."
31634,"TYRION: So we're going to die at Winterfell. Not the death I would've chosen. I always pictured myself dying in my own bed, the age of 80, with a belly full of wine and-"
31635,BOTH: A girl's mouth around-
31636,JAIME: Your cock.
31637,TYRION: My cock.
31638,NARRATOR:TYRION smiles up at JAIME.
31639,TYRION: At least Cersei won't get to murder me. I'm sure I'll feel some satisfaction denying her that pleasure while I'm being ripped apart by dead men.
31640,NARRATOR:JAIME notices something whilst TYRION continues to talk and walks off.
31641,TYRION: Maybe after I'm dead I'll march down to King's Landing and rip her apart.
31642,"NARRATOR:TYRION glances up where JAIME was and notices he is gone, he looks behind to see JAIME looking over the wall. The camera cuts to show BRIENNE walking outside the walls among the Unsullied."
31643,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE
31644,"NARRATOR:GREY WORM is seen testing out the traps around the castle as other Unsullied and northerners work around him. JAIME walks out the front gate. We see PODRICK PAYNE training with a soldier as BRIENNE watches on, smiling proudly. JAIME stands next to her and she glances at him."
31645,BRIENNE: Ser Jaime.
31646,JAIME: Lady Brienne.
31647,"NARRATOR:PODRICK blocks the soldier and pushes him back, bettering him. They continue to fight with their swords."
31648,JAIME: He's come a long way.
31649,BRIENNE: He's all right. Still has a lot to learn.
31650,NARRATOR:BRIENNE starts walking away and JAIME follows.
31651,JAIME: I'm sure you'll teach him. I've been told you're commanding the left flank.
31652,"BRIENNE: I am. It's, uh-It's good ground."
31653,JAIME: It is.
31654,"BRIENNE: The rise, it should give us some advantage."
31655,NARRATOR:They stop walking.
31656,"BRIENNE: If we can keep a tight formation, we might be able to beat them back."
31657,"JAIME: Yes, I think you're right."
31658,NARRATOR:BRIENNE quickly turns to face JAIME.
31659,BRIENNE: What are you doing?
31660,JAIME: What?
31661,BRIENNE: I think you know.
31662,JAIME: I truly don't.
31663,BRIENNE: We have never had a conversation last this long without you insulting me. Not once.
31664,JAIME: You want me to insult you?
31665,BRIENNE: No!
31666,JAIME: Good.
31667,NARRATOR:He pauses.
31668,"JAIME: I came to Winterfell because-I'm not the fighter I used to be. But I'd be honored to serve under your command, if you'll have me."
31669,NARRATOR:BRIENNE goes silent and looks down briefly. She returns his gaze.
31670,BRIENNE: I better get back.
31671,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE walks off, leaving JAIME standing alone."
31672,NARRATOR:DAENERYS’ door opens and JORAH walks in.
31673,"JORAH: Forgive me, khaleesi."
31674,DAENERYS: Have you done something to offend me?
31675,JORAH: Many things.
31676,DAENERYS: Long ago and long forgiven.
31677,"JORAH: But you did forgive, despite my failures. When I heard you'd named Tyrion your Hand, it broke my heart."
31678,"DAENERYS: When I named him Hand, I didn't know if I'd ever see you again."
31679,JORAH: You made the right choice.
31680,DAENERYS: I wasn't under the impression you liked him very much.
31681,JORAH: I didn't. His mouth hardly stopped moving between Volantis and Meereen. It was all I could do not to throw him in the sea.
31682,NARRATOR:JORAH chuckles.
31683,JORAH: But the mind behind all those words-
31684,DAENERYS: He's made mistakes. Serious mistakes.
31685,JORAH: As have we all. He owns his and learns from them.
31686,DAENERYS: You're advising me to forgive the man who stole your position?
31687,"JORAH: I am. And one other suggestion, if you'll allow me."
31688,NARRATOR:DAENERYS walks into the library.
31689,"ROYCE: The moment we can get the last infantryman out onto the field, we should shut the gates."
31690,NARRATOR:The camera pans to show ROYCE and SANSA sitting at a table together.
31691,SANSA: Keep them open for as long as you can. There are still people coming in from the countryside.
31692,NARRATOR:They both notice DAENERYS’ presence and stand up.
31693,"DAENERYS: Lady Sansa, I was hoping we could speak alone."
31694,"NARRATOR:ROYCE looks at SANSA who nods, granting him leave. ROYCE walks towards DAENERYS, bows and then exits. DAENERYS turns to watch him leave before turning back."
31695,DAENERYS: I thought you and I were on the verge of agreement before. About Ser Jaime.
31696,"SANSA: Brienne has been loyal to me, always. I trust her more than anyone."
31697,DAENERYS: I wish I could have that kind of faith in my advisors.
31698,SANSA: Tyrion is a good man. He was never anything but decent towards me.
31699,DAENERYS: I didn't ask him to be my Hand simply because he was good.
31700,NARRATOR:She starts walking towards SANSA.
31701,"DAENERYS: I asked him to be my Hand because he was good, and intelligent, and ruthless when he had to be. He never should have trusted Cersei."
31702,SANSA: You never should have either.
31703,DAENERYS: I thought he knew his sister.
31704,SANSA: Families are complicated.
31705,DAENERYS: Ours certainly have been.
31706,NARRATOR:They both sit down in the seats SANSA and ROYCE were previously occupying.
31707,SANSA: A sad thing to have in common.
31708,"DAENERYS: We have other things in common. We've both known what it means to lead people who aren't inclined to accept a woman's rule. And we've both done a damn good job of it, from what I can tell."
31709,NARRATOR:SANSA returns her uneasy smile.
31710,"DAENERYS: And yet, I can't help but feel we're at odds with one another. Why is that? Your brother."
31711,"SANSA: He loves you, you know that."
31712,DAENERYS: That bothers you.
31713,SANSA: Men do stupid things for women. They're easily manipulated.
31714,"DAENERYS: All my life, I've known one goal: the Iron Throne. Taking it back from the people who destroyed my family, and almost destroyed yours. My war was against them. Until I met Jon. Now I'm here, half a world away, fighting Jon's war alongside him. Tell me, who manipulated whom?"
31715,NARRATOR:SANSA scoffs; she then leans forward and places her hand on DAENERYS’ hand.
31716,SANSA: I should have thanked you the moment you arrived. That was a mistake.
31717,NARRATOR:DAENERYS places her other hand on top of SANSA’s.
31718,"DAENERYS: I'm here because I love your brother and I trust him, and I know he's true to his word. He's only the second man in my life I can say that about."
31719,SANSA: Who was the first?
31720,DAENERYS: Someone taller.
31721,NARRATOR:They both chuckle with one another.
31722,"SANSA: And what happens afterwards? We defeat the dead, we destroy Cersei. What happens then?"
31723,DAENERYS: I take the Iron Throne.
31724,"SANSA: What about the North? It was taken from us, and we took it back. And we said we'd never bow to anyone else again. What about the North?"
31725,NARRATOR:DAENERYS removes her hand and looks away from SANSA. MAESTER WOLKAN enters the library.
31726,"WOLKAN: Apologies, my lady. Your Grace."
31727,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns in her seat, agitated."
31728,DAENERYS: What is it?
31729,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL
31730,"NARRATOR:WOLKAN leads DAENERYS and SANSA into the great hall, where we see THEON GREYJOY standing in the centre of the hall surrounded by many of the Ironborn. DAENERYS looks shocked, THEON walks up to her and bends his knee."
31731,THEON: My queen.
31732,DAENERYS: Your sister?
31733,"THEON: She only has a few ships, and she couldn't sail them here. So, she's sailing to the Iron Islands instead, to take them back in your name."
31734,DAENERYS: But why aren't you with her?
31735,NARRATOR:THEON looks at SANSA.
31736,"THEON: I want to fight for Winterfell, Lady Sansa, if you'll have me."
31737,NARRATOR:SANSA walks up to THEON quickly and hugs him tightly. THEON hugs back.
31738,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – COURTYARD
31739,NARRATOR:Many northerners wait in line to be served food. DAVOS is filling the bowls.
31740,"MAN: Milord, we're not soldiers."
31741,"DAVOS: You are now. Look, I made it through most of my years without ever getting near a fight, but then I survived the Battle of the Bastards. Right outside these walls. If I can live through that, you can live through this. They'll outfit you with weapons at the forge. Right that way."
31742,MAN: Thank you.
31743,NARRATOR:He nods towards DAVOS and walks off with his bowl.
31744,"GILLY: When the time comes, you'll be down in the crypts."
31745,"NARRATOR:The camera pans to show GILLY leading a young woman and an older couple, showing them where they will stay during the battle."
31746,GILLY: They're the safest place to be. Through that archway right over there.
31747,WOMAN: Thank you.
31748,"NARRATOR:TEELA, a young girl, walks up to where the food is being served and holds her bowl up. DAVOS has his back turned."
31749,TEELA: Which way should I go?
31750,NARRATOR:DAVOS turns back around and looks at her.
31751,DAVOS: Which way do you want to go?
31752,TEELA: All the children will be going below when the time comes.
31753,NARRATOR:GILLY overhears the conversation and starts to walk over.
31754,TEELA: But both me brothers were soldiers. I want to fight too.
31755,NARRATOR:DAVOS takes her bowl and fills it up as GILLY sits down next to her.
31756,"GILLY: That's good to hear. I'm going to be in the crypt with my son, and I'd feel a lot better with you down there to protect us."
31757,DAVOS: I'm sure a lot of people would.
31758,NARRATOR:He hands her bowl back to her.
31759,"TEELA: All right. I'll defend the crypt, then."
31760,"NARRATOR:TEELA walks off and DAVOS smiles at GILLY. A horn is then blared and the gates are opened as the remaining members of the nights watch return with TORMUND GIANTSBANE and BERIC DONDARRION. SAMWELL TARLY greets DOLOROUS EDD who has just returned. JON sees them and quickly heads over. Before he can embrace EDD, TORMUND hugs him first."
31761,TORMUND: My little crow.
31762,JON: I thought we'd lost you.
31763,TORMUND: Almost.
31764,NARRATOR:JON turns to hug EDD. He then turn to BERIC and shakes his hand.
31765,JON: How did you find each other?
31766,EDD: We met up at the Last Hearth.
31767,TORMUND: The dead got there first.
31768,JON: The Umbers?
31769,BERIC: Fighting for the Night King now.
31770,TORMUND: We had to travel around them to get here. Whoever's not here now is with them.
31771,JON: How long do we have?
31772,TORMUND: Before the sun comes up tomorrow.
31773,"NARRATOR:JON looks at SAMWELL with a concerned look. TORMUND looks back over his shoulder, surveying his surroundings."
31774,TORMUND: The big woman still here?
31775,NARRATOR:Northern soldiers jog around the walls of Winterfell
31776,JON (V.O.): They're coming.
31777,NARRATOR:Men are removing dragonglass weapons from carriages and handing to soldier. The camera pans and GENDRY lifts a dragonglass axe up and hands it to a man.
31778,JON (V.O.): We have dragonglass and Valyrian steel.
31779,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE
31780,"NARRATOR:The Unsullied pull ropes, causing a large boulder to be thrown into the air by a large trebuchet. More soldiers march out of the gates of Winterfell."
31781,JON(V.O.): But there are too many of them.
31782,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – BATTLEMENTS
31783,NARRATOR:Archers walk up to the edge of the battlements with their bow and arrows. We see a man stretch the bow string
31784,JON (V.O.): Far too many.
31785,NARRATOR:A horse neighs and the man looks up over the wall.
31786,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – FRONT GATE
31787,NARRATOR:The Dothraki ride along the outside of the wall as the camera pans past the trench of spikes used to defend from the Army of the Dead.
31788,JON (V.O.): Our enemy doesn't tire.
31789,"NARRATOR:The camera moves farther down until it reaches a gap in the trench outside the gate, the Dothraki ride through the center as Unsullied soldiers emerge from the gate."
31790,JON (V.O.): Doesn't stop. Doesn't feel.
31791,"NARRATOR:In the library, a large table has a map of Winterfell laid out over it, with various markers placed outside the castle. The Unsullied are organized in three groups in the middle outside the front of the. To either side of the Unsullied are markers representing the Northerners and in front are the Dothraki. Facing towards all these troops are markers representing the Army of the Dead, these markers far outnumber the allies of Winterfell. Standing around the table (clockwise) is SANSA, JON, ARYA, SAMWELL, THEON, ALYS, BRIENNE, JAIME, BERIC, TORMUND, DAVOS, LYANNA, ROYCE, QHONO, GREY WORM, VARYS, DAENERYS, JORAH and TYRION. BRAN is seated behind JON."
31792,JON: We can't beat them in a straight fight.
31793,"JAIME: So, what can we do?"
31794,JON: The Night King made them all. They follow his command. If he falls Getting to him may be our best chance.
31795,"JAIME: If that's true, he'll never expose himself."
31796,"BRAN: Yes, he will."
31797,NARRATOR:Everyone in the room turns to look at Bran.
31798,"BRAN: He'll come for me. He's tried before, many times, with many Three-Eyed Ravens."
31799,SAMWELL: Why? What does he want?
31800,"BRAN: An endless night. He wants to erase this world, and I am its memory."
31801,"SAMWELL: That's what death is, isn't it? Forgetting. Being forgotten. If we forget where we've been and what we've done, we're not men anymore. Just animals. Your memories don't come from books. Your stories aren't just stories. If I wanted to erase the world of men, I'd start with you."
31802,TYRION: How will he find you?
31803,BRAN: His mark is on me.
31804,"NARRATOR:BRAN lifts the cuff of his right arm, revealing a red mark in the shape of a hand."
31805,BRAN: He always knows where I am.
31806,"JON: We'll put you in the crypt, where it's safest."
31807,BRAN: No. We need to lure him into the open before his army destroys us all. I'll wait for him in the Godswood.
31808,"NARRATOR:The camera pans over the map of Winterfell, to the East, yet still within the walls, is the Godswood."
31809,SANSA: You want us to use you as bait?
31810,ARYA: We're not leaving you alone out there.
31811,THEON: He won't be. I'll stay with him. With the Ironborn. I took this castle from you. Let me defend you now.
31812,DAVOS: We'll hold off the rest of them for as long as we can.
31813,"TYRION: When the time comes, Ser Davos and I will be on the walls, to give you the signal to light the trench."
31814,DAENERYS: Ser Davos is perfectly capable of waving a torch on his own. You'll be in the crypt.
31815,NARRATOR:TYRION looks shocked and turns to her.
31816,"TYRION: Your Grace, I have fought before, I can do it again. Alongside the men and women risking their lives."
31817,"DAENERYS: There are thousands of them and only one of you. You can't fight as well as they can, but you can think better than any of them. You're here because of your mind. If we survive, I'll need it."
31818,NARRATOR:TYRION nods.
31819,DAVOS: The dragons should give us an edge in the field.
31820,"JON: If they're in the field, they're not protecting Bran. We need to be near him. Not too near, or the Night King won't come. But close enough to pursue him when he does."
31821,ARYA: Dragonfire will stop him?
31822,BRAN: I don't know. No one's ever tried.
31823,TORMUND: We're all going to die.
31824,NARRATOR:He turns to look at BRIENNE.
31825,TORMUND: But at least we die together.
31826,JON: Let's get some rest.
31827,NARRATOR:Everyone begins to leave the library as JON and DAENERYS remain at the table.
31828,JON: Your Grace.
31829,NARRATOR:JON then exits along with almost everyone else. Only TYRION and BRAN remain.
31830,TYRION: Do you need help?
31831,BRAN: No.
31832,TYRION: You've had a strange journey.
31833,BRAN: Stranger than most.
31834,TYRION: I'd like to hear about it.
31835,NARRATOR:TYRION grabs a wooden chair and drags it over next to BRAN.
31836,BRAN: It's a long story.
31837,NARRATOR:TYRION sits in the chair.
31838,"TYRION: If only we were trapped in a castle in the middle of winter, with nowhere to go."
31839,NARRATOR:Unsullied soldiers clean their weapons as GREY WORM walks past. MISSANDEI walks into the courtyard and sees two young girls.
31840,MISSANDEI: Hello.
31841,NARRATOR:The girls quickly grab one another’s hands and run off. GREY WORM stands behind her as she turns around to face him. GREY WORM walks up to her.
31842,"GREY WORM: When Daenerys takes her throne there will be no place for us here. I am loyal to my queen. I will fight for her until her enemies are defeated, but when the war is over and she has won, do you want to grow old in this place? Is there nothing else you want to do, nothing else you want to see?"
31843,MISSANDEI: Naath. I'd like to see the beaches again.
31844,GREY WORM: Then I will take you there.
31845,MISSANDEI: My people are peaceful. We cannot protect ourselves.
31846,GREY WORM: My people are not peaceful. We will protect you.
31847,"NARRATOR:The camera pans up over the wall and SAMWELL and JON stand next to each other with GHOST, JON’s direwolf, behind them. SAMWELL leans over slightly towards JON."
31848,SAMWELL: Have you told her yet?
31849,JON: No.
31850,SAMWELL: Mm-hmm. Being careful. Biding your time. Waiting for the perfect-
31851,NARRATOR:He pauses and they both look at each other and fall silent. EDD walks up the stair behind them and stands between them.
31852,EDD: And now our watch begins.
31853,JON: Gilly? Little Sam?
31854,SAMWELL: They'll be safe down in the crypt.
31855,JON: If you want to join them.
31856,NARRATOR:SAMWELL looks at him and frowns.
31857,JON: To protect them.
31858,SAMWELL: Everyone seems to forget that I was the first man to kill a White Walker. I've killed Thenns.
31859,EDD: Thenn.
31860,"SAMWELL: I've saved Gilly more than once. I stole a considerable number of books from the Citadel library, survived the Fist of the First Men. You need me out there."
31861,"EDD: Well, if that's what it's come to, we really are fucked."
31862,"SAMWELL: Well, calling you ""fucked"" wouldn't be strictly accurate."
31863,NARRATOR:SAMWELL chuckles and EDD looks at him. He turns to see JON laughing too.
31864,EDD: Samwell Tarly. Slayer of White Walkers. Lover of Ladies. As if we needed any more signs the world was ending.
31865,NARRATOR:SAMWELL sighs.
31866,"SAMWELL: Think back to where we started. Us, Grenn, Pyp."
31867,JON: Now it's just us three.
31868,"EDD: Last man left, burn the rest of us."
31869,NARRATOR:The camera rises over the wall and the silhouette of the trees in the distance block the light slowly fading over the horizon.
31870,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL
31871,"NARRATOR:The fire in the hearth of the hall is lit. Two wooden chairs sit facing it, occupied by JAIME to the left of the fire and TYRION to the right. They both sip on wine."
31872,TYRION: I wish Father were here.
31873,NARRATOR:JAIME looks at TYRION in shock.
31874,TYRION: I would love to see the look on his face when he realizes his two sons are about to die defending Winterfell.
31875,NARRATOR:JAIME snorts.
31876,JAIME: That would be something to see.
31877,"TYRION: I remember the first time we were here, the first time I saw this hall."
31878,JAIME: Mm.
31879,TYRION: You were a golden lion. I was a drunken whore-monger. It was all so simple.
31880,JAIME: It wasn't so simple. I was sleeping with my sister and you had one friend in the world who was sleeping with his sister.
31881,TYRION: I was speaking in relative terms.
31882,JAIME: Do you miss it?
31883,TYRION: Of course I miss it.
31884,"JAIME: Well, my golden-lion days are done, but whore-mongering is still an option for you."
31885,NARRATOR:TYRION sighs
31886,TYRION: It's not. Things would be easier if it were.
31887,NARRATOR:TYRION raises his cup to toast.
31888,TYRION: The perils of self-betterment.
31889,NARRATOR:JAIME raises his and they both go to drink. JAIME stops himself when the door to the hall opens and BRIENNE and PODRICK walk in. JAIME stands up quickly and they both turn to look at the visitors.
31890,JAIME: Oh! My lady.
31891,"BRIENNE: Oh, we didn't mean to interrupt. We were just looking for somewhere warm to-"
31892,TYRION: To contemplate your imminent death. You've come to the right place. You want some of this piss? It's not bad. It's not good either.
31893,"NARRATOR:TYRION walks over to where the wine is kept, PODRICK starts to walk to him."
31894,"PODRICK: Thank you, milord."
31895,BRIENNE: I don't think that's wise.
31896,NARRATOR:PODRICK turns back to BRIENNE.
31897,BRIENNE: The battle might start at any moment.
31898,NARRATOR:She pauses.
31899,BRIENNE: Half cup.
31900,TYRION: And you?
31901,NARRATOR:TYRION continues to pour PODRICK’s drink until the cup overflows with wine.
31902,"BRIENNE: No, thank you. I should try and get some sleep."
31903,JAIME: You really think any of us are going to sleep tonight? Join us.
31904,NARRATOR:JAIME places another chair in front of the fire.
31905,BRIENNE: All right. Just a bit.
31906,NARRATOR:TYRION pours BRIENNE a drink and hands it to her as she sits down. PODRICK grabs a chair and brings it over and sits down. DAVOS and TORMUND enter the hall.
31907,"DAVOS: Well, what do we have here?"
31908,"TYRION: Ser Davos, join us."
31909,"DAVOS: No, not for me, thanks. Came here for this."
31910,NARRATOR:DAVOS stands in front of the fire to warm up.
31911,DAVOS: I figured I could wait to die freezing my balls off out there or wait to die nice and warm in here.
31912,NARRATOR:TORMUND walks up to BRIENNE and stands in front of her.
31913,"TORMUND: It could be our last night in this world, you know."
31914,"NARRATOR:JAIME, now sitting down next to BRIENNE, glances up."
31915,"BRIENNE: Yes, well, I'm glad you're here."
31916,NARRATOR:She pauses and quickly tries to recover.
31917,BRIENNE: Here fighting with us. Glad you survived Eastwatch.
31918,TYRION: Would you like a drink?

31920,TORMUND: Brought my own.
31921,"NARRATOR:TORMUND looks at JAIME, over to BRIENNE, and then back to JAIME again."
31922,"TORMUND: They call you ""King Killer."""
31923,JAIME: I'm sure someone does.
31924,"TORMUND: They call me ""Giantsbane."" Want to know why?"
31925,NARRATOR:JAIME sighs and looks over at TYRION who is still standing to the side of the room with his wine. TORMUND grabs a wooden chair and places it with his back to the fire so that he is facing JAIME and BRIENNE. He sits down and leans forwards.
31926,TORMUND: I killed a giant when I was 10. Then I climbed right into bed with his wife.
31927,"NARRATOR:DAVOS glances at TORMUND, clearly perplexed."
31928,"TORMUND: When she woke up, you know what she did? Suckled me at her teat for three months. Thought I was her baby. That's how I got so strong. Giant's milk."
31929,"NARRATOR:TORMUND raises the horn to his mouth and starts drinking from it whilst gulping noisily. Everyone stares at him as the drink pours out the horn, mostly down his front."
31930,DAVOS: Maybe I will have that drink.
31931,NARRATOR:SANDOR “THE HOUND” CLEGANE sits with back against the battlements drinking alone. ARYA walks up to him and he notices her. She walks closer and SANDOR silently offers the drink. ARYA sits down next to SANDOR and takes a swig. They sit silently staring ahead.
31932,SANDOR: You never used to shut up. Now you're just sitting there like a mute.
31933,ARYA: Guess I've changed.
31934,NARRATOR:She pauses.
31935,ARYA: What are you doing up here?
31936,SANDOR: What's it look like?
31937,"ARYA: No, I mean, what are you doing up here? You joined the Brotherhood. You went beyond the Wall with Jon. You're here now. Why? When was the last time you fought for anyone but yourself?"
31938,NARRATOR:SANDOR turns to her.
31939,"SANDOR: I fought for you, didn't I?"
31940,NARRATOR:BERIC walks up to the two of them and stops in front of them.
31941,"SANDOR: Oh, for fuck's sake. May as well be at a bloody wedding."
31942,NARRATOR:BERIC smiles. He turns to look at ARYA.
31943,BERIC: My lady. It's good to see you again. I'm sorry we parted the way we did.
31944,NARRATOR:SANDOR turns to ARYA.
31945,SANDOR: Was he on your list?
31946,ARYA: For a little while.
31947,BERIC: That's all right.
31948,NARRATOR:BERIC sits down on a barrel opposite the two.
31949,BERIC: The Lord of Light has brought us together all the same. This is his moment. When light-
31950,"SANDOR: Thoros isn't here anymore, so I hope you're not about to give a sermon. Because if you are, the Lord of Light's gonna wonder why he brought you back 19 times just to watch you die when I chuck you over this fucking wall."
31951,NARRATOR:He points to the wall he’s leaning against. BERIC chuckles and holds his hand out. SANDOR passes him the drink. ARYA stands up and starts walking away from them.
31952,SANDOR: Where are you going?
31953,NARRATOR:ARYA turns around to look at them.
31954,ARYA: I'm not spending my final hours with you two miserable old shits.
31955,NARRATOR:ARYA exits and SANDOR and BERIC sit in silence.
31956,NARRATOR:A bowstring creaks as an arrow is fired. It hits its target next to two other arrows previously shot. The camera cuts to see ARYA holding a large bow in a dimly lit hallway. She lowers it and picks up another arrow. GENDRY watches from a doorway. She fires another arrow and turns as GENDRY walks up to her.
31957,ARYA: That for me?
31958,NARRATOR:GENDRY raises a spear with a dragonglass head. ARYA lays down her bow and takes the spear.
31959,ARYA: This'll work.
31960,"GENDRY: Last time you saw me, you wanted me to come to Winterfell. Took the long road, but…"
31961,ARYA: What did the Red Woman want with you?
31962,GENDRY: She wanted my blood for some kind of spell.
31963,ARYA: Why your blood?
31964,"GENDRY: I'm Robert Baratheon's bastard. I didn't know until she told me. Then she tied me up, stripped me down, put leeches all over me."
31965,ARYA: Was that your first time?
31966,"GENDRY: No, yeah, I've never had leeches put all over my cock."
31967,ARYA: Your first time with a woman.
31968,GENDRY: What? I-I didn't-I wasn't with her.
31969,ARYA: Were you with other girls before that in King's Landing?
31970,NARRATOR:GENDRY scoffs.
31971,ARYA: Or after?
31972,NARRATOR:GENDRY stammers indistinctly.
31973,ARYA: You don't remember?
31974,NARRATOR:GENDRY scoffs.
31975,"GENDRY: Yes, I was."
31976,ARYA: One? Two? Twenty?

31978,"ARYA: Yes, you did."
31979,NARRATOR:GENDRY sighs.
31980,GENDRY: Three.
31981,NARRATOR:ARYA pauses and walks up to him.
31982,ARYA: We're probably going to die soon. I want to know what it's like before that happens.
31983,"GENDRY: Arya, I-"
31984,"NARRATOR:ARYA inhales sharply as she pulls GENDRY in and starts kissing him. They start undressing themselves and each other whilst still kissing. She pushes GENDRY back onto a pile of bags as she takes off her top. GENDRY, who is still just wearing his pants, notices a couple scars on ARYA’s side."
31985,ARYA: I'm not the Red Woman. Take your own bloody pants off.
31986,NARRATOR:She pulls her own pants off and climbs on top of GENDRY and starts kissing him.
31987,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – GREAT HALL
31988,"NARRATOR:The fire is still lit and the people who were in there earlier still sit there. Opposite the fire sits (from left to right) TORMUND, BRIENNE, JAIME, DAVOS, TYRION and PODRICK. They sit in silence before TYRION breaks it."
31989,"TYRION: It's strange, isn't it? Almost everyone here's fought the Starks at one time or another. And here we are in their castle, ready to defend it. Together."
31990,BRIENNE: At least we'll die with honor.
31991,TYRION: I think we might live.
31992,NARRATOR:DAVOS and PODRICK both start laughing.
31993,TYRION: I-I do. How many battles have we survived between us? Ser Davos Seaworth. Survivor of both the Blackwater and the Battle of the Bastards.

31995,"TYRION: Mm. Ser Jaime Lannister, fabled hero of the Siege of Pyke."

31997,NARRATOR:JAIME stands up to get himself another drink.
31998,"TYRION: Hear, hear! Ser Brienne of Tarth. Defeated the Hound in-Pardon me, Lady Brienne."
31999,TORMUND: She's not a ser? You're not a knight?
32000,BRIENNE: Women can't be knights.
32001,TORMUND: Why not?
32002,BRIENNE: Tradition.
32003,TORMUND: Fuck tradition.
32004,BRIENNE: I don't even want to be a knight.
32005,"NARRATOR:PODRICK looks at her, slightly confused. BRIENNE ignores him."
32006,"TORMUND: I'm no king. But if I were, I'd knight you 10 times over."

32008,NARRATOR:JAIME places his cup on the table where the wine is kept.
32009,JAIME: I'll prove it.
32010,NARRATOR:JAIME unsheathes his sword and stands in the middle of the room and holds his sword out.
32011,"JAIME: Kneel, Lady Brienne."
32012,NARRATOR:BRIENNE scoffs.
32013,JAIME: Do you want to be a knight or not? Kneel.
32014,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE looks at PODRICK who nods. She stands up, walks to the middle of the room opposite JAIME and kneels before him. PODRICK and DAVOS both turn in their seats to see and TYRION and TORMUND both stand. JAIME places the sword on her right shoulder."
32015,"JAIME: In the name of the Warrior, I charge you to be brave."
32016,NARRATOR:He raises it over her head and places it on her left shoulder.
32017,"JAIME: In the name of the Father, I charge you to be just."

32022,NARRATOR:BRIENNE smiles as she stands up and the rest of the room all applaud.
32023,TYRION: Ser Brienne of Tarth! Knight of the Seven Kingdoms!
32024,NARRATOR:BRIENNE smiles ecstatically.

32044,JORAH: You still have a family.
32045,"SAMWELL: Yes. And I'd love to defend them with it. But I can't really hold it upright. Your father, he taught me how to be a man. How to do what's right. This is right. It's Valyrian steel. I'd be honored if you'd take it."
32046,NARRATOR:He hands JORAH the sword and JORAH removes it from its sheath slightly to examine it.
32047,JORAH: I'll wield it in his memory to guard the realms of men.

32055,DAVOS: We're out of wine.
32056,NARRATOR:DAVOS sits back down.
32057,TYRION: How about a song? One of you must know one. Ser Davos?

32074,PODRICK (V.O.): Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
32075,CUT TO: WINTERFELL – OUTSIDE FRONT GATE
32076,NARRATOR:Everyone gathers outside the castle as they prepare for battle. JORAH rides on his horse and gazes at the horizon to see only darkness. PODRICK’s singing continues.
32077,PODRICK (V.O.): Never wanted to leave. Never wanted to leave.
32078,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS turns a corner as she sees JON staring at a statute of his biological mother, LYANNA STARK. She walks up to him. He glances at her and smiles as she walks closer. She holds his arm as they both look at the statute together."

32080,JON: Lyanna Stark.
32081,NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks troubled.
32082,"DAENERYS: My brother, Rhaegar, everyone told me he was decent and kind. He liked to sing. Gave money to poor children. And he raped her."
32083,JON: He didn't. He loved her.
32084,NARRATOR:JON turns to face DAENERYS.
32085,"JON: They were married in secret. After Rhaegar fell on the Trident, she had a son. Robert would have murdered the baby if he ever found out, and Lyanna knew it. So the last thing she did, as she bled to death on her birthing bed, was give the boy to her brother, Ned Stark, to raise as his bastard."
32086,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS starts to look at him, slightly concerned."
32087,JON: My name. My real name is Aegon Targaryen.
32088,NARRATOR:DAENERYS exhales sharply as she pulls away.
32089,DAENERYS: That's impossible.
32090,JON: I wish it were.
32091,DAENERYS: Who told you this?
32092,JON: Bran. He saw it.
32093,DAENERYS: He saw it?
32094,JON: And Samwell confirmed it. He read about their marriage at the Citadel without even knowing what it meant.
32095,DAENERYS: A secret no one in the world knew except your brother and your best friend. Doesn't seem strange to you?
32096,"JON: It's true, Dany. I know it is."
32097,"DAENERYS: If it were true, it would make you the last male heir of House Targaryen. You'd have a claim to the Iron Throne."
32098,NARRATOR:Suddenly a horn blares and JON turns around.

32110,"NARRATOR:JORAH's body lies on an unlit funeral pyre. DAENERYS looks down on his prone body, crying in mourning. She leans down and kisses him gently on the forehead. She then whispers something in his ear."
32111,"NARRATOR:SANSA weeps over THEON’s dead body, her hand on his chest. She steps back and takes a Stark wolf pin from her chest and secures it on THEON's."
32112,"NARRATOR:JON, ARYA, SAM and BRAN stand amidst the Stark men, some of whom bear torches. DAENERYS joins the crowd a bit further down, next to GREY WORM, VARYS, MISSANDEI and TYRION. In front of the crowd sits scores of funeral pyres in a grid. Stark soldiers stand at intervals with more torches. SANSA returns to the somber crowd, joining her siblings. Even Grey Wolf stands obediently in mourning. JON steps forward to address those assembled."
32113,JON: We're here to say goodbye to our  brothers and sisters. To our fathers and mothers. To our friends. Our fellow men and women who set aside their differences to fight together and die together so that others might live. Everyone in this world owes them a debt that can never be repaid. It is our duty and our honor to keep them alive in memory for those who come after us and those who come after them for as long as men draw breath. They were the shields that guarded the realms of men. And we shall never see their like again.
32114,"Soldiers and freefolk hand torches to JON, SANSA, ARYA, SAM, TORMUND, DAENERYS and GREY WORM. They fan out to various pyres in the field, joining their fallen comrades for one final VISIT: ARYA  to BERIC, SAM to EDDISON TOLLETT, JON to LYANNA MORMONT. JON looks at DAENERYS. As one, they ignite the pyres. DAENYRYS watches the flames spread under JORAH, then turns away. The living return to the crowd and the flames rise higher. The air fills with a thick black smoke."

32121,GENDRY: I just want to thank her for--
32122,HOUND: I'm sure you do.
32123,"GENDRY: Look, it's not about that."
32124,"HOUND: Of course it's about that, you twat. Why shouldn't it be? The dead are dead. You're not."
32125,"NARRATOR:The HOUND takes a deep gulp of his wine. GENDRY gets up, insulted. He walks the length of the hall to exit, but DAENERYS notices him as he passes the head table."

32133,DAENERYS: You are aware he took my family's throne and tried to have me murdered?
32134,GENDRY: I didn’t even know he was my father until after he was dead.
32135,"DAENERYS: Yes, he's dead. His brothers are too. So who's Lord of Storm's End now?"

32137,DAENERYS: Does anyone?
32138,NARRATOR:No one in the hall responds.

32140,NARRATOR:The crowd murmurs.
32141,GENDRY: I can't be. I'm a bastard.

32165,NARRATOR:The mood has lightened. The merry crowd laughs and enjoys themselves. The wine flows freely. A server places a carafe of wine on the table in front of JAIME and BRIENNE.

32172,DAVOS:  I did. I do.
32173,TYRION:   So did you?
32174,"DAVOS: Never got the chance. She did it to herself. Or her god did it to her. Lord of Light. We play his game for him, we fight his war and win, and then he fucks off. No signs, no blessings. Who knows what he wants?"
32175,TYRION:  I don't imagine thinking about that subject will leave you any happier than before.
32176,DAVOS: And what if I'm not trying to be happy?
32177,"TYRION: Then you're in luck. We may have defeated them, but we still have us to contend with."

32184,MAN: More ale!
32185,"NARRATOR:TYRION address BRAN, who sits nearby."
32186,TYRION: This is clever. Even better than the saddle I designed for you.
32187,BRAN: It's the same as the one Daeron Targaryen built for his crippled nephew 120 years ago. I liked that one.
32188,TYRION: You know our history better than anyone. That will be useful as Lord of Winterfell.
32189,BRAN: I'm not Lord of Winterfell.
32190,TYRION: You're the only surviving trueborn son of Ned Stark.
32191,NARRATOR:BRAN doesn't answer.

32249,NARRATOR:DAENERYS grows more unhappy with the attention that JON is getting instead of her.

32281,"CUT TO: The main hall, later."
32282,"NARRATOR:TORMUND, confessional and teary, pours his heart out to the HOUND.  TORMUND; And after all that, this fucker comes north and takes her from me. sJust takes her, like that. I mean it, Clegane. My heart is broken."

32286,NARRATOR:TORMUND swivels quickly to find WILLA and SARRA standing nearby.
32287,WILLA: I'm not afraid of wildlings.
32288,TORMUND: Maybe you should be.
32289,NARRATOR:SANSA watches their interaction from afar. TORMUND chuckles and hugs WILLA close to him
32290,"TORMUND: Well, Clegane it's time to drown our sorrows."

32307,NARRATOR:SANSA returns his brush off with silence.

32310,"HOUND: Yes, I've heard. Heard you were broken in. Heard you were broken in rough."

32318,"NARRATOR:SANSA clasps his hand, gently. He looks down at the kindness, then back at her eyes."
32319,"SANSA: Without Littlefinger, and Ramsay and the rest, I would have stayed a Little Bird all my life."
32320,"NARRATOR:SANSA gathers herself, stands and exits. The HOUND ponders."
32321,EXT: Winterfell courtyard.
32322,"NARRATOR:The rowdiness continues to increase, as the party spills out into the courtyard"

32327,NARRATOR:ARYA notches another bow.
32328,"GENDRY: It's nighttime, it's freezing, and everyone's celebrating. You should be celebrating with them."

32332,ARYA: Congratulations.
32333,NARRATOR:GENDRY grabs her quickly and kisses her.
32334,"GENDRY: I don't know how to be lord of anything. I hardly know how to use a fork. All I know is that you're beautiful, and I love you, and none of it will be worth anything if you're not with me. So be with me."

32356,JAIME: That's very diligent. Very responsible.
32357,BRIENNE:  Piss off.
32358,JAIME:  You know the first thing I learned in the North? I hate the fucking North.
32359,BRIENNE: It grows on you.
32360,JAIME: I don't want things growing on me.
32361,NARRATOR:JAIME fills the other glass with a sloppy pour.
32362,JAIME: How about Tormund Giantsbane? Has he grown on you? He was very sad when you left.

32364,BRIENNE:  (almost whispering) You sound quite jealous.
32365,"JAIME:  (nods) I do, don't I? It's bloody hot in here."
32366,NARRATOR:JAIME works to undo the lacing of his shirt. It is not easy to do it one-handed. He chuckles in embarrassment at his ineptitude. He tries using his left hand and his teeth. BRIENNE realizes that this is a drunken seduction. She swats his hand away.

32380,NARRATOR:JON looks at her for a beat.
32381,JON: No.
32382,NARRATOR:JON stands and stumbles a bit. He laughs at himself.
32383,JON: Only a little.
32384,NARRATOR:DAENERYS shuts the door and moves closer.
32385,"JON: I didn't know Ser Jorah well but I know this. If he could have chosen a way to die, it would have been protecting you."

32387,NARRATOR:They embrace.

32391,NARRATOR:She sits.
32392,"DAENERYS: I try to forget. Tonight I did for a while, and then I saw them gathered around you. I saw the way they looked at you. I know that look. So many people have looked at me that way, but never here. Never on this side of the sea."
32393,JON: I told you I don't want it.
32394,"DAENERYS: (angrily) It doesn't matter what you want. You didn't want to be King in the North. What happens when they demand you press your claim, and take what is mine?"
32395,NARRATOR:JON kneels before her.
32396,JON: I'll refuse. You are my queen. I don't know what else I can say.
32397,NARRATOR:DAENERYS quickly takes JON's face in her hands and looks him straight in the eye.
32398,"DAENERYS: (desperately)You can say nothing. To anyone, ever. Never tell them who you really are. Swear your brother and Samwell Tarly to secrecy, and tell no one else. Or it will take on a life of its own and you won't be able to control it or what it does to people. No matter how many times you bend the knee, no matter what you swear."
32399,NARRATOR:JON stands. DAENERYS takes his hand in hers.
32400,DAENERYS: I want it to be the way it was between us.
32401,NARRATOR:JON returns her touch.
32402,JON: I have to tell Sansa and Arya.
32403,DAENERYS: Sansa will want to see me gone and you on the Iron Throne.
32404,JON: She won't.
32405,"DAENERYS: She's not the girl you grew up with. Not after what she's seen, not after what they've done to her."
32406,JON: I owe them the truth.
32407,DAENERYS: Even if the truth destroys us?
32408,JON: It won't.
32409,DAENERYS: It will. I've never begged for anything but I'm begging you. Don't do this. Please.
32410,NARRATOR:JON cups her face in his hands.
32411,JON: You are my queen. Nothing will change that. And they are my family. We can live together.
32412,DAENERYS: We can. I've just told you how.
32413,NARRATOR:JON lets his hands fall. DAENERYS walks away.
32414,"INT: BRIENNE's chambers, night"

32416,"INT: WInterfell war room, day."
32417,"NARRATOR:The room contains a map of Westeros with stone pieces representing the forces at Winterfell and King's Landing. The war council consists of MISSANDEI, DAENERYS, VARYS, GREY WORM, TYRION, JON, ARYA, SANSA, QHONO, SAM, BRAN, MAESTER WOLKAN, DAVOS and BRIENNE. The mood is somber and tense."
32418,NARRATOR:GREY WORM picks up a handful of Winterfell markers.
32419,GREY WORM:  Half are gone.
32420,JON: The Northmen as well.
32421,NARRATOR:JON slides of some other markers. MAESTER WOLKAN slides away some more. VARYS places additional markers in King's Landing.
32422,"VARYS: And the Golden Company has arrived in King's Landing, courtesy of the Greyjoy fleet. The balance has grown distressingly even."
32423,"MISSANDEI: When the people find out what we have done for them, that we saved them--"
32424,DAENERYS: Cersei will make sure they don't believe it. We will hit her hard. We will rip her out root and stem.
32425,TYRION: The objective here is to remove Cersei without destroying King's Landing.
32426,"VARYS: Thankfully, she's losing allies by the day. Yara Greyjoy has retaken the Iron Islands in her queen's name. The new Prince of Dorne pledges his support."
32427,"DAENERYS: No matter how many lords turn against her, as long as she sits on the Iron Throne, she can call herself Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. We need the capital."
32428,"TYRION: I watched the people of King's Landing rebel against their king when they were hungry, and that was before winter began. Give them the opportunity and they will cast Cersei aside."
32429,"JON: We'll surround the city. If the Iron Fleet tries to ferry in more food, the dragons will destroy them. If the Lannisters and the Golden Company attack, we'll defeat them in the field."
32430,"TYRION: Once the people see that Cersei is our only enemy, her reign is over."
32431,NARRATOR:DAENERYS thinks before responding.
32432,DAENERYS: All right.
32433,SANSA: The men we have left are exhausted. Many of them are wounded. They'll fight better if they have time to rest and recuperate.
32434,DAENERYS: How long do you suggest?
32435,"SANSA: I can't say for certain, not without talking to the officers."
32436,"DAENERYS: I came north to fight alongside you at great cost to my armies and myself. Now that the time has come to reciprocate, you want to postpone."
32437,SANSA: It's not just our people. It's yours. You want to throw them into a war they're not ready to fight?
32438,"DAENERYS:THE longer I leave my enemies alone, the stronger they become."
32439,JON: (to SANSA and ARYA) The Northern forces will honor their promises and their allegiance to the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.
32440,NARRATOR:JON turns to face DAENERYS
32441,"JON: What you command, we will obey."
32442,NARRATOR:ARYA and SANSA exchange a glance.
32443,TYRION: So if all are in agreement Jon and Ser Davos will ride down the Kingsroad with the Northern troops and the bulk of the remaining Dothraki and Unsullied.
32444,NARRATOR:JON moves the corresponding markers on the map.
32445,"TYRION: A smaller group of us will ride to White Harbor, and sail from there to Dragonstone with our queen and her dragons accompanying us from above."
32446,NARRATOR:GREY WORM moves those markers into position.
32447,"TYRION: Ser Jaime has chosen to remain here, as a guest of the Lady of Winterfell."
32448,"DAENERYS: We have won the Great War. Now we will win the Last War. In all Seven Kingdoms, men will live without fear and cruelty under their rightful queen."
32449,"NARRATOR:Everyone exits, except for the Stark children. ARYA intercepts JON as he begins to leave. SANSA moves to stand beside BRAN."
32450,ARYA: We need a word.
32451,"EXT: Winterfell godswood, day"
32452,NARRATOR:The Stark children discuss the situation in the godswood.
32453,JON: You understand we'd all be dead if not for her. We'd be corpses marching down to King's Landing.
32454,SANSA: Arya's the one that killed the Night King.
32455,JON: Her men gave their lives defending Winterfell--
32456,SANSA: And we will never forget them. That doesn't mean that I want to kneel to someone who--
32457,JON: I swore myself and the North to her cause.
32458,ARYA: I respect that.
32459,SANSA: You respect it?
32460,"ARYA: We needed her. We needed her army, her dragons. You did the right thing. And we're doing the right thing telling you we don't trust your queen."
32461,JON:  You don't know her yet.
32462,ARYA:  I'll never know her. She's not one of us.
32463,"JON: If you only trust the people you grew up with, you won't make many allies."
32464,ARYA: That's all right. I don't need many allies.
32465,JON: Arya -
32466,ARYA: We're family. The four of us. The last of the Starks.
32467,JON: I've never been a Stark.
32468,SANSA: You are. You're just as much Ned Stark's child as any of us.
32469,ARYA: You're my brother. Not my half-brother or my bastard brother. My brother.
32470,NARRATOR:JON hesitates.
32471,BRAN: It's your choice.
32472,"NARRATOR:SANSA and ARYA look to BRAN, confused."
32473,JON: I need to tell you something. But you have to swear you'll never tell another soul.
32474,ARYA: What is it?
32475,"JON: You have to swear it, before I tell you."
32476,SANSA: How can I promise to keep a secret if I don't even know what it is?
32477,JON: Because we're family. Swear it.
32478,ARYA: I swear it.
32479,SANSA: I swear it.
32480,JON: (to BRAN) Tell them.
32481,NARRATOR:SANSA and ARYA turn to BRAN.

32487,"JAIME: She's sworn to protect the Stark girls, so... Say something snide."
32488,TYRION: I'm happy. I'm happy that you're happy. I'm happy that you'll finally have to climb for it.
32489,NARRATOR:They both laugh
32490,TYRION: Do you know how long I've waited to tell tall-person jokes? To climbing mountains.
32491,NARRATOR:TYRION and JAIME clink their glasses in a toast.
32492,JAIME: To climbing mountains.
32493,NARRATOR:They drink.
32494,TYRION: What's she like down there?
32495,JAIME: What? That's not your concern.
32496,TYRION: I haven't been with a woman for years. Give me a morsel.
32497,JAIME: You're a dog.
32498,"TYRION: I am the Imp, and I demand to know."
32499,NARRATOR:BRONN enters. He cavalierly holds JOFFREY's crossbow
32500,"BRONN: I knew you were fucking her. A pair of tall, blond toffs. Must be like looking in the mirror."
32501,NARRATOR:JAIME motions to the crossbow.
32502,JAIME: What are you doing with that?
32503,"BRONN: Oh, this? This is for you. For both of you."
32504,TYRION: You're supposed to be south.
32505,NARRATOR:BRONN sits next to them.
32506,BRONN: You boys are a pair of gold-plated cunts. Do you know that?
32507,TYRION: That's a bit rude.
32508,"TYRION: You're a knight, thanks to me."
32509,BRONN: Thanks to me. And that title's worth as much as a blond hair from your brother's ballsack.
32510,JAIME: Power resides where men believe--
32511,BRONN: Shut your mouth.
32512,TYRION: I'm just trying--
32513,"BRONN: I've never hit a dwarf before, but say another word and I will belt you."
32514,"TYRION: See, I don't believe you'd do that, after all--"
32515,"NARRATOR:BRONN pivots in his seat and gives TYRION a left hook to the face. JAIME jerks to his feet. In a fluid motion, BRONN leans back and threatens JAIME with the crossbow"
32516,"BRONN: You couldn't do it on your best day, you one-handed fuck. And your best days are long gone."
32517,"NARRATOR:TYRION tips his head back and groans, holding his nose with both hands."
32518,TYRION: You broke my nose!
32519,BRONN: I did not break your nose.
32520,TYRION: How do you know?
32521,"BRONN: Because I've been breaking noses since I was your size, and I know what it sounds like. Now listen. Your sister offered me Riverrun. Nice big castle, good lands, plenty of peasants who do what they're told."
32522,JAIME:  And you trust Cersei--
32523,"BRONN: I knew your sister was dead the second I saw those dragons. Now, your army may be torn to shit, but I'd still bet on your Dragon Queen to win. And it just so happens I'm a betting man. If Cersei's dead, she can't pay up."
32524,NARRATOR:BRONN picks up a cup of wine and drinks deeply.
32525,"BRONN: Mmm, that's good. Of course, the odds change if the Dragon Queen's Hand turns up dead. Maybe a few of her top generals get picked off one by one. All of a sudden -"
32526,TYRION: May I speak?
32527,BRONN: Why not? Only death will shut you up.
32528,TYRION: We made a deal long ago. Do you remember?
32529,"BRONN: If anyone offered me money to kill you, you'd pay me double. What's double Riverrun?"
32530,TYRION: Highgarden. You could be Lord of the Reach.
32531,JAIME: Highgarden? Are you mad?
32532,TYRION: It's better than being dead.
32533,JAIME: He's not going to kill us. He wouldn't be talking to us if--
32534,"NARRATOR:BRONN unleashes a crossbow bolt just past JAIME's head. They both are taken by surprise, and go silent at the threat. BRONN reloads."
32535,"BRONN: The way I see it, I only need one of the Lannister brothers alive."
32536,JAIME: Highgarden will never belong to a cutthroat.
32537,"BRONN: No? Who were your ancestors, the ones who made your family rich? Fancy lads in silk? They were fucking cutthroats. That's how all the great houses started, isn't it? With a hard bastard who was good at killing people. Kill a few hundred people, they make you a lord. Kill a few thousand, they make you king. And then all your cocksucking grandsons can ruin the family with their cocksucking ways."
32538,NARRATOR:BRONN takes another drink
32539,BRONN: Highgarden. Give me your word.
32540,"TYRION: You have my word. None of this means a thing until we take King's Landing. We ride south in the morning. We could use an officer with knowledge of the city's defenses.  BRONN; (chuckles)  Oh, no. No, my fighting days are done. But I still got a few killing days left, you hear me? I'll come find you when the war is done. Till then, don't die."
32541,"NARRATOR:BRONN stands up and backs out of the room, keeping the crossbow trained on the the Lannisters. He shuts the door behind him. JAIME and TYRION look to one another."
32542,"EXT: Outside of Winterfell, day."
32543,"NARRATOR:The HOUND rides though the gray and snowy landscape, chewing on some jerky. He sees something in the distance."
32544,HOUND: For fuck's sake.
32545,"NARRATOR:ARYA rides up next to him. Annoyed, the HOUND throws his jerky on the ground ."
32546,ARAY: On your own?
32547,NARRATOR:They ride side by side.
32548,HOUND: Not anymore. I don't like crowds.
32549,ARYA: Me neither.
32550,HOUND: Why not? They all love you now. You're the big hero.
32551,ARYA: Don't like heroes.
32552,HOUND: It must have felt good sticking a knife in that horned fucker.
32553,ARYA: Felt better than dying. You're heading to King's Landing?
32554,HOUND: I have some unfinished business.
32555,ARYA: Me too.
32556,HOUND: I don't plan on coming back.
32557,ARYA: Neither do I.
32558,HOUND: Gonna leave me to die again if I get hurt?
32559,ARYA:  Probably.
32560,NARRATOR:The HOUND laughs. ARYA smiles.
32561,EXT: Hills outside Winterfell.

32564,NARRATOR:SANSA watches the dragons soar through the air. TYRION approaches.
32565,TYRION:  My lady.
32566,"NARRATOR:Distracted by the flying dragons, SANSA does not answer."
32567,"TYRION: ""My lord"" is the standard response."
32568,SANSA: Why her?
32569,TYRION: You know she loves your brother.
32570,SANSA: That doesn't mean she'll be a good queen.
32571,"TYRION: You seem determined to dislike her. A good relationship between the Iron Throne and the North has been the core of every peaceful, prosperous reign we've ever known."
32572,"SANSA: Jon will be Warden of the North, so a good relationship seems likely."
32573,TYRION: I don't expect him to spend much time here going forward.
32574,"SANSA: Well, I suppose that's up to him."
32575,"TYRION: Sansa, look at me."
32576,NARRATOR:SANSA takes her eyes off the dragons and slowly turns to look at TYRION.
32577,"TYRION:  With Jon in the capital, you'll be the true power in the North. I'd feel much better about the future if I left here today believing that you and Daenerys were allies."
32578,SANSA: What are you worried about? Jon's taking our army with him. Your queen still has her dragons--
32579,TYRION: She's your queen too.
32580,NARRATOR:The Unsullied march in time out the main gate of Winterfell. SANSA and TYRION both turn to watch.
32581,SANSA: You're afraid of her.
32582,TYRION: Every good ruler needs to inspire a bit of fear.
32583,SANSA: I don't want Jon to go down there. The men in my family don't do well in the capital.
32584,"TYRION: No, but as your brother once told me, he's not a Stark."
32585,NARRATOR:SANSA gives an exasperated sigh and turns away.
32586,TYRION: Are you all right?
32587,NARRATOR:SANSA mulls the information she knows about JON's heritage.
32588,"TYRION: Her people love her, you've seen that. You've seen how they fight for her. She wants to make the world a better place. I believe in her."
32589,NARRATOR:TYRION starts to walk away.
32590,SANSA: Tyrion. What if there's someone else? Someone better?
32591,EXT: Winterfell courtyard.
32592,NARRATOR:DAVOS mounts his steed while JON packs his saddle. TORMUND approachs.
32593,TORMUND: You're not gonna ride the dragon south?
32594,"NARRATOR:JON shakes is head, amused by the jibe. He walks to meet TORMUND half way."
32595,JON: Just a horse. Rhaegal needs to heal. He doesn't need me weighing him down.
32596,TORMUND: (scoffs). You weigh as much as two fleas fucking.
32597,JON: (laughs)
32598,TORMUND: I'm taking the Free Folk home. We've had enough of the south. The women down here don't like me.
32599,"JON: This is the North, you know. And the Free Folk are welcome to stay."
32600,TORMUND: It isn't home. We need room to wander. I'll take them back through Castle Black as soon as the winter storms pass. Back where we belong.
32601,NARRATOR:JON looks at Ghost.
32602,JON: It's where he belongs too. A direwolf has no place in the south. Will you take him with you? He'll be happier up there.
32603,TORMUND: So would you.
32604,"JON: I wish I was going with you. This is farewell, then."
32605,TORMUND: You never know.
32606,NARRATOR:TORMUND and JON hug.
32607,TORMUND: You've got the North in you. The real North.
32608,"NARRATOR:TORMUND exits. JON walks to meet SAM and GILLY. JON gives GILLY a hug, and is surprised by her baby bump. She looks at her belly, smiling. SAM nods to confirm that she is pregnant."
32609,"SAM: Yes, well, the nights have been getting longer and there wasn't that much to do in Oldtown. There's only so many books a person can read, so we--"
32610,"GILLY: I'm sure he knows how it happens, Sam. If it's a boy, we want to name him Jon."
32611,JON: I hope it's a girl.
32612,"NARRATOR:JON and SAM hug, both of them holding back tears."
32613,SAM: You're the best friend I ever had.
32614,"JON: You too, Sam."
32615,"NARRATOR:JON walks away. Ghost whines as he passes. JON mounts, and rides out of the gate with DAVOS. TORMUND, Ghost, SAM and GILLY watch him go."
32616,EXT: The open sea
32617,NARRATOR:The Targaryen fleet cuts sails at a fine clip. GREY WORM and MISSANDEI stand together on deck. MISSANDEI discreetly clasps GREY WORM's hand. He looks down at their hands and the smile at one another.
32618,INT: The captain's quarters
32619,"NARRATOR:TYRION sits, talking with VARYS, who stands nearby."
32620,"TYRION: Think of the past 20 years. The war, the murder, the misery. All of it because Robert Baratheon loved someone who didn't love him back."
32621,VARYS: How many others know?
32622,NARRATOR:VARYS sits.
32623,TYRION: Including us? Eight.
32624,"VARYS: Well, then it's not a secret anymore. It's information. If a handful of people know now, hundreds will know soon. Then what happens?"
32625,"TYRION: She loses the North. She loses the Vale, Sansa will make sure of that."
32626,"VARYS: No, it's worse than that. He has the better claim to the throne."
32627,TYRION: He doesn't want the throne.
32628,NARRATOR:TYRION begins to pace.
32629,"VARYS: I'm not sure it matters what he wants. The fact is, people are drawn to him. Wildlings, Northmen. He's a war hero."
32630,"TYRION: He loves our queen. And she loves him. If we marry them, they could rule together."
32631,VARYS: She's his aunt.
32632,TYRION: That never stopped a Targaryen before.
32633,"VARYS: No, but Jon grew up in Winterfell. Is marrying your aunt common in the North? You know our queen better than I do. Do you think she wants to share the throne? She does not like to have her authority questioned."
32634,TYRION:  Something she has in common with every monarch who ever lived.
32635,VARYS: I worry about her state of mind.
32636,TYRION: We are advisors to the queen. Worrying about her state of mind is our job. We still have to take King's Landing. Maybe Cersei will win and kill us all. That would solve our problems.
32637,EXT: Dragonstone harbor.
32638,"NARRATOR:A ship drops anchor, and another furls its sails.  Others in the distance have already set anchor. Rhaegal and Drogon fly overhead, with DAENERYS riding. They soar over the castle, enjoying themselves. Suddenly, a huge bolt pierces Rhaegal's chest. He screeches in pain. DAENERYS is baffled and distraught. Rhaegal struggles to continue flying. Another bolt plunges into his chest, and a third pierces his neck. Blood spurts and the mighty dragon tumbles towards the sea."
32639,CUT TO: The Targaryen fleet.
32640,"NARRATOR:TYRION and VARYS race to the deck, in time to see Rhaegal plunge into the sea just off the side of their ship, upside down and unconscious. Men shout in confusion and race around the deck. Rhaegel disappears below the foamy splash."
32641,CUT TO: The sky overhead.
32642,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS looks down in horror. Another giant bolt zooms just above her head. She ducks in surprise, and looks up to see the Ironborn fleet appear from behind the craggy shores of Blackwater. Scorpions have been mounted on their foredecks. EURON himself mans one of the scorpions. His crew repositions the huge siege weapon for another shot. Rage takes over DAENERYS as she guides Drogon to dive towards the Ironborn. She screams a war cry. EURON patiently waits for his shot. The Ironborn let loose a volley of bolts, forcing DAENERYS to veer away from her attack dive. Drogon escapes unscathed, tailed by bolts as he retreats. DAENERYS reels and seeths."

32654,NARRATOR:MISSANDEI retreats.
32655,"NARRATOR:TYRION takes stock of the attacking Ironborn ships, coming towards them at full sail."
32656,SOLDIER 1: Spears!
32657,SOLDIER 2: They're coming round again!
32658,CUT TO: The Ironborn fleet
32659,"NARRATOR:EURON takes aim with a menacing smile. He lets loose the bolt with a grunt. The other ships follow suit, sending off a brutal assault"
32660,CUT TO: The Targaryen fleet
32661,NARRATOR:The volley of giant bolts takes apart the Targaryen ships. GREY WORM is knocked off his feet by the devastating force of impact.
32662,SOLDIER 3: Go!
32663,SOLDIER 4: Clear!
32664,SOLDIER 5: Man your stations!
32665,MISSANDEI: No!
32666,"NARRATOR:The sea spurts over the railings as the massive bolts destroy the hull. TYRION pivots away from the attacking side and is nearly impaled  on a whistling bolt. He falls backwards with a grunt. He quickly swivels back to his feet and changes direction. Another mighty bolt screams through the air in front of him, and destroys the railing on the far side of the deck. TYRION tries to continue towards the stern of the ship, but the dangerous bolts continue relentlessly, causing devastation and carnage. With no other options, TYRION jumps overboard to escape."
32667,SOLDIER 4: Go! Go!
32668,SOLDIER 5: Clear!
32669,NARRATOR:TYRION treads water. He looks up as a felled mast comes down on top of him. The screen goes black.
32670,EXT: The shore of Blackwater Bay.
32671,"NARRATOR:Unsullied drag their comrades through the surf and onto the shore. They cough and gasp. VARYS and TYRION lie on the shore, VARYS coughing uncontrollably. TYRION pants. GREY WORM staggers to the shore and desperately looks around."
32672,GREY WORM:  Missandei? Missandei!
32673,"NARRATOR:GREY WORM runs back into the water, his eyes scanning for his love."
32674,GREY WORM: Missandei!
32675,NARRATOR:He dives into the water and swims out to search for her.
32676,"INT: King's Landing, the Red Keep"
32677,NARRATOR:CERSEI looks out into the courtyard of the Red Keep. A crowd files in through the main entrance from the city beyond.
32678,"CERSEI: Our message was well-received, then?"
32679,QYBURN: Your people have heard the Usurper is coming. They are grateful for your protection within the walls of the Red Keep.
32680,NARRATOR:EURON approaches.
32681,CERSEI: You're certain about the dragon?
32682,EURION: I saw it sink beneath the waves.
32683,CERSEI: That must have been glorious.
32684,NARRATOR:EURON kneels before her.
32685,"EURON: The glory is yours, my queen."
32686,NARRATOR:CERSEI strokes his face.
32687,"CERSEI: When the war is won, the Lion shall rule the land, the Kraken shall rule the sea and our child shall one day rule them all."
32688,"NARRATOR:EURON rises, and looks to QYBURN, who nods, confirming CERSEI's pregnancy. Elated, EURON stokes CERSEI affectionately. She does not enjoy it."
32689,EURON: She's coming for you.
32690,"CERSEI: Of course she is. Keep the gates open. If she wants to take the castle, she'll have to murder thousands of innocent people first."
32691,"NARRATOR:CERSEI moves away from the window and walks past the MOUNTAIN, who guards MISSANDEI, hands shackled and weeping."
32692,"CERSEI: So much for ""the Breaker of Chains."""
32693,"NARRATOR:CERSEI, QYBURN and EURON exit."
32694,INT: Dragonstone War Room
32695,NARRATOR:DAENERYS lays down the lion figure on the war map.
32696,"GREY WORM: We will storm the city, my queen. We will kill your enemies. All of them."
32697,VARYS: Your Grace. I promised you I would look you in the eye and speak directly if I ever thought you were making a mistake. This is a mistake.
32698,DAENERYS: You saw my child fall from the sky.
32699,VARYS: (nods)
32700,DAENERYS: They took Missandei.
32701,"VARYS: Cersei needs to be destroyed, but if we attack King's Landing with Drogon and the Unsullied and the Dothraki, tens of thousands of innocents will die. That is why Cersei is bringing them into the Red Keep. These are the people you came here to protect. I beg you, Your Grace. Do not destroy the city you came to save. Do not become what you have always struggled to defeat."
32702,"DAENERYS: Do you believe we're here for a reason, Lord Varys? I'm here to free the world from tyrants. That is my destiny and I will serve it, no matter the cost."
32703,NARRATOR:VARYS is silent.
32704,"TYRION: It could be a fortnight before Jon and the allied armies make it to King's Landing. In the meantime, demand Cersei surrender. Offer her her life in exchange for the throne. If there's a chance to avoid the coming slaughter, we should make the effort."
32705,"DAENERYS: Speaking to Cersei will not prevent a slaughter. But perhaps it's good the people see that Daenerys Stormborn made every effort to avoid bloodshed, and Cersei Lannister refused. They should know whom to blame when the sky falls down upon them."
32706,NARRATOR:DAENERYS and GREY WORM exit.
32707,INT: Dragonstone Throne Room
32708,VARYS:  I've served tyrants most of my life. They all talk about destiny.
32709,TYRION: She's a girl who walked into a fire with three stones and walked out with three dragons. How could she not believe in destiny?
32710,VARYS: Perhaps that's the problem. Her life has convinced her that she was sent here to save us all.
32711,TYRION: And how do you know she wasn't?
32712,"VARYS: Then there's the problem of Jon Snow. Perhaps it's actually a solution. You know them both. Tell me, who do you think would make a better ruler?"
32713,NARRATOR:TYRION pours himself some wine.
32714,TYRION: He doesn't want the throne. That's why he bent the knee.
32715,VARYS: Have you considered the best ruler might be someone who doesn't want to rule?
32716,TYRION: We're discussing treason.
32717,VARYS: Don't pretend you haven't thought about it.
32718,TYRION: Of course I've thought about it. Thoughts aren't treason.
32719,"VARYS: He's temperate and measured. He's a man, which makes him more appealing to the lords of Westeros, whose support we are going to need."
32720,"TYRION: Joffrey was a man. I don't think a cock is a true qualification, as I'm sure you'd agree."
32721,"VARYS: And he's the heir to the throne. Yes, because he's a man. Cocks are important, I'm afraid."
32722,TYRION: What about my earlier proposal? They could rule together as king and queen.
32723,"VARYS: She's too strong for him. She'd bend him to her will, as she already has."
32724,TYRION: He could temper her worst impulses.
32725,VARYS: As you have? You're drinking quite a lot. A Targaryen father and a Stark mother. Jon's the one man alive who might actually be able to keep the North in the Seven Kingdoms.
32726,TYRION: How many kings and queens have you served? Five? Six? I've lost count.
32727,VARYS: You've always known my reasons.
32728,"TYRION:  At a certain point, you choose a person you believe in, and you fight for that person."
32729,VARYS: Even if you know it's a mistake?
32730,TYRION: I believe in our queen. She'll make the right choice. With the help of her loyal advisors.
32731,VARYS: You know where my loyalty stands. You know I will never betray the realm.
32732,"TYRION: What is the realm? A vast continent, home to millions of people, most of whom don't care who sits on the Iron Throne."
32733,"VARYS: Millions of people, many of whom will die if the wrong person sits on that throne. We don't know their names, but they're just as real as you and I. They deserve to live. They deserve food for their children. I will act in their interest, no matter the personal cost."
32734,"TYRION: So, what happens to her?"
32735,"NARRATOR:VARYS looks at TYRION with a knowing lock, not putting words to the unspeakable. TYRION shakes his head."
32736,TYRION:  Please. Don't.
32737,VARYS: I've spoken as honestly as I can. Each of us has a choice to make. I pray we choose wisely.
32738,NARRATOR:VARYS exits.

32740,"A man breaks coal in the busy courtyard.  MAN 1: I'm just about to start it.  WOMAN 1: Good luck.  MAN 2: Protect shell right up to the wall.  MAN 1: All right, I'll put another one on it.   MAN 3: He's headed down to the cellar. I'll need a cart over here.  MAN 4: That's it, thanks. Thank you."
32741,"JAIME enters the courtyard. He looks over at SANSA, BRIENNE and MAESTER WOLKAN, who are engaged in conversation. WOLKAN exits one way and SANSA and BRIENNE leave in another. JAIME follows them.  WOMAN 2: It's really heavy, mind you.  MAN 5: We need some more water.  MAN 3: Take it down there!"

32745,NARRATOR:JAIME approaches them cautiously.
32746,JAIME: What happened?
32747,"NARRATOR:SANSA and BRIENNE exchange a glance. SANSA nods, giving BRIENNE permission to discuss it with JAIME."
32748,"BRIENNE: Euron Greyjoy ambushed Queen Daenerys and her fleet. One of the dragons was killed, several ships destroyed, Missandei captured."
32749,SANSA: I always wanted to be there when they execute your sister. Seems like I won't get the chance.
32750,NARRATOR:SANSA exits. JAIME's face falls.
32751,"INT: BRIENNE's chambers, night."

32754,NARRATOR:JAIME readies his horse for departure. BRIENNE approaches.
32755,BRIENNE: They're going to destroy that city. You know they will.
32756,JAIME: Have you ever run away from a fight?
32757,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE takes JAIME's face in her hands, entreating him."
32758,BRIENNE: You're not like your sister. You're not. You're better than she is. You're a good man and you can't save her. You don't need to die with her. Stay here. Stay with me. (voice breaking) Please. Stay.
32759,"JAIME: You think I'm a good man? I pushed a boy out a tower window, crippled him for life for Cersei. I strangled my cousin with my own hands just to get back to Cersei. I would have murdered every man, woman and child in Riverrun for Cersei."
32760,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE inhales deeply, holding back her tears."
32761,JAIME: She's hateful. And so am I.
32762,"NARRATOR:JAIME turns and mounts his horse. BRIENNE sobs. JAIME rides away, leaving her alone with her tears."
32763,"EXT: Outside King's Landing, day"
32764,"NARRATOR:VARYS, GREY WORM, DAENERYS and TYRION stand in front of the phalanx of Unsullied soldiers. High above them atop the gate, CERSEI, EURON and the MOUNTAIN look down upon them. MISSANDEI stands with them, bound and very scared. They are flanked by a long line of scorpions, loaded, manned and ready. The small company of Unsullied are vastly outnumbered by the archers and soldiers of King's Landing. An Unsullied solder shout and the company thump their spears to attention."
32765,NARRATOR:The gate rattles and QYBURN walks out. TYRION steps forward to meet him. They come together half way between the gate and the Unsullied.
32766,QYBURN: My lord.
32767,TYRION: Queen Daenerys demands Cersei's unconditional surrender and the immediate release of Missandei of Naath.
32768,"QYBURN: Queen Cersei demands Daenerys's unconditional surrender. If she refuses, Missandei of Naath will die here and now."
32769,"TYRION: Qyburn, you're a rational man."
32770,"QYBURN: Or so I flatter myself, my lord."
32771,"TYRION: We have a chance here, perhaps our last chance, to avoid carnage."
32772,QYBURN: Yes.
32773,TYRION: Help me. I don't want to see this city burn. I don't want to hear the screams of children burning alive.
32774,"QYBURN: No, it is not a pleasant sound."
32775,"QYBURN: My lord, I am only a mouthpiece for our queen."
32776,TYRION: Your queen.
32777,QYBURN: Cersei is Queen of the Seven Kingdoms. You are her subject.
32778,TYRION: Her reign is over. You understand this. Help her understand it.
32779,"QYBURN: We understand nothing of the sort. Your queen's last dragon is vulnerable. Your armies are battle-weary and depleted, while ours have been reinforced with the Golden Compan--"
32780,"NARRATOR:Having heard enough, TYRION walks past QYBURN so that he can address CERSEI directly. As he approaches the wall, The Kingsguard respond to the thread."
32781,CAPTAIN: Ready! Nock! Draw!
32782,"NARRATOR:The scores of archers draw their bows back, aiming at TYRION. The Imp continues to approach until he is within shouting distance. Looking down on him with contempt, CERSEI raises her hand, ready to give the order to her soldiers. She makes a fist and brings her arm gently to her side. Her men stand down. TYRION nods, gratefully."
32783,"TYRION:  I know you don't care about your people. Why should you? They hate you and you hate them. But you're not a monster. I know this. I know this because I've seen it. You've always loved your children. More than yourself, more than Jaime more than anything. I beg you. If not for yourself, then for your child. Your reign is over, but that doesn't mean your life has to end. It doesn't mean your baby has to die."
32784,"NARRATOR:CERSEI weights his words. DAENERYS looks on, both anxious and angry. CERSEI steps forward next to MISSANDEI. In response, DAENERYS and GREY WORM move closer."
32785,"CERSEI: (to MISSANEDEI) If you have any last words, now is the time."
32786,MISSANDEI: Dracarys.
32787,"NARRATOR:Horror and disbelief shows on the faces of DAENERYS and GREY WORM. TYRION mouths ""No"". CERSEI smiles cruelly. She looks to the MOUNTAIN, who steps forward, drawing his great sword. He sliced through MISSANDEI's neck in sweeping cut. Her head and body fall from the top of the gate to the ground below. GREY WORM turns away, unable to watch. His face twitches and be breathes raggedly."
32788,"NARRATOR:Atop the wall, CERSEI looks down, satisfied. EURON looks pleased. TYRION turns around, dejected. He looks at DAENERYS, who struggles to contain her anger. She turns and walk away, though the Unsullied soldiers. TYRION knows he has failed her. CERSEI savors her cruel moment. DAENERYS fumes and boils with fury as she walks away."

32793,EXT: The ruins of King's Landing
32794,"NARRATOR:TYRION walks silently through the smoldering desolation of King's Landing as soldiers mill in the distance. Everything is covered in filthy soot, and small fires continue to burn in the ruin. His eyes looks skyward as his memories replay. Flakes of ash drift in the air. He passes piles of brick and broken beams, and small fires speckle the devastation. He passes the prone body of a blond girl, the first of many charred and incinerated corpses. He does not pause."
32795,"NARRATOR:A man comes towards TYRION, shambling in a state of shock.  His bare chest is streaked with soot, and his pants are in tatters.  TYRION looks back as he passes. The whole of the man's back is burned away severely. TYRION continues forward, with JON and DAVOS trailing behind him. TYRION chokes down his rage as he walks. The bodies here have been reduced to skeletons, even those who were hiding indoors."
32796,"NARRATOR:TYRION, JON and DAVOS pause at mangled body of a Kingsguard."
32797,TYRION: I'll find you later.
32798,JON: It's not safe. Let me send some men with you.
32799,TYRION: I'm going alone.
32800,"NARRATOR:TYRION walks forward, alone. He turns a corner and pauses to take in the  Red Keep, and continues onward."
32801,EXT: The streets of King's Landing
32802,NARRATOR:Unsullied soldiers stand at attention behind a line of kneeling Kingsguard prisoners. GREY WORM paces in front of them.
32803,"GREY WORM:  In the name of the one true queen, Daenerys Targaryen, I sentence you to die."
32804,JON: Grey Worm!
32805,"NARRATOR:JON and DAVOS enter, along with their men. JON comes face-to-face with GREY WORM."
32806,JON: It's over.
32807,GREY WORM:  These men are prisoners. It is not over until the queen's enemies are defeated.
32808,DAVOS: How much more defeated do you want them to be? They're on their knees.
32809,GREY WORM:  They are breathing.
32810,"DAVOS: Look around you, friend. We won."
32811,"GREY WORM:  I obey my queen's commands, not yours."
32812,JON: And what are the queen's commands?
32813,"GREY WORM:  ""Kill all who follow Cersei Lannister."" These are free men. They chose to fight for her."
32814,"NARRATOR:GREY WORM draws his dagger, but JON grabs hold of his arm to stay him. As one, the Unsullied  lower their spears and step into battle stance. The Stark soldiers respond by drawing their weapons to defend their King."
32815,"DAVOS: Easy, men. Easy! Easy."
32816,NARRATOR:GREY WORM and JON continue to stare each other down.
32817,DAVOS: Jon. We should speak with the queen.
32818,"NARRATOR:The tension is broken, and JON looks down. Accepting DAVOS's council,  he releases GREY WORM's arm. They begin to walk away and the Unsullied return to attention. GREY WORM slits the throat of the first Kingsguard, The guard grunts softly as GREY WORM pushes him forward to die. JON and DAVOS exit."
32819,EXT: The Red Keep
32820,"NARRATOR:TYRION walks under the arcade leading to the map courtyard of the Red Keep. A great crack runs the length of the Westeros map, and piles of debris cover both sides of the broken floor. Ash flakes fall like snow. TYRION enters the chamber at the far side. He picks up a metal torch from the floor and continues further into the castle."
32821,INT: The Red Keep Cellar
32822,"NARRATOR:TYRION moves by torchlight down a circular stairway leading below the Keep. He reaches the bottom, and his eyes search the cavernous room.  Archways are filled with rubble, impassable. TYRION spies a crack of light in one archway. He places the torch on the ground."
32823,INT: The Dragon Skull Chamber
32824,"NARRATOR:TYRION enters the cellar chamber containing the dragon skulls. He climbs a pile of rubble and comes upon JAIME's golden hand, half buried amongst the bricks. TYRION kneels, then bows as he touches the hand in grief. As he straightens, he takes away a single heavy brick and tosses it aside. He moves a second brick and then a third. JAIME's body starts to become visible. TRYION begins to weep, painfully. He fights back the tears, and begins to work again. After a few bricks, his sobs overtake him. Still mostly buried corpses, JAIME lays holding CERSEI. TYRION bawls, and smashes a brick repeatedly in frustration. He props himself up to look at his siblings. He sobs again."
32825,EXT: Streets of King's Landing.
32826,"NARRATOR:ARYA walks through the streets, taking in the piles of debris and bodies. She is soot covered, he face bloody and filthy. Nearby, the Dothraki shout. She looks beyond the arches where the mounted Dothraki forces have amassed."
32827,"NARRATOR:Amongst the Dothraki, JON strides forward. They are still filled with battle lust, and their horses are antsy for action. After passing through the wild Dothraki, JON reaches the phalanx of disciplined Unsullied. He continues forward to a great staircase leading to a ruined structure. An expansive Targaryan flag hangs over the left side of the ruined facade."
32828,CUT TO: The adjacent arcade
32829,"NARRATOR:Further back, ARYA also walks forward, staying under the arcade to the left of the riled Dothraki."
32830,CUT TO: The steps
32831,"NARRATOR:JON reaches the foot of the staircase, lined by Unsullied on each side. He ascends towards GREY WORM above. A dragon roars in the distance. JON takes a deep breath as he looks up at GREY WORM at the top of the stairs. Drogon roars again. As the dragon files over the Dothraki, they cheer wildly. Drogon glides over the ruined facade. JON renews his ascent."
32832,"NARRATOR:JON reaches the top of the stairs. DAENERYS walks stoically from within the ruin of the building. Drogon roars and unfurls behind her. His wings appearing to expand from her soldiers, making her the image of a true dragon queen. Drogon then launches into the air. DAENERYS reaches the grand terrace, its staircase flanked by the disciplined Unsullied. She surveys the devastation of King's Landing, which continues to burn and smolder as far as the eye can see. JON walks to the wings as she takes her place in the center of the terrace, looking out over the ranks of the Unsullied, and the shouting Dothraki horde behind them. DAENERYS breathes deeply as she takes in her triumph, her destiny."
32833,CUT TO: The courtyard.
32834,NARRATOR:The Unsullied stand at rigid attention.  The controlled stillness of the Unsullied provides stark contrast to the wild Dothraoki ululations behind them.
32835,"NARRATOR:The Dothraki, still mounted continue to celebrate in their visceral fashion. They waive their raises swords and cheer wildly. Their horses churn amongst themselves, feeding on the energy of their riders."
32836,CUT TO: The terrace.
32837,DAENERYS: (in Dothraki) Blood of my blood.
32838,NARRATOR:The Dothraki horde quiets and looks up to their khaleesi.
32839,DAENERYS: You kept all your promises to me. You killed my enemies in their iron suits.
32840,NARRATOR:The Dothraki cheer.
32841,DAENERYS: Your tore down their stone houses. You gave me the Seven Kingdoms.
32842,"NARRATOR:Drogon lands on a ruined building to her left, and lets out a screeching roar. The Dothraki return the cheer, and resume their wild cries of celebration, waiving their weapons once again. From DAENERYS""s left, JON looks on with concern. DAENERYS surveys her forces with pride and satisfaction. She turns to speak to GREY WORM."
32843,DAENERYS: Torgo Nudho.
32844,NARRATOR:GREY WORM steps forward from her right.
32845,"DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) You have walked beside me since the Plaza of Pride. You are the bravest of men, the most loyal of soldiers. I name you commander of all my forces, the Queen's Master of War."
32846,"NARRATOR:The Unsullied thump their spears in a unison of slow triplets. GREY WORM steps back. From behind the terrace, TYRION approaches, his face a mask of malice."
32847,DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Unsullied. All of you were torn from your mother's arms and raised as slaves. Now you are liberators. You have freed the people of King's Landing from the grip of a tyrant!
32848,NARRATOR:The Unsullied thump their spears.
32849,DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) But the war is not over. We will not lay down our spears until we have liberated all the people of the world!
32850,"NARRATOR:The Unsullied thump their spears as DAENERYS continues her speech. JON and TYRION watch her, stone faced and roiling."
32851,"DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) From Winterfell to Dorne, from Lannisport to Qarth, from the Summer Isles to the Jade Sea! Women, men and children have suffered too long beneath the wheel."
32852,NARRATOR:Drogon roars and the Unsullied thump in threes.
32853,DAENERYS: (in Valyrian) Will you break the wheel with me?
32854,"NARRATOR:Drogon answers with a roar. The Unsullied  answer by thumping their spears rhythmically. Behind them, ARYA looks on with disgust."
32855,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS savors the moment. The Unsullied thump. Drogon roards. The Dothraki go wild, horses rearing."
32856,"NARRATOR:TYRION takes a deep breath, passes JON and approaches DAENERYS  cautiously from behind. He stands to her left to take in the scene. DAENERYS looks at him, satisfied. DROGON roars. The celebrations continue, spears thumping in rhythm and Dothraki screaming amok."
32857,DAENERYS: You freed your brother. You committed treason.
32858,TYRION: I freed my brother. And you slaughtered a city.
32859,"NARRATOR:They face one another. TYRION devastated and DAENERYS haughty. They lock eyes. TYRION removes his Queen's Hand brooch. He tosses it away in disgust. The brooch bounces half way down the steps, landing at the feet of an Unsullied warrior. The celebrations come to a quiet. DAENERYS and TYRION continue to take measure of one another. DAENERYS makes her decision."
32860,DAENERYS: (In Valyrian) Take him.
32861,"NARRATOR:Two Unsullied step forward and flank TYRION. The dwarf accepts his fate, turns his back to the courtyard, and walks slowly away. The Unsullied pivot and walks beside him. TYRION gives JON a look that demands that JON come to his own reckoning of DAENERYS's slaughter of King's Landing. JON's sorrowful visage is weighed by the gravity of the situation. He watches GREY WORM lead TYRION away. JON turns back to look at DAENERYS. She is both transcendent and horrible. She sees JON's inner conflict, and chooses to let him think. She walks away from the courtyard, her Unsullied falling in line behind her. JON watches her go."
32862,NARRATOR:JON steps into the courtyard behind the terrace and looks on as DAENERYS continues to walk on. He suddenly notices that ARYA has appeared silently at his side.
32863,JON: What are you doing here?
32864,"NARRATOR:Gathering himself, JON notices the cuts and wounds across ARYA's face. He takes hold of her."
32865,"JON: Hey, what happened?"
32866,ARYA: I came to kill Cersei. Your queen got there first.
32867,JON: (sighs) She's everyone's queen now.
32868,NARRATOR:They watch DAENERYS walk away with her Unsullied.
32869,ARYA: Try telling Sansa.
32870,JON: Wait for me outside the city gates. I'll come find you.
32871,"NARRATOR:JON starts to leave, but ARYA grabs his arm to halt him."
32872,ARYA: Jon. She knows who you are. Who you really are. You'll always be a threat to her. And I know a killer when I see one.
32873,INT: King's Landing Cellar
32874,"NARRATOR:JON descends a staircase, followed by an Unsullied warrior. He looks at the two Unsullied guards at the foot of the staircase, then hands Longclaw back to his minder. He strides past the Unsullied."
32875,INT: Tyrion's makeshift cell.
32876,"NARRATOR:An Unsullied warrior opens the door for JON, who walks past him into a large, darkened storeroom strewn with cabinets, tables, pots and crates.  The door shuts behind JON as he comes upon TYRION who sits on the floor, back against a small wooden pen."
32877,TYRION: Did you bring any wine?
32878,JON: No.
32879,"TYRION: Ah... Well... thank you for coming to see me. Our queen doesn't keep prisoners for long. I suppose there's a crude kind of justice. I betrayed my closest friend and watched him burn. Now Varys's ashes can tell my ASHES: ""See, I told you."" It just occurred to me. I'm talking to the only man alive who knows where I'm going."
32880,JON: (sighs)
32881,TYRION: So is there life after death?
32882,JON: Not that I've seen.
32883,TYRION: I should be thankful. Oblivion is the best I could hope for. I strangled my lover. I shot my own father with a crossbow. I betrayed my queen.
32884,JON: You didn't.
32885,"TYRION:  I did. And I'd do it again, now that I've seen what I've seen. I chose my fate. The people of King's Landing did not."
32886,JON: I can't justify what happened. I won't try. But the war is over now.
32887,"TYRION:  Is it? When you heard her talking to her soldiers, did she sound like someone who's done fighting?"
32888,NARRATOR:TYRION stands and approaches JON.
32889,TYRION: She liberated the people of Slaver's Bay. She liberated the people of King's Landing. And she'll go on liberating until the people of the world are free and she rules them all.
32890,"JON: And you've been by her side, counseling her. Until today."
32891,TYRION: Until today. Varys was right. I was wrong. It was vanity to think I could guide her. Our queen's nature is fire and blood.
32892,"JON: You think our house words are stamped on our bodies when we're born and that's who we are? Then I'd be fire and blood too. She's not her father, no more than you're Tywin Lannister."
32893,"TYRION: My father was an evil man. My sister was an evil woman. Pile up all the bodies of all the people they ever killed, there still won't be half as many as our beautiful queen slaughtered in a single day."
32894,JON: Cersei left her no choice.
32895,"TYRION: The moment the gates fell, the battle was over."
32896,JON: She saw her friend beheaded. She saw her dragon shot out of the sky.
32897,TYRION: And she burned down a city for it.
32898,"JON: Ah, it's easy to judge when you're standing far from the battlefield."
32899,TYRION: Would you have done it?
32900,JON: What?
32901,"TYRION: You've been up there, on a dragon's back. You've had that power. Would you have burned the city down?"
32902,JON: I don't know.
32903,"TYRION: (scoffs) Yes, you do. You won't say because you don't want to betray her but you know."
32904,JON: What's it matter what I'd do?
32905,"TYRION: It matters more than anything. When she murdered the slavers of Astapor, I'm sure no one but the slavers complained. After all, they were evil men."
32906,JON: (sighs)
32907,"TYRION: When she crucified hundreds of Meereenese nobles, who could argue? They were evil men. The Dothraki khals she burned alive? They would have done worse to her. Everywhere she goes, evil men die and we cheer her for it. And she grows more powerful and more sure that she is good and right. She believes her destiny is to build a better world for everyone. If you believed that if you truly believed it, wouldn't you kill whoever stood between you and paradise?"
32908,"NARRATOR:JON sits, overwhelmed, and inhales deeply. TYRION walks closer to him."
32909,TYRION: I know you love her. I love her too. Not as successfully as you. But I believed in her with all my heart. Love is more powerful than reason. We all know that. Look at my brother.
32910,"JON: ""Love is the death of duty."""
32911,TYRION: You just came up with that?
32912,JON: Maester Aemon said it a long time ago.
32913,"TYRION: Sometimes duty is the death of love. You are the shield that guards the realms of men. And you've always tried to do the right thing. No matter the cost, you've tried to protect people. Who is the greatest threat to the people now?"
32914,"NARRATOR:JON weighs TYRION's words, somber and distraught."
32915,TYRION: It's a terrible thing I'm asking. It's also the right thing. Do you think I'm the last man she'll execute? Who is more dangerous than the rightful heir to the Iron Throne?
32916,"NARRATOR:JON exhales shakily. Then he stands, regaining his composure."
32917,JON: That's her decision. She is the queen.
32918,"NARRATOR:JON pats TYRION's shoulder, and rests his hand there."
32919,JON: I'm sorry it came to this.
32920,NARRATOR:JON walks back to the door and knocks to call the guards.
32921,TYRION: And your sisters? Do you see them bending the knee?
32922,JON: My sisters will be loyal to the throne.
32923,TYRION:  Why do you think Sansa told me the truth about you? Because she doesn't want Dany to be queen.
32924,JON:  She doesn't get to choose.
32925,TYRION:  No. But you do. And you have to choose now.
32926,"NARRATOR:Keys rattle outside the door and it swings open. The guard stands at attention. JON ponders, then leaves quickly. The Unsullied guard shuts the door."
32927,EXT: King's Landing arcade.
32928,NARRATOR:JON strides the length of an arcade that is lined by Unsullied soldiers.
32929,EXT: King's Landing courtyard.
32930,"NARRATOR:JON walks in the snowy courtyard. The piles of rubble are covered by a layer of snow. More snow falls from the grey and blustery sky. He looks up at the Red Keep as he walks, approaching a passageway that leads to the Keep. As he approaches the passage, the large pile before him cracks, then undulates and expands. It is Drogon, wakened from slumber. The blanket of snow that enveloped him falls away. The dragon growls and extends himself to smell JON, who stands motionless before the great beast. Drogon growls softly, and curls back around himself, accepting JON's presence. JON walks past him and into the dark passage."
32931,INT: The Throne Room
32932,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS walks out of the darkness, into the half-demolished throne room. The Iron Throne sits untouched, surrounded by dust and snow. Open sky extends beyond it, where the wall of the Keep once stood. The wind blows and snow falls directly into the room. DAENERYS pauses, then walks to the throne, past the twisted and broken waste. She touches the hilt of one of the countless swords that have been forged into the throne. With a faint smile, DAENERYS takes in the enormity of the completion of her life's quest. She turns and looks back across the length of the hall."
32933,"NARRATOR:JON emerges from the same entryway that DAENERYS used. He walks towards her. She descends the steps to meet him, happy to share her victory with him."
32934,"DAENERYS: When I was a girl, my brother told me it was made with 1000 swords from Aegon's fallen enemies. What do 1000 swords look like in the mind of a little girl who can't count to 20? I imagined a mountain of swords too high to climb. So many fallen enemies, you could only see the soles of Aegon's feet."
32935,JON: I saw them executing Lannister prisoners in the street. They said they were acting on your orders.
32936,NARRATOR:DAENERYS takes on a defensive demeanor in response to JON's anger.
32937,DAENERYS: It was necessary.
32938,"JON:  Necessary? Have you been down there? Have you seen? Children, little children, burned!"
32939,DAENERYS: I tried to make peace with Cersei. She used their innocence as a weapon against me. She thought it would cripple me.
32940,JON: And Tyrion?
32941,"DAENERYS: He conspired behind my back with my enemies. How have you treated people who've done the same to you, even when it broke your heart?"
32942,JON: Forgive him.
32943,DAENERYS:  I can't.
32944,"JON: You can. You can forgive all of them, make them see they made a mistake. Make them understand."
32945,NARRATOR:DAENERYS does not respond.
32946,"JON: Please, Dany."
32947,DAENERYS: We can't hide behind small mercies. The world we need won't be built by men loyal to the world we have.
32948,JON: The world we need is a world of mercy. It has to be.
32949,"NARRATOR:DAENERYS comes closer, hopeful and bright."
32950,DAENERYS:  And it will be. It's not easy to see something that's never been before. A good world.
32951,JON: How do you know? How do you know it'll be good?
32952,DAENERYS:  Because I know what is good. And so do you.
32953,JON: I don't.
32954,DAENERYS:  You do. You do. You've always known.
32955,JON: What about everyone else? All the other people who think they know what's good.
32956,DAENERYS: They don't get to choose.
32957,NARRATOR:DAENERYS embraces JON.
32958,"DAENERYS: Be with me. Build the new world with me. This is our reason. It has been from the beginning, since you were a little boy with a bastard's name and I was a little girl who couldn't count to 20. We do it together. We break the wheel together."
32959,"JON: You are my queen. Now, and always."
32960,"NARRATOR:They kiss, passionately. JON's right arm thrusts as they kiss. He grunts as his blade pierces DAENERYS through the heart. Their lips part. Panting, DAENERYS looks down at the blade in her torso, then up into JON's eyes. They both pant and gasp. DAENERYS falls back, JON holding her up with both arms. Her eyes glaze in pain and disbelief. She takes shallow, panting breaths as small rivulets of blood run from her mouth and nose. She dies. JON exhales sharply and begins to weep."
32961,"NARRATOR:JON cradles her dead body. In the distance, DROGON screeches. The dragon past, then circles back to the throne room. Drogon roars and growls as he scrambles slowly towards JON and DAENERYS. He sniffs, confused and curious. JON tenderly lays DAENERYS down onto the snow-covered floor and continues his half-embrace as he takes her in."
32962,"NARRATOR:Behind him, Drogon, pushes forward, growling. JON stands and faces the dragon. He steps carefully back to make room. Drogon nuzzles DAENERYS and coos. When she doesn't move, he nuzzles more firmly with his chin. Recognizing she is dead, Drogon gives a short, piercing whistle, then looks directly at JON. A rumbling growl builds as Drogon bares his teeth at JON. He rears back, screeching and whistling, then turns to the sky for a deafening roar. He spreads his wings, balancing on his haunches, roaring and roaring. He brings his forearms down, and looks directly down at JON. He roars and his throat glows as the fire builds in his belly. JON prepares for his immolation."
32963,"NARRATOR:Drogon lets loose his inferno, extending his neck so that the flames surge past JON's head burn the castle walls around the Iron Throne. Drogon stops, takes a deep breath, then blasts the Iron Throne with an unyielding conflagration. The mighty throne slowly gives way as Drogon spews fire and roars. The sword tips melt and bend. The throne becomes a glowing, amorphous slag under the relentless flames. It spills and melts away in a molten, flaming heap."
32964,"NARRATOR:Drogon stops his assault. JON looks at the oozing, burning slag in amazement. Behind him, Drogon nuzzles DAENERYS again. Then the dragon grabs her gently in his hind claw. He takes to the sky, launching over the remains of the Iron Throne. He gives a final roar, and flies gently away."
32965,INT: Tyrion's Makeshift Cell.
32966,"NARRATOR:TYRION lies silently on the floor, eyes open, hands shackled. Footsteps approach and the door rattles open. GREY WORM enters, flanked by two Unsullied."
32967,EXT: An arcade
32968,"NARRATOR:TYRION walks with his hands chained. GREY WORM leads him to the Dragon Pit, with four unsullied marching behind them."
32969,NARRATOR:EXT; The Dragon Pit
32970,"NARRATOR:GREY WORM and TYRION reach the entrance to the Dragon Pit. The pass the Unsullied footmen who stand at attention. The large awning tent stands in the center of the pit, with many people seated underneath. GREY WORM and TYRION approach the central dais. Seated there are SAM, a RIVERLANDS LORD, and EDMURE, then ARYA, BRAN and SANSA,  then  BRIENNE, DAVOS, GENDRY and a VALE LORD, then an IRONBORN LORD, YARA and a DORNISH PRINCE and finally ROBIN ARRYN,  MAESTER WOLKAN and YOHN ROYCE. TYRION glowers at them, meets their eyes, and looks down in shame. GREY WORM stands with disciplined posture at his side."
32971,SANSA: Where's Jon?
32972,GREY WORM:  He is our prisoner.
32973,SANSA: So is Lord Tyrion. They were both to be brought to this gathering.
32974,GREY WORM:  We will decide what we do with our prisoners. This is our city now.
32975,"SANSA: If you look outside the walls of your city, you'll find thousands of Northmen who will explain to you why harming Jon Snow is not in your interest."
32976,GREY WORM:  And you will find thousands of Unsullied who believe that it is.
32977,YARA: Some of you may be quick to forgive. The Ironborn are not. I swore to follow Daenerys Targaryen.
32978,SANSA: You swore to follow a tyrant.
32979,"YARA: She freed us from a tyrant. Cersei is gone because of her, and Jon Snow put a knife in her heart. Let the Unsullied give him what he deserves."
32980,ARYA: Say another word about killing my brother and I'll cut your throat.
32981,NARRATOR:DAVOS stands.
32982,"DAVOS: Friends, please. We've been cutting each other's throats long enough. Torgo Nudho. Am I saying that properly?"
32983,NARRATOR:GREY WORM does not respond.
32984,"DAVOS: If it weren't for you and your men, we would've lost the war with the dead. This country owes you a debt it can never repay, but let us try. There is land in the Reach. Good land. The people that used to live there are gone. Make it your own. Start your own house with the Unsullied as your bannermen. We've had enough war. Thousands of you, thousands of them. You know how it ends. We need to find a better way."
32985,GREY WORM: We do not need payment. We need justice. Jon Snow cannot go free.
32986,NARRATOR:DAVOS sits.
32987,TYRION: It's not for you to decide.
32988,GREY WORM: You are not here to speak! Everyone has heard enough words from you.
32989,TYRION: (nods) You're right. And no one's any better for it. But it's not for you to decide. Jon committed his crime here. His fate is for our king to decide. Or our queen.
32990,MAESTER WOLKAN: We don't have a king or queen.
32991,TYRION: You're the most powerful people in Westeros. Choose one.
32992,"NARRATOR:TYRION looks at GREY WORM, who shakes his head dismissively."
32993,"GREY WORM: Make your choice, then."
32994,NARRATOR:Those on the dais exchange glances. EDMURE seizes the moment. He stands and moves towards the center of the dais.
32995,SANSA: Uncle? Please sit.
32996,"NARRATOR:EDMURE scoffs and looks around for support. He only finds muted laughter and averted gazes as he engages ROBIN, YOHN ROYCE, MAESTER WOLKAN and SAM. He turns to SANSA, whose eyes instruct him to take his seat. Humiliated, Edmure turns and stumbles as his sword crashes into the post at his side. He sits, then sighs."
32997,"MAESTER WOLKAN: Well, we have to choose someone."
32998,NARRATOR:SAM clears his throat to get everyone's attention.
32999,SAM: Why just us?
33000,NARRATOR:SAM stands.
33001,"NARRATOR:Those gather ponder SAM's suggestion. YOHN ROYCE bursts out laughing, and others follow."
33002,EDMURE: Maybe we should give the dogs a vote as well.
33003,YOHN ROYCE: I'll ask my horse.
33004,"NARRATOR:SAM nods uncomfortably at their rejection, then sits."
33005,EDMURE: I suppose you want the crown.
33006,"TYRION: Me? The Imp? Half the people hate me for serving Daenerys, the other half hate me for betraying her.  Can't think of a worse choice."
33007,"DAVOS:  Who, then?"
33008,TYRION: I've had nothing to do but think these past few weeks. About our bloody history. About the mistakes we've made.
33009,"NARRATOR:TYRION looks at GREY WORM, who rebuffs him."
33010,"TYRION: What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? Stories. There's nothing in the world more powerful than a good story. Nothing can stop it. No enemy can defeat it. And who has a better story than Bran the Broken? The boy who fell from a high tower and lived. He knew he'd never walk again, so he learned to fly. He crossed beyond the Wall, a crippled boy, and became the Three-Eyed Raven. He is our memory, the keeper of all our stories. The wars, weddings, births, massacres, famines. Our triumphs, mm, our defeats, our past. Who better to lead us into the future?"
33011,SANSA: Bran has no interest in ruling and he can't father children.
33012,"TYRION: Good. Sons of kings can be cruel and stupid, as you well know. His will never torment us. That is the wheel our queen wanted to break."
33013,"NARRATOR:TYRION looks at GREY WORM again. This time, he holds the Imp's gaze."
33014,"TYRION: From now on, rulers will not be born. They will be chosen on this spot by the lords and ladies of Westeros to serve the realm."
33015,NARRATOR:TYRION walks to BRAN.
33016,"TYRION: I know you don't want it. I know you don't care about power. But I ask you now, if we choose you will you wear the crown? Will you lead the Seven Kingdoms to the best of your abilities from this day until your last day?"
33017,BRAN: Why do you think I came all this way?
33018,TYRION: To Brandon of House Stark I say aye.
33019,NARRATOR:They consider
33020,SAM: Aye.
33021,NARRATOR:TYRION nods in return.
33022,EDMURE: Aye.
33023,RIVERLANDS LORD: Aye.
33024,YOHN ROYCE: Aye.
33025,"NARRATOR:TYRION turns to YOHN ROYCE, who nods in approval."
33026,MAESTER WOLKAN: Aye.
33027,ROBIN: Aye.
33028,DORNISH PRINCE: Aye.
33029,YARA: Aye.
33030,IRONBORN LORD: Aye.
33031,VALE LORD: Aye.
33032,GENDRY: Aye.
33033,"DAVOS: I'm not sure I get a vote, but aye."
33034,BRIENNE: Aye.
33035,NARRATOR:SANSA turns to BRAN.
33036,"SANSA: I love you, little brother. I always will. You'll be a good king. But tens of thousands of Northmen fell in the Great War defending all of Westeros. And those who survived have seen too much and fought too hard ever to kneel again. The North will remain an independent kingdom, as it was for thousands of years."
33037,"NARRATOR:BRAN nods, accepting SANSA's terms."
33038,"TYRION: All hail Bran the Broken, First of His Name, King of the Andals and the First Men, Lord of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm."
33039,NARRATOR:Everyone stands (except BRAN).
33040,ALL: All hail Bran the Broken!
33041,NARRATOR:They sit. TYRION bows to BRAN and turns to leave.
33042,BRAN: Lord Tyrion you will be my Hand.
33043,BRAN: And I don't want to be king.
33044,"TYRION: I don't deserve it. I thought I was wise, but I wasn't. I thought I knew what was right, but I didn't. Choose Ser Davos. Choose anyone else."
33045,BRAN:  I choose you.
33046,GREY WORM: You cannot.
33047,"BRAN: Yes, I can. I'm king."
33048,GREY WORM:   This man is a criminal. He deserves justice.
33049,BRAN: He just got it. He's made many terrible mistakes. He's going to spend the rest of his life fixing them.
33050,GREY WORM:  It is not enough.
33051,INT: JON's makeshift cell.
33052,NARRATOR:TYRION councils JON in his cell.
33053,TYRION: Giving you to the Unsullied would start a war. Letting you walk free would start a war. So our new king has chosen to send you to the Night's Watch.
33054,JON: There's still a Night's Watch?
33055,TYRION: The world will always need a home for bastards and broken men.
33056,JON: (sighs)
33057,"TYRION: You shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. The Unsullied wanted your head of course, but Grey Worm has accepted the justice of a life sentence. Sansa and Arya wanted you freed, but they understand our new king needs to make peace. No one is very happy. Which means it's a good compromise, I suppose."
33058,JON: Was it right? What I did?
33059,TYRION: What we did.
33060,JON: It doesn't feel right.
33061,TYRION: Ask me again in 10 years.
33062,"NARRATOR:TYRION approaches JON, and rests his hand on JON's shoulder. He starts to walk away."
33063,JON: I don't expect we'll ever see each other again.
33064,TYRION: I wouldn't be so sure. A few years as Hand of the King would make anyone want to piss off the edge of the world.
33065,JON: (nods)
33066,NARRATOR:TYRION exits.
33067,EXT: King's Landing seaward stairs.
33068,NARRATOR:JON descends the stairs. The surf roars and seagulls call. Two men of the Night's Watch await him at the bottom of the stairs. They follow him as he continues towards the water. The bay is filled with ships.
33069,CUT TO: the wharfs
33070,"NARRATOR:JON walks through the busy wharf. He looks up to see GREY WORM in the ship that he is passing. They take measure of one another, then JON looks down and continues on. An UNSULLIED CAPTAIN joins GREY WORM"
33071,UNSULLIED CAPTAIN: (in Valyrian) All the men have boarded.
33072,GREY WORM:  (in Valyrian) Good. We sail for the isle of Naath.
33073,NARRATOR:The UNSULLIED CAPTAIN nods and exits. The Unsullied prepare their ship for embarkment.
33074,CUT TO: King's Landing sea walk.
33075,"NARRATOR:JON walks along the sea wall. SANSA, ARYA and BRAN are waiting for him."
33076,SANSA: I wish there had been another way. Can you forgive me?
33077,NARRATOR:JON struggles to find any words.
33078,"JON: The North is free, thanks to you."
33079,SANSA: But they lost their king.
33080,JON: Ned Stark's daughter will speak for them. She's the best they could ask for.
33081,NARRATOR:SANSA gives JON a tearful hug. He holds her close. JON then places his hand on ARYA's shoulder.
33082,"JON: You can come see me, you know, at Castle Black."
33083,ARYA: I can't.
33084,JON: You think anyone will dare tell you women aren't allowed?
33085,ARYA: (chuckles)  I'm not going back north.
33086,SANSA: Where are you going?
33087,ARYA: What's west of Westeros?
33088,JON: (chuckles) I don't know.
33089,ARYA: No one knows. It's where all the maps stop. That's where I'm going.
33090,NARRATOR:JON and ARYA trade nods.
33091,JON: You have your Needle?
33092,ARYA: Right here.
33093,"NARRATOR:JON and ARYA embrace, tearfully. JON then kneels before BRAN."
33094,JON: Your Grace. I'm sorry I wasn't there when you needed me.
33095,BRAN: You were exactly where you were supposed to be.
33096,"NARRATOR:JON rises and sighs. He gives a last look at his three siblings, and walks to the ship's boat filled with night's watchmen."
33097,INT: King's Landing library
33098,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE sits in the library, paging through the history of the knights of Westeros. She comes to the page for Ser Jaime Lannister. It is only half written, and somewhat sloppily done. She fills his pages in careful script. She has to think about how to end the entry. Her final written line is ""Died protecting his Queen."" She closes the massive tome."
33099,INT: Small Council Chamber.
33100,"NARRATOR:TYRION enters first, and looks at the chair inscribed for the hand. He sits down and sighs. He gets up quickly to straighten the other chairs at the table to make the room more presentable. The door opens, and he sits back down at the head of the table. BRONN, DAVOS and SAM (dressed in Maester's garb) enter. BRONN and DAVOS noisily and uncouthly take their seats. TYRION quietly emits some futile protests."
33101,NARRATOR:SAM places a large book in front of TYRION.
33102,TYRION: What's this?
33103,SAM: A Song of Ice and Fire. Archmaester Ebrose's history of the wars following the death of King Robert. I helped him with the title.
33104,NARRATOR:TYRION starts to flip through the pages.
33105,TYRION: I suppose I come in for some heavy criticism.
33106,"SAM: Oh, I wouldn't say that."
33107,"TYRION: Oh, he's kind to me. Never would've guessed."
33108,NARRATOR:SAM does not respond.
33109,TYRION: He's not kind?
33110,SAM:  He -
33111,TYRION: He what? What does he say about me?
33112,"SAM: I don't believe you're mentioned, ahem."
33113,"NARRATOR:TYRION cannot believe it. BRONN smirks. TYRION pushes the book aside as the door opens. They stand as BRAN enters, his chair pushed by BRIENNE, now captain of the Kingsguard."
33114,TYRION: Your Grace.
33115,DAVOS: Your Grace.
33116,BRONN: Your Grace.
33117,SAM: Your Grace.
33118,"NARRATOR:BRIENNE places BRAN at the other head of the table. TYRION sits, and the others follow his lead. They look to BRAN."
33119,BRAN: We appear to be missing a Master of Whisperers. And a Master of Laws. And a Master of War.
33120,"TYRION: Yes, Your Grace. Suitable prospects will be brought to you for an audience in the coming weeks."
33121,BRAN: And Drogon? Any word?
33122,"SAM: He was last spotted flying east, toward--"
33123,"BRONN: The farther away, the better."
33124,BRAN: Perhaps I can find him. Do carry on with the rest.
33125,"TYRION: As you wish, Your Grace."
33126,BRIENNE: Ser Podrick.
33127,"NARRATOR:PODRICK enters, also a kingsguard. The small council stands."
33128,"TYRION: (clearing his throat) We serve at your pleasure, King Bran the Broken, ruler of the Six Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm. Long may he reign."
33129,SAM:  Long may he reign.
33130,DAVOS:  Long may he reign.
33131,BRIENNE: Long may he reign.
33132,BRONN: Long may he reign.
33133,NARRATOR:PODRICK wheels BRAN around.
33134,TYRION: That will improve.
33135,BRAN: (smiling) I'm sure it will.
33136,NARRATOR:BRAN and PODRICK exit. Everyone sits back down.
33137,"TYRION: Ser Bronn of the Blackwater, Lord of Highgarden, Lord Paramount of the Reach and Master of Coin, would you say the crown's debt to you has been paid?"
33138,"BRONN: In full, my lord Hand."
33139,TYRION: Good. Time to start incurring a new one. We have hungry people to feed. Can we expect some assistance in this regard?
33140,BRONN: Indeed we can.
33141,"TYRION: Lord Davos, we have an armada to rebuild and ports to repair."
33142,DAVOS: We have. These projects will begin as soon as the Master of Coin and Lord of Lofty Titles provides funding.
33143,"BRONN: The Master of Coin looks forward to helping the Master of Ships, but first he has to ensure we're not wasting coin, or soon there won't be no more coin."
33144,"DAVOS: ""Any more."""
33145,BRONN: You Master of Grammar now too?
33146,"SAM: Grandmaester, ahem, it is my theory, based on my years of work on the Casterly Rock sewers, that clean water leads to a healthier population."
33147,SAM: The Archmaester has done some research on this subject and it turns out--
33148,BRONN: The strong live and the weak don't.
33149,TYRION: Find the best builders and set them to the task.
33150,"BRONN: Oh, speaking of builders, all the best brothels burned down. The Master of Coin is willing to fund reconstruction."
33151,SAM: Uh the Archmaester is less than enthusiastic about the salutary effects of brothels.
33152,"BRONN: Well, I imagine he isn't using them properly."
33153,BRIENNE: I think we can all agree that ships take precedence over brothels.
33154,BRONN: I think that's a very presumptuous statement.
33155,TYRION: I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel.
33156,EXT: Castle Black.
33157,"NARRATOR:The wind whistles on a grey day at the wall. A horn sounds as JON and two night's watchmen arrive on horseback. The doors are opened for them. Jon breathes deeply, gathering his emotional strength. In the courtyard, TORMUND stands, resting. JON spurs his mount forward. The gate closes behind him."

33172,CUT TO: Castle Black
33173,NARRATOR:JON walks slowly to look out over the crowd of night's watchmen and free folk that have gathered in the snowy courtyard. He turns back without speaking.
